The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation today announced the 2024 updated asset-size thresholds used to define "small bank" and "intermediate small bank" under their current Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations. The CRA regulations establish the framework and criteria by which the relevant agencies assess a financial institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. Financial institutions are evaluated under different CRA examination procedures based upon their asset-size classification. The asset-size thresholds are adjusted annually based on the average change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which is a measure of inflation. As a result of the 4.06 percent increase in the CPI-W for the period ending in November 2023, the definitions of small banks and intermediate small banks for CRA examinations will change as follows: These asset-size thresholds are effective January 1, 2024. A list of the current and historical asset-size thresholds is availablehere.The asset-size thresholds defined by the agencies' October 2023 joint final rule to strengthen and modernize their CRA regulations will apply on January 1, 2026 and are not reflected in today's announcement.

I would like to thank the Aspen Institute for inviting me to join you at this event to discuss efforts to develop a more inclusive financial system.1It is really a pleasure to join so many stakeholders that are at the forefront of this important work. As I have often said, one of our important responsibilities is to foster an economy that works for everyone.2Consumers are better positioned to benefit from economic growth when they have access to financial products and services that responsibly meet their needs. My perspective on financial inclusion is informed, in no small part, from my own experience as a banker. Small banks, especially community banks, have a deep understanding of the local economies they serve, and can respond quickly and effectively to local needs. Indeed, financial inclusion is a core mission of community banks; but no entity or group of financial institutions alone can solve the challenge of creating a more inclusive financial system. Today, I will discuss my views on why financial inclusion is important to all of us—from community banks to central banks. I will then highlight activities in which the Federal Reserve participates to promote financial inclusion and conclude with ideas for future work and collaboration. Why Financial Inclusion Is ImportantAn inclusive financial system offers access and choices that enhance consumers' and businesses' financial well-being. From checking and savings accounts to credit and insurance, consumers benefit from having financial products and services that are affordable, safe, and responsive to their needs. Without them, consumers may turn to alternative financial services, which can often be more costly or may lead to consumer harm. An inclusive financial system recognizes that consumers come from a wide range of economic circumstances; have varied perceptions of and experiences with the banking system; and most importantly, different needs for financial products and services. And despite the general availability of online financial services, geography, location, and accessibility matter. Financial inclusion may look very different, for instance, in rural communities, compared to the suburbs of Washington, D.C., or the islands of Hawaii. The entire economy gains when more households achieve financial stability. That said, the benefits of financial inclusion do not necessarily result in the same outcomes for everyone. Federal Reserve Activities and Promising DevelopmentsThe road to fostering a more inclusive financial system is long and winding and may, at times, seem daunting. We have been on this road for some time, and the Federal Reserve and many others have already taken many promising steps. So, I'd like to share a few examples of the Fed's recent efforts to promote financial inclusion that will help to provide some context to our ongoing efforts. Supporting access to responsive products: small-dollar lendingFor many years, a variety of surveys have indicated that consumers use small-dollar credit to address temporary cash-flow imbalances, unexpected expenses, or income shortfalls during periods of economic stress or natural disasters. So, we began to consider the ways in which the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators could be helpful. Shortly after I joined the Federal Reserve, in 2019 and through 2020, we issued two interagency statements meant to provide clarity to banks on the use of alternative data for underwriting and on principles for offering responsible small-dollar loans.3Our guidance clarified that with a consumer's permission, banks can use alternative data, like checking account balance activity, to qualify them for credit. Our guidance also underscored that small-dollar lending products that support successful repayment outcomes and that avoid continuous cycles of debt due to rollover and reborrowing can help facilitate financial inclusion. We have seen some evidence that suggests the release of these small-dollar Interagency Lending Principles correlated with a subsequent increase in bank consumer lending.4Ensuring that small-dollar lending is available through depository institutions rather than through other non-depository lenders could increase the credit opportunities available to consumers at lower cost and with fewer fees. Banks may also pursue expanding their lending opportunities through technology innovations that provide mechanisms for more effective risk modelling or enhancing their online access to financial services for consumers. These advancements can result in faster loan decisionmaking, more convenient customer access, and reduced costs and risks for both banks and borrowers. Over time, we are seeing more banks incorporating these approaches to better serve clients with credit, including the use of alternative data to support underwriting. We will continue to monitor these promising developments to better understand the impact on consumers. Supporting mission-driven organizationsI will turn now to the Fed's efforts to build the institutional capacity of a set of key stakeholders: Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Women-Owned Depository Institutions (WDIs), and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), whose missions are to reach historically underserved populations. Providing support for these institutions is an important part of the Federal Reserve's mission to provide a safe, sound, and accessible banking system that protects consumers.5 Through the Fed's Partnership for Progress (PFP) program, we provide technical assistance on regulatory matters, conduct research, host convenings, and provide examiner training to support and promote the stability of MDIs and WDIs.6Research suggests that MDIs are more likely to focus their products and services to benefit diverse communities and to work with more consumers who experience credit constraints in comparison with non-MDIs.7The extent of their reach was evident during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, when they demonstrated effective contributions to the economic resiliency of their communities.8During the pandemic, MDIs and CDFIs provided Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to small businesses and financially underserved firms.9The Fed supported these important financial service providers by providing liquidity through its emergency lending program, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility.10 The Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) provided additional support to MDIs and CDFIs. Through the ECIP, MDIs and CDFIs received over $8.5 billion in low-cost capital to support the provision of loans and grants to small businesses and consumers in their communities. The Federal Reserve conducted collective webinars and individualized outreach to MDIs to encourage enrollment in the program. Our early internal analysis shows, on average, that eligible banks are using ECIP to strengthen balance sheets, build internal capacity, and enhance product offerings. As a result, we have seen ECIP recipients increase their lending about a year after receiving funds, relative to MDIs and CDFIs that did not receive ECIP funding. Supporting Central Bank Network for Indigenous InclusionThis brings me to another aspect of the Federal Reserve's efforts to support financial inclusion. The Fed recently became a member of the Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion (CBNII). This group brings together the central banks of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia with the purpose of understanding and researching related economic and financial issues, knowledge sharing, and financial education targeted to these communities.11As the Federal Reserve's network representative, I recently participated in the CBNII's biennial symposium focused on the importance of Indigenous financial inclusion.12My remarks there reiterated the view that a financial system must be inclusive for the economy to work for everyone and must include access for Indigenous communities. Our work with Indigenous groups includes all U.S. native populations, Native Hawaiian, Native Alaskan, and Native American Indians. The Fed's CBNII work is supported by many of our Reserve Bank teams, including the San Francisco Reserve Bank, the Minneapolis Center for Indian Country Development (CICD), and the St. Louis Native Economic and Financial Education Empowerment (NEFEE) program. Together, these teams and programs work with Indigenous organizations and tribal nations to provide access to economic and personal finance education incorporating Indigenous language and culture. Supporting research informing financial inclusionAs a final example, I'll highlight some of the Fed's financial inclusion data and research. Two of our most important contributions to the study of financial well-being and consumer wealth are the annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) and the triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).13Responses to these surveys are publicly available and are extensively cited by other practitioners and researchers. Researchers and practitioners also rely upon the St. Louis Reserve Bank's Bank On National Data (BOND) Hub, which was created in partnership with Cities for Financial Empowerment's Bank On program.14Through voluntary and aggregated data reporting, this resource enables the public to track the growth and usage of Bank On accounts in communities across the country. We encourage the public's continued engagement with and analysis of these important data. Looking AheadToday, I've spoken about the Fed's work in the areas of small-dollar credit, mission-driven organizations and networks, and data. Before I close, I would like to raise several issues on my mind that might prompt discussion in your event today. First, building on some progress in small-dollar credit, how can we encourage the development of lower-cost products and refine our understanding of the degree to which these products may foster consumers' financial well-being? Second, given the value of mission-driven organizations in expanding access to financial products and services in underserved communities, how can we best provide support to the activities of MDIs, WDIs, and CDFIs? Third, the CBNII relies on the participation and wisdom of Indigenous leaders and community members to advance financial inclusion. How can we leverage this model of engagement and shared learning? Financial inclusion is not a one-size-fits-all issue. Involving consumers and communities in identifying issues and crafting approaches for solutions is critical to success. Advancing financial inclusion will clearly take many hands and a diverse set of stakeholders, including everyone participating here today. ClosingIn closing, greater inclusiveness in the financial system is an ongoing priority for the Federal Reserve, and we will continue to engage on these important issues in the years to come. Progress requires collaboration, and I look forward to engaging with all of you as we continue on the journey to make our financial system more inclusive. 1.

Providing support for these institutions is an important part of the Federal Reserve's mission to provide a safe, sound, and accessible banking system that protects consumers.5 Through the Fed's Partnership for Progress (PFP) program, we provide technical assistance on regulatory matters, conduct research, host convenings, and provide examiner training to support and promote the stability of MDIs and WDIs.6Research suggests that MDIs are more likely to focus their products and services to benefit diverse communities and to work with more consumers who experience credit constraints in comparison with non-MDIs.7The extent of their reach was evident during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, when they demonstrated effective contributions to the economic resiliency of their communities.8During the pandemic, MDIs and CDFIs provided Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to small businesses and financially underserved firms.9The Fed supported these important financial service providers by providing liquidity through its emergency lending program, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility.10 The Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) provided additional support to MDIs and CDFIs. Through the ECIP, MDIs and CDFIs received over $8.5 billion in low-cost capital to support the provision of loans and grants to small businesses and consumers in their communities. The Federal Reserve conducted collective webinars and individualized outreach to MDIs to encourage enrollment in the program. Our early internal analysis shows, on average, that eligible banks are using ECIP to strengthen balance sheets, build internal capacity, and enhance product offerings. As a result, we have seen ECIP recipients increase their lending about a year after receiving funds, relative to MDIs and CDFIs that did not receive ECIP funding. Supporting Central Bank Network for Indigenous InclusionThis brings me to another aspect of the Federal Reserve's efforts to support financial inclusion. The Fed recently became a member of the Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion (CBNII). This group brings together the central banks of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia with the purpose of understanding and researching related economic and financial issues, knowledge sharing, and financial education targeted to these communities.11As the Federal Reserve's network representative, I recently participated in the CBNII's biennial symposium focused on the importance of Indigenous financial inclusion.12My remarks there reiterated the view that a financial system must be inclusive for the economy to work for everyone and must include access for Indigenous communities. Our work with Indigenous groups includes all U.S. native populations, Native Hawaiian, Native Alaskan, and Native American Indians. The Fed's CBNII work is supported by many of our Reserve Bank teams, including the San Francisco Reserve Bank, the Minneapolis Center for Indian Country Development (CICD), and the St. Louis Native Economic and Financial Education Empowerment (NEFEE) program. Together, these teams and programs work with Indigenous organizations and tribal nations to provide access to economic and personal finance education incorporating Indigenous language and culture. Supporting research informing financial inclusionAs a final example, I'll highlight some of the Fed's financial inclusion data and research. Two of our most important contributions to the study of financial well-being and consumer wealth are the annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) and the triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).13Responses to these surveys are publicly available and are extensively cited by other practitioners and researchers. Researchers and practitioners also rely upon the St. Louis Reserve Bank's Bank On National Data (BOND) Hub, which was created in partnership with Cities for Financial Empowerment's Bank On program.14Through voluntary and aggregated data reporting, this resource enables the public to track the growth and usage of Bank On accounts in communities across the country. We encourage the public's continued engagement with and analysis of these important data. Looking AheadToday, I've spoken about the Fed's work in the areas of small-dollar credit, mission-driven organizations and networks, and data. Before I close, I would like to raise several issues on my mind that might prompt discussion in your event today. First, building on some progress in small-dollar credit, how can we encourage the development of lower-cost products and refine our understanding of the degree to which these products may foster consumers' financial well-being? Second, given the value of mission-driven organizations in expanding access to financial products and services in underserved communities, how can we best provide support to the activities of MDIs, WDIs, and CDFIs? Third, the CBNII relies on the participation and wisdom of Indigenous leaders and community members to advance financial inclusion. How can we leverage this model of engagement and shared learning? Financial inclusion is not a one-size-fits-all issue. Involving consumers and communities in identifying issues and crafting approaches for solutions is critical to success. Advancing financial inclusion will clearly take many hands and a diverse set of stakeholders, including everyone participating here today. ClosingIn closing, greater inclusiveness in the financial system is an ongoing priority for the Federal Reserve, and we will continue to engage on these important issues in the years to come. Progress requires collaboration, and I look forward to engaging with all of you as we continue on the journey to make our financial system more inclusive. 1.

The Federal Reserve Board on Friday released results of a survey of senior financial officers at banks about their strategies and practices for managing reserve balances. The Senior Financial Officer Survey is used by the Board to obtain information about banks' reserve balance management strategies and practices, their deposit pricing strategies, their expectations for potential changes in both the size and composition of their balance sheets, and their views regarding Federal Reserve facilities. The most recent survey was conducted in collaboration with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York between September 22, 2023, and October 6, 2023, and includes responses from banks that held a bit more than three quarters of total banking system reserve balances at the time of the survey.

Michael S. Gibson, Director, Division of Supervision and Regulation Before the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. Watch Live Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Lynch, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss supervision and regulation as it relates to innovation in the financial system. The Federal Reserve is committed to supporting responsible innovation, both by the firms we oversee directly, and in the financial system broadly. We recognize that innovation can reinforce the safety and soundness of banks and the stability of our financial system, increase operational efficiencies, and reduce costs. Innovation can increase opportunities for financial inclusion and pave the way for new financial products and services that benefit the public. However, innovation can also lead to risks, some of which are familiar and others more novel. The Federal Reserve Board, alongside the other federal bank regulatory agencies, has a statutory responsibility to supervise banks to help ensure they operate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with all applicable laws. In keeping with that mission, we require the banks we oversee to identify and manage the risks associated with the new technologies they use. Our approach to supervising and regulating innovation in banking is based on the following overarching principles. First, activities that present fundamentally the same risks should be regulated in the same way, regardless of where or how the activity occurs or the terms used to describe the activity. If, in other words, a novel product or service raises the same risks as a traditional activity, it should be subject to the same regulation, even if it is based on new technology or described using different terminology. Second, the Federal Reserve has not taken and does not take a position on who banks can offer services to, so long as they remain within the confines of the law. Banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation. Third, we have sought to be transparent about our expectations and approaches to novel activity supervision and regulation to provide a pathway for responsible innovation. We articulate those expectations through a variety of channels, including guidance, statements, and other resources. Finally, we recognize that we also must continue to learn, which is why we engage in regular outreach. Federal Reserve staff frequently meets with banks, nonbank fintechs, academics, and others to exchange views on how technology is changing the banking sector and the financial system as a whole. These meetings provide an important window into how innovation is shaping the banking sector and are vital to helping us develop appropriate supervisory and policy actions. In keeping with these principles, the Federal Reserve recently announced the creation of a novel activities supervision program to focus on the supervision of risks posed by novel, technology-driven activities at banks.1These activities include those involving crypto-assets, distributed ledger technology, and complex technology-driven bank partnerships with nonbank fintechs. We expect this program to evolve as new technologies emerge. By dedicating a team of supervisory experts to the oversight of novel, technology-driven activities, our aim is to provide clarity as well as timely, consistent, and relevant feedback to the institutions we supervise. We want banks to continue to take advantage of innovations, while also operating in a safe and sound manner. As I noted previously, distributed ledger technology and crypto-asset-related activities are a focus of the novel activities supervision program. Distributed ledger technology offers the potential to increase efficiencies, lower costs, and increase access to financial products and services. Crypto-assets leverage the technology and are generally issued on open, public, decentralized networks. Both crypto-assets and the technology underlying them also present risks, including those related to governance and risk management of the network, and legal uncertainties around issues such as settlement finality and ownership rights. And crypto-assets' pseudonymous nature can create heightened illicit finance risks. As with all of their activities, banks engaging with the crypto-asset sector are expected to do so in a manner that is safe and sound. For example, banks with a high concentration in crypto-asset-related deposits may face heightened liquidity risks, given the significant volatility and interconnectedness in the sector, and should appropriately manage such risk.2 Beyond crypto-assets, some banks have expressed interest in more directly engaging in distributed ledger technology and tokenization of traditional assets, such as currency or securities, to expedite and automate payment, clearing, and settlement services. Digital tokens that aim to maintain a stable value relative to a government-issued currency—often referred to as "stablecoins" or "dollar tokens"—have rightly garnered significant attention, given their implications for payments and financial stability. To provide clarity for banks interested in engaging with dollar tokens, we recently issued guidance on the process by which a Federal Reserve-supervised bank can seek to obtain a supervisory non-objection before issuing, holding, or transacting in dollar tokens.3This process will allow the Federal Reserve to verify that a bank has appropriate risk management systems in place to identify and control potential risks with respect to dollar tokens, including those related to operations, cybersecurity, liquidity, illicit finance, and consumer compliance. Novel banking activities involving complex partnerships between banks and technology-intensive third parties have also been an important area of focus. Third-party relationships can offer banks, particularly community banks, access to new technologies and innovation but can also introduce risks that need to be managed, such as, for example, operational risks and consumer compliance risks. As I mentioned, the novel activities supervision program will be helping to oversee complex technology-driven bank partnerships with nonbank financial technology companies. The federal bank regulatory agencies have also recently issued guidance on third-party risk management, which lays out the agencies' supervisory expectations for all types of third-party relationships, including relationships with financial technology companies.4In addition, the agencies have released a guide designed to assist community banks to assess risks in constructing and considering relationships with fintech companies.5 Another technology that holds potential is artificial intelligence (AI). Banks are leveraging AI for a variety of applications, such as fraud monitoring and customer service. While the technology offers several benefits, it also poses risks, including data challenges, explainability, bias, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. Given these risks, it is important that banks using AI are doing so in a safe, sound, and compliant manner. Federal Reserve staff continues to work closely with the other federal bank regulatory agencies to track and learn more about emerging practices regarding banks' use of AI and related risk management. Finally, it is important to note that innovation is not confined to the private sector. The Federal Reserve is focused on finding opportunities to use innovative technology to enhance our supervision of the banking industry. We are evaluating industry-leading technology to determine if adoption of such tools will enhance our supervision technology and increase efficiency. ConclusionThe Federal Reserve is committed to supporting responsible innovation so that the financial system and the public can enjoy the many benefits innovation can offer. At the same time, we are mindful of our mission to keep the financial system safe and sound and so are focused on ensuring that any risks associated with novel financial products and services are properly managed.

Chair Jerome H. Powell At a Fireside Chat at Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia Thank you, President Gayle, and thank you for the invitation to visit today. I am fortunate to have been accompanied from Washington by a very distinguished graduate of Spelman College, Class of 1986 and member of Delta Sigma Theta, my Federal Reserve colleague Governor Lisa Cook. There is no greater testament to Spelman's historic legacy than the achievements of outstanding women like Governor Cook. One part of that legacy is Spelman's tradition of promoting education in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Governor Cook's research highlights the key role of such education in preparing individuals to be inventors and innovators who can generate ideas that will add to our body of knowledge, increase productivity, and generate higher living standards.1Her work is just one example of how Spelman women continue to make historic contributions in science, the arts, technology, medicine, and other fields. I look forward to our conversation, and I thought I might frame it by talking about the Federal Reserve's actions to promote a healthy economy, and how those actions relate to questions students in this audience may be asking about the future. For example, I am sure that students are wondering what kind of a job market and economy you will be entering when you complete your education. Congress assigned the Fed the dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Both goals are essential aspects of a healthy economy. Congress also gave the Fed a precious grant of independence from direct political control to allow us to pursue those goals without consideration of political matters. Other major central banks in democratic societies have similar grants of independence, and this institutional arrangement has a strong track record of producing better policy outcomes for the benefit of the public. To begin with our maximum employment goal, I am glad to say that, by many measures, conditions in the labor market are very strong. A couple of years ago, as the pandemic receded and the economy reopened, the number of job openings grew to greatly exceed the supply of people available to work, leaving a widespread shortage of workers. Today, labor market conditions remain very strong, and the economy is returning to a better balance between the demand for and supply of workers. The pace at which the economy is creating new jobs remains strong, and has been slowing toward a more sustainable level. That gradual slowing has come in part due to the efforts of the Fed to slow the growth of the economy to help reduce inflation. After declining sharply during the pandemic, the supply of workers has bounced back, as people have come back into the labor force and as immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Partly because of that labor force growth, the unemployment rate has edged up over the second half of the year, though it remains historically low at 3.9 percent. The increase in participation has been particularly strong among women in the prime working ages of 25 to 54, which surged to an all-time high earlier this year, and which remains well above pre-pandemic levels. Wage growth remains high but has been gradually moving toward levels that would be more consistent with 2 percent price inflation over time, and real wages are growing again as inflation declines. As for price stability, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation.2After running below 2 percent for over a decade, inflation increased sharply in 2021, in the United States and in many other countries around the world. High inflation imposes a significant hardship on all households and is especially painful for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. Beginning in early 2022, we reacted forcefully, raising our policy interest rate and decreasing the size of our balance sheet to help slow the economy and bring down inflation. Inflation has declined to 3 percent over the 12 months ending in October, but after factoring out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile, what we call "core" inflation is still 3.5 percent, well above our 2 percent objective. Over the six months ending in October, core inflation ran at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, and while the lower inflation readings of the past few months are welcome, that progress must continue if we are to reach our 2 percent objective. High inflation initially emerged from a collision between very strong demand and pandemic-constrained supply. The normalization of supply and demand conditions has played a critical role in the disinflation so far, as has the substantial tightening of monetary policy and overall financial conditions over the past two years.3The strong actions we have taken have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. Monetary policy is thought to affect economic conditions with a lag, and the full effects of our tightening have likely not yet been felt. The forcefulness of our response to inflation also helped maintain the Fed's hard-won credibility, ensuring that the public's expectations of future inflation remain well-anchored. Having come so far so quickly, the FOMC is moving forward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced.4 As the demand- and supply-related effects of the pandemic continue to unwind, uncertainty about the outlook for the economy is unusually elevated. Like most forecasters, my colleagues and I anticipate that growth in spending and output will slow over the next year, as the effects of the pandemic and the reopening fade and as restrictive monetary policy weighs on aggregate demand.5The FOMC is strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective. It would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease. We are prepared to tighten policy further if it becomes appropriate to do so. We are making decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks. That is an overview of what my colleagues and I at the Fed are trying to accomplish. The bottom line, if you are a student, is that we have made considerable progress in reducing high inflation while maintaining a strong labor market, with a lot of opportunity for new graduates. The unemployment rate has risen a bit, but it is still very low by historical standards, and by many measures it is a great time to start your career. You will face challenging decisions soon about what professions to enter, and what companies and institutions to work for. Some of you will become entrepreneurs. You have already made one really good decision, and that is coming to Spelman. Whatever opportunities and challenges emerge, education will continue to be a key to success. Higher education is an investment, and not just of money. You are investing your time and great effort to gain knowledge and skills that are preparing you for successful careers. Your success will make for a stronger economy. For our part, at the Fed we are doing our best to foster an economy that gives you the best opportunity to succeed. With that, I will hand it back to you, President Gayle. 1. See, for example Lisa D.

Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr At the ECB Forum on Banking Supervision, Frankfurt, Germany Thank you for the opportunity to speak today.1I'm delighted to be here to celebrate the retirement of Andrea Enria, my dear friend and colleague, who has done so much to strengthen the supervision and regulation of European banks throughout his career. In my remarks, I would like to provide perspective on some of the lessons learned from the banking stress experienced in the United States last spring for both banks and their supervisors. In particular, I will focus on how banks manage liquidity risk, the role of the central bank's discount window lending in this process, and the importance of robust liquidity planning for good times and bad. Last March, several large U.S. banks faced acute liquidity pressures when uninsured depositors looked at the banks' balance sheets and judged that the banks would be insolvent if they needed to liquidate their securities portfolios to meet potential outflows. The banks' poor interest rate and liquidity risk management triggered a crisis of confidence in their uninsured depositors, resulting in liquidity crises at these banks. In short, they faced old-fashioned bank runs, the speed of which was anything but old fashioned. Despite their compliance with our capital rules, these banks lacked enough capital to reassure uninsured depositors that they had sufficient resources to weather this liquidity storm. In addition to our domestic strains, Credit Suisse came under renewed pressure in March 2023 after a long period of liquidity pressures that had been acute since the fall of 2022. Of course, Credit Suisse had been a troubled bank for some time, with doubts about its future viability after the Archegos and Greensill scandals had tarnished its reputation. These concerns became reality when the firm was forced to announce that its internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective and had been for several years. Credit Suisse was acquired by UBS in a deal that involved triggering of Credit Suisse's contingent convertible capital instruments, a severe dilution of shareholders, and the removal of senior bank management, as well as emergency liquidity support and extraordinary loss sharing from the Swiss government. While there is more that regulators and supervisors can do to help to ensure banks' interest rate risk management and capital bases are sufficiently calibrated to the risks of their business models, today I will focus most of my comments on liquidity risk management and operational readiness for firms in the United States to utilize the Federal Reserve's discount window. This is not a new topic, as I have spoken about lessons from March and the importance of bank's preparedness to tap Fed facilities previously.2Today I will revisit those themes and provide some additional observations about the March stress events, including the importance of discount window preparedness relative to some specific liquidity risk factors such as uninsured deposits. A striking feature of recent U.S. experience with bank stress was that Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank struggled to cope with unprecedented deposit outflows arising from a loss of confidence of their uninsured depositors. While ultimately the amount of their outflows made it not possible for these banks to continue operating, these banks started from a state in which they were not sufficiently equipped to manage liquidity risk—including by being adequately prepared to tap the Federal Reserve's discount window. Banks that experienced spillovers during this period also struggled with insufficiently robust liquidity risk management. It is crucial that banks have a diversified range of liquidity options that they are able to access in a variety of conditions. And in the case of banks that are eligible to borrow from the Federal Reserve, discount window borrowing should be an important part of this mix. There are a few major reasons for this conclusion. First, the discount window provides funding at a predictable interest rate, namely the primary credit rate, which does not fluctuate daily, unlike interest rates on private sector liquidity sources. More specifically, the discount window is always available as a standing facility, with the primary credit rate currently set at the top of the federal funds rate target range. This rate—along with that of the standing repo facility (SRF), also set at this level—should serve as a backstop rate to short-term market interest rates and provide eligible firms with certainty about the highest rate they will face to gain liquidity against eligible assets at any given time. The discount window provides ready access to funding that can help banks manage their liquidity risks. The ability to access funding at a predictable rate through the discount window should figure importantly into banks' liquidity risk management plans under a range of scenarios. The discount window is also an important tool for monetary policy. The primary credit rate, set at the top of the target range, is a component for how we can achieve rate control under a range of conditions. To achieve our monetary policy aims, the discount window needs to be readily usable: if banks do not feel free to use the discount window when private sources of funding are more expensive, the discount window will not be an effective part of our monetary policy implementation toolkit. Banks have previously said that they are afraid of receiving negative feedback from their supervisors in the event that their sole grounds for tapping the discount window is that it is the most convenient or cheapest form of funding immediately available to them. In light of this, we at the Federal Reserve have been underlining the point to banks, supervisors, analysts, rating agencies, other market observers, and the public, through numerous channels, that using the discount window is not an action to be viewed negatively. Banks need to be ready and willing to use the discount window in good times and bad. The discount window is also an important tool of financial stability, because the Federal Reserve can provide liquidity in an array of circumstances, including those when other sources are impaired. Liquidity provision through the discount window is not reliant on the smooth functioning of private-sector funding markets. This is in contrast to most other options available to banks, including access to the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs). Moreover, banks that have pre-pledged collateral at the discount window and tested its operations are not dependent on other market infrastructure and payments systems to borrow against this collateral.3These features mean that discount window preparedness provides additional diversification benefits that can meaningfully enhance effective liquidity risk management. The experience of last March warrants reviewing to gain better insights into how well banks are positioned to borrow through the discount window. In doing so, I will discuss some observations from March in greater depth and note some potential lessons to be drawn from that experience. I will also briefly note some observations about our work on cross-border collaboration with our international counterparts. Lessons Learned: Uninsured Deposits and the Speed of Deposit LossThe speed of the bank runs in the spring of 2023 was unprecedented. The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008, the largest bank failure seen in the United States before this year, was the culmination of stresses that occurred over several weeks. The deposit losses experienced by SVB were much greater in both relative and absolute terms, and they occurred in less than 24 hours.4Digital banking and social media were factors in the rapid escalation of SVB's problems, though they were not the underlying source of vulnerability. SVB's concentrated and highly networked depositor base of venture capital firms, portfolio companies, tech and crypto companies, and high-net-worth individuals communicated quickly with one another and, in effect, coordinated the massive and rapid run.5And more fundamentally, as I said, SVB failed because of a textbook case of mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity risk. This mismanagement made depositors lose confidence in the bank's solvency, so they ran. The March stress also showed that contagion is possible among large regional banking organizations whose size and scope are well below those of banks that have been designated as globally systemically important. Liquidity stress at SVB quickly led other banks that were perceived to have weaknesses to experience outflows as well.6Those banks that came under greater pressure tended to have large unrealized losses in their securities portfolios, to rely heavily on uninsured deposits, and to have a deposit and client base focused on the technology and crypto sectors, venture capital, or high-net-worth clients. But the contagion extended beyond such banks and threatened to cause disruption more broadly to regional and community banks with traditional business models and to the banking system as a whole. The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the U.S. Department of the Treasury stepped in quickly to stop that contagion, and the strategy worked: deposit flows returned to normal, and stress in the banking system slowly abated. This experience has changed everyone's perception of the possible speed of bank runs. What occurred in two or three weeks or, in some cases, many months in previous episodes may, in the modern era, now occur in hours. These issues are top of mind as we review and consider future adjustments to the way in which we should supervise and regulate liquidity risk. Monetization IssuesWe also saw during this period that firms were not as well positioned to monetize (that is, to borrow against or be ready to sell) their assets as they should have been. Many underestimated the size and speed with which liquidity needs could appear. Banks of all sizes are expected to maintain contingency funding plans (CFPs) to meet potential stressed liquidity outflows.7In response to the Global Financial Crisis, regulators also now require large banks to maintain a multi-week buffer of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be easily converted to reserves even during times of stress.8 These HQLA buffers are essential to ensuring funding resilience at large firms. The March stress episode, however, highlighted the fact that, in practice, there can be operational impediments to a bank's ability to monetize its liquidity buffers in large volumes and in a rapid time frame in acute stress. In a world in which a bank run took place over a matter of weeks, it was reasonable to assume that a sufficient volume of the most liquid securities could be monetized to meet the demand for reserves associated with deposit withdrawals. But times have changed, and I see several flaws in our previous assumptions. First, it may be difficult for a firm to conduct significant asset sales in a short time frame without becoming the subject of adverse attention or, if the firm is large, without affecting market prices with fire sale effects and potentially leading to broader contagion. Second, the March stress underlined the possibility that private repo markets may not be a viable financing channel for banks that need to rapidly ramp up access, especially for banks that may not regularly transact in these markets, even if such repo markets can be a viable source of liquidity for banks that regularly tap such markets and have more gradual funding stresses. Sharp shifts in calls on private repo market capacity, particularly by firms experiencing stress, may not be easily met. In addition, it proved especially difficult to monetize assets in those cases in which firms held substantial amounts of longer-dated securities, with significant amounts of unrealized losses, as we saw in the experience of SVB. The experience showed that when these securities are sold and losses are realized, it understandably may send a negative signal to the market about the bank's viability. A compounding factor in these situations is that if the securities that a bank needs to sell are in held-to-maturity portfolios, the sales under acute stress can have a severe effect on the bank's balance sheet, as I discussed in a previous speech.9 Discount Window Preparedness for Times of StressWhile, as discussed, the discount window provides ready access to funding to help banks manage liquidity risks in normal conditions, it is also incredibly important that it be available to banks dealing with idiosyncratic or market-wide stress events. When other forms of funding or related market infrastructure are not immediately available, readiness to borrow via the discount window—including with prepositioned collateral—is even more crucial. In contrast to private-sector liquidity sources, the Fed can provide immediate liquidity against a wide range of collateral to one or a number of depository institutions simultaneously. This function provides additional time for a more orderly monetization. An update on contingent liquidity readiness that the bank regulatory agencies published in July also makes clear that all of the agencies understand the importance of a bank's readiness to make use of the discount window.10 The banks that failed because of the stress event that began in March had access to, and utilized, the Federal Reserve's discount window, and their failures were the result not of lack of access to the discount window but of basic mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity risk that left them effectively insolvent in the eyes of uninsured depositors and unable to stem bank runs. That said, they also faced internal operational challenges in quickly identifying and moving collateral that would have provided them additional borrowing capacity at the discount window. While this additional borrowing capacity would not have ultimately saved these banks given the speed and the severity of their deposit outflows, the lessons from managing their stress events can help others facing less acute events. Greater operational readiness can provide for greater optionality when a bank hits a bout of turbulence. Ready access to sufficient liquidity provides breathing room for a bank to determine and execute its path forward. There are two key aspects of discount window readiness: preparedness to access the discount window and prepositioning adequate amounts of collateral. In terms of preparedness, the majority of banks that are eligible to borrow from the discount window have the legal agreements in place. This is the first step. However, many of these banks had not recently tested their discount window access prior to the stress event. Engaging in testing through actual transactions at regular intervals is a key component of operational readiness. In the case of some banks, the amount of collateral prepositioned was also a tiny fraction of potentially flight-prone liabilities going into the stress event. This lack of pre-pledging is a concern for several reasons, including that certain collateral types can require more time to pledge. Less liquid collateral can take longer to be assessed and valued at the discount window, meaning that banks should not expect they can gain immediate liquidity against these assets. But these are the very assets that would be best pledged to the discount window, so that more liquid assets are held for other uses. The Intersection of Discount Window Readiness and Existing Liquidity RegulationsThe existing standards that require banks to hold HQLA buffers for self-insurance are an essential element of the regulatory framework. Requirements applying to large banks, like the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio, have meaningfully increased the resiliency of the banking system to liquidity stress and positioned large banks to deal better with a 30-day stress period. This type of self-insurance is critical to bank resilience and to the robustness of the financial system; however, these requirements may not, on their own, be sufficient to stem a rapid run. The speed of bank runs and the impediments to rapidly raising liquidity in private markets that may be needed in hours rather than days suggest it may be necessary to reexamine our requirements, including with respect to self-insurance standards and to discount window preparedness. The lessons from March also indicate that some forms of deposits, such as those from venture capital firms, high-net-worth individuals, crypto firms, and others, may be more prone to faster runs than previously assumed. As I have emphasized today, and in two previous speeches, the discount window is a tool that banks can and should use to help them respond to a wide array of conditions and provide additional time for orderly monetization of liquidity buffers in private markets, but only if banks are prepared to use it. Given these dynamics, we are currently studying what the lessons from March, and the variability in discount window preparedness across eligible banks, mean for the safety and soundness of individual banks and for the stability of the financial system more broadly. Since March, some banks have been assessing their operational readiness to tap the discount window, particularly relative to their runnable liabilities, such as uninsured deposits, and have been taking measures to test and pre-pledge assets where possible. Banks have also been reassessing their assumptions on the liquidity value of hold-to-maturity securities, given the experiences of March. International Coordination and CooperationLet me wrap up by sharing some thoughts with you on international spillovers to liquidity stress events. Episodes of financial stress have, in some instances, gone hand in hand with stress in U.S. dollar funding markets. Foreign banks, which have more limited access to dollar deposits than U.S. banks and rely more heavily on dollar wholesale funding for their operations, are particularly vulnerable to dollar liquidity strains. Of course, these banks have an important role in providing credit to the U.S. economy, and strains that they experience can affect U.S. businesses and households. In addition, dollar funding markets are global, and so strains in one segment can have broader repercussions for market functioning. Foreign banks that have branches in the United States have access to the discount window. Outside the United States, some of these firms also have access to dollar liquidity from their own central banks. The Federal Reserve maintains swap lines with foreign central banks and also maintains the Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) repo facility to provide dollar liquidity to foreign official counterparts. These facilities have proven effective in damping pressures in U.S. dollar funding markets when adverse pressures have emerged, pressures that could exacerbate strains in broader U.S. domestic financial markets. Indeed, during the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, the peak outstanding amounts for the swap lines were a little above and a little below $500 billion, respectively, making them among the most used of our liquidity facilities. As with all backstop facilities, however, it is not just their use that helps the smooth functioning of markets, but banks and central banks knowing that liquidity will be available when needed that helps to prevent liquidity hoarding and precautionary sales that can contribute to stresses. In part for this reason, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to make the swap lines and FIMA repo standing facilities, after initially setting the operations up only as temporary.11 These observations underscore the importance of our ongoing communication and collaboration with our counterparts—both other central banks and regulatory authorities—in order to ensure that we have a comprehensive understanding of evolving financial market dynamics and cross-border linkages that can affect our respective financial markets and financial institutions and also so that we can work to address gaps before pressures emerge. In my experience, these cross-border collaborations have been essential in enhancing the resilience of individual banks and the robustness of the financial system. I am grateful to my colleagues for their collaboration, and again wish to express my admiration for Andreas Enria on his retirement. Thank you. 1.
