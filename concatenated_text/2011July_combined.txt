Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve SystemFederal Deposit Insurance CorporationOffice of the Comptroller of the CurrencyOffice of Thrift Supervision The federal bank regulatory agencies today issued guidance to help ensure banking organizations practice effective counterparty credit risk (CCR) management. The guidance, issued by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, builds on existing supervisory guidance and outlines effective industry practices for CCR management. CCR is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction defaults or deteriorates in creditworthiness before the final settlement of the transaction. The guidance is intended primarily for use by banking organizations with large derivatives portfolios, as well as for supervisors as they assess and examine such institutions' CCR management. The guidance emphasizes that banking organizations should use appropriate reporting metrics and exposure limits systems, have well-developed and comprehensive stress testing, and maintain systems that facilitate measurement and aggregation of CCR across the organization. The guidance also includes sound practices for risk control functions including, but not limited to, validating models and systems, ensuring independent risk management and internal audit processes, and managing legal and operational risks.
The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced its approval of the proposal by Comerica Incorporated, Dallas, Texas, to acquire Sterling Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiary bank, Sterling Bank, both of Houston Texas. Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action.
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke Before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. Chairman Bernanke presented identical remarks before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate on July 14, 2011 Chairman Bachus, Ranking Member Frank, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semiannualMonetary Policy Report to the Congress. I will begin with a discussion of current economic conditions and the outlook and then turn to monetary policy. The Economic OutlookThe U.S. economy has continued to recover, but the pace of the expansion so far this year has been modest. After increasing at an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in the second half of 2010, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at about a 2 percent rate in the first quarter of this year, and incoming data suggest that the pace of recovery remained soft in the spring. At the same time, the unemployment rate, which had appeared to be on a downward trajectory at the turn of the year, has moved back above 9 percent. In part, the recent weaker-than-expected economic performance appears to have been the result of several factors that are likely to be temporary. Notably, the run-up in prices of energy, especially gasoline, and food has reduced consumer purchasing power. In addition, the supply chain disruptions that occurred following the earthquake in Japan caused U.S. motor vehicle producers to sharply curtail assemblies and limited the availability of some models. Looking forward, however, the apparent stabilization in the prices of oil and other commodities should ease the pressure on household budgets, and vehicle manufacturers report that they are making significant progress in overcoming the parts shortages and expect to increase production substantially this summer. In light of these developments, the most recent projections by members of the Federal Reserve Board and presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, prepared in conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in late June, reflected their assessment that the pace of the economic recovery will pick up in coming quarters. Specifically, participants' projections for the increase in real GDP have a central tendency of 2.7 to 2.9 percent for 2011, inclusive of the weak first half, and 3.3 to 3.7 percent in 2012--projections that, if realized, would constitute a notably better performance than we have seen so far this year.1 FOMC participants continued to see the economic recovery strengthening over the medium term, with the central tendency of their projections for the increase in real GDP picking up to 3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2013. At the same time, the central tendencies of the projections of real GDP growth in 2011 and 2012 were marked down nearly 1/2 percentage point compared with those reported in April, suggesting that FOMC participants saw at least some part of the first-half slowdown as persisting for a while. Among the headwinds facing the economy are the slow growth in consumer spending, even after accounting for the effects of higher food and energy prices; the continuing depressed condition of the housing sector; still-limited access to credit for some households and small businesses; and fiscal tightening at all levels of government. Consistent with projected growth in real output modestly above its trend rate, FOMC participants expected that, over time, the jobless rate will decline--albeit only slowly--toward its longer-term normal level. The central tendencies of participants' forecasts for the unemployment rate were 8.6 to 8.9 percent for the fourth quarter of this year, 7.8 to 8.2 percent at the end of 2012, and 7.0 to 7.5 percent at the end of 2013. The most recent data attest to the continuing weakness of the labor market: The unemployment rate increased to 9.2 percent in June, and gains in nonfarm payroll employment were below expectations for a second month. To date, of the more than 8-1/2 million jobs lost in the recession, 1-3/4 million have been regained. Of those employed, about 6 percent--8.6 million workers--report that they would like to be working full time but can only obtain partâtime work. Importantly, nearly half of those currently unemployed have been out of work for more than six months, by far the highest ratio in the post-World War II period. Long-term unemployment imposes severe economic hardships on the unemployed and their families, and, by leading to an erosion of skills of those without work, it both impairs their lifetime employment prospects and reduces the productive potential of our economy as a whole. Much of the slowdown in aggregate demand this year has been centered in the household sector, and the ability and willingness of consumers to spend will be an important determinant of the pace of the recovery in coming quarters. Real disposable personal income over the first five months of 2011 was boosted by the reduction in payroll taxes, but those gains were largely offset by higher prices for gasoline and other commodities. Households report that they have little confidence in the durability of the recovery and about their own income prospects. Moreover, the ongoing weakness in home values is holding down household wealth and weighing on consumer sentiment. On the positive side, household debt burdens are declining, delinquency rates on credit card and auto loans are down significantly, and the number of homeowners missing a mortgage payment for the first time is decreasing. The anticipated pickups in economic activity and job creation, together with the expected easing of price pressures, should bolster real household income, confidence, and spending in the medium run. Residential construction activity remains at an extremely low level. The demand for homes has been depressed by many of the same factors that have held down consumer spending more generally, including the slowness of the recovery in jobs and income as well as poor consumer sentiment. Mortgage interest rates are near record lows, but access to mortgage credit continues to be constrained. Also, many potential homebuyers remain concerned about buying into a falling market, as weak demand for homes, the substantial backlog of vacant properties for sale, and the high proportion of distressed sales are keeping downward pressure on house prices. Two bright spots in the recovery have been exports and business investment in equipment and software. Demand for U.S.-made capital goods from both domestic and foreign firms has supported manufacturing production throughout the recovery thus far. Both equipment and software outlays and exports increased solidly in the first quarter, and the data on new orders received by U.S. producers suggest that the trend continued in recent months. Corporate profits have been strong, and larger nonfinancial corporations with access to capital markets have been able to refinance existing debt and lock in funding at lower yields. Borrowing conditions for businesses generally have continued to ease, although, as mentioned, the availability of credit appears to remain relatively limited for some small firms. Inflation has picked up so far this year. The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose at an annual rate of more than 4 percent over the first five months of 2011, and 2-1/2 percent on a 12-month basis. Much of the acceleration was the result of higher prices for oil and other commodities and for imported goods. In addition, prices of motor vehicles increased sharply when supplies of new models were curtailed by parts shortages associated with the earthquake in Japan. Most of the recent rise in inflation appears likely to be transitory, and FOMC participants expected inflation to subside in coming quarters to rates at or below the level of 2 percent or a bit less that participants view as consistent with our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. The central tendency of participants' forecasts for the rate of increase in the PCE price index was 2.3 to 2.5 percent for 2011 as a whole, which implies a significant slowing of inflation in the second half of the year. In 2012 and 2013, the central tendency of the inflation forecasts was 1.5 to 2.0 percent. Reasons to expect inflation to moderate include the apparent stabilization in the prices of oil and other commodities, which is already showing through to retail gasoline and food prices; the still-substantial slack in U.S. labor and product markets, which has made it difficult for workers to obtain wage gains and for firms to pass through their higher costs; and the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, as measured by surveys of households, the forecasts of professional private-sector economists, and financial market indicators. Monetary PolicyFOMC members' judgments that the pace of the economic recovery over coming quarters will likely remain moderate, that the unemployment rate will consequently decline only gradually, and that inflation will subside are the basis for the Committee's decision to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy. As you know, that policy currently consists of two parts. First, the target range for the federal funds rate remains at 0 to 1/4 percent and, as indicated in the statement released after the June meeting, the Committee expects that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. The second component of monetary policy has been to increase the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities, an approach undertaken because the target for the federal funds rate could not be lowered meaningfully further. The Federal Reserve's acquisition of longer-term Treasury securities boosted the prices of such securities and caused longer-term Treasury yields to be lower than they would have been otherwise. In addition, by removing substantial quantities of longer-term Treasury securities from the market, the Fed's purchases induced private investors to acquire other assets that serve as substitutes for Treasury securities in the financial marketplace, such as corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities. By this means, the Fed's asset purchase program--like more conventional monetary policy--has served to reduce the yields and increase the prices of those other assets as well. The net result of these actions is lower borrowing costs and easier financial conditions throughout the economy.2We know from many decades of experience with monetary policy that, when the economy is operating below its potential, easier financial conditions tend to promote more rapid economic growth. Estimates based on a number of recent studies as well as Federal Reserve analyses suggest that, all else being equal, the second round of asset purchases probably lowered longer-term interest rates approximately 10 to 30 basis points.3Our analysis further indicates that a reduction in longer-term interest rates of this magnitude would be roughly equivalent in terms of its effect on the economy to a 40 to 120 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate. In June, we completed the planned purchases of $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities that the Committee initiated in November, while continuing to reinvest the proceeds of maturing or redeemed longer-term securities in Treasuries. Although we are no longer expanding our securities holdings, the evidence suggests that the degree of accommodation delivered by the Federal Reserve's securities purchase program is determined primarily by the quantity and mix of securities that the Federal Reserve holds rather than by the current pace of new purchases. Thus, even with the end of net new purchases, maintaining our holdings of these securities should continue to put downward pressure on market interest rates and foster more accommodative financial conditions than would otherwise be the case. It is worth emphasizing that our program involved purchases of securities, not government spending, and, as I will discuss later, when the macroeconomic circumstances call for it, we will unwind those purchases. In the meantime, interest on those securities is remitted to the U.S. Treasury. When we began this program, we certainly did not expect it to be a panacea for the country's economic problems. However, as the expansion weakened last summer, developments with respect to both components of our dual mandate implied that additional monetary accommodation was needed. In that context, we believed that the program would both help reduce the risk of deflation that had emerged and provide a needed boost to faltering economic activity and job creation. The experience to date with the round of securities purchases that just ended suggests that the program had the intended effects of reducing the risk of deflation and shoring up economic activity. In the months following the August announcement of our policy of reinvesting maturing and redeemed securities and our signal that we were considering more purchases, inflation compensation as measured in the market for inflation-indexed securities rose from low to more normal levels, suggesting that the perceived risks of deflation had receded markedly. This was a significant achievement, as we know from the Japanese experience that protracted deflation can be quite costly in terms of weaker economic growth. With respect to employment, our expectations were relatively modest; estimates made in the autumn suggested that the additional purchases could boost employment by about 700,000 jobs over two years, or about 30,000 extra jobs per month.4Even including the disappointing readings for May and June, which reflected in part the temporary factors discussed earlier, private payroll gains have averaged 160,000 per month in the first half of 2011, compared with average increases of only about 80,000 private jobs per month from May to August 2010. Not all of the step-up in hiring was necessarily the result of the asset purchase program, but the comparison is consistent with our expectations for employment gains. Of course, we will be monitoring developments in the labor market closely. Once the temporary shocks that have been holding down economic activity pass, we expect to again see the effects of policy accommodation reflected in stronger economic activity and job creation. However, given the range of uncertainties about the strength of the recovery and prospects for inflation over the medium term, the Federal Reserve remains prepared to respond should economic developments indicate that an adjustment in the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate. On the one hand, the possibility remains that the recent economic weakness may prove more persistent than expected and that deflationary risks might reemerge, implying a need for additional policy support. Even with the federal funds rate close to zero, we have a number of ways in which we could act to ease financial conditions further. One option would be to provide more explicit guidance about the period over which the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would remain at their current levels. Another approach would be to initiate more securities purchases or to increase the average maturity of our holdings. The Federal Reserve could also reduce the 25 basis point rate of interest it pays to banks on their reserves, thereby putting downward pressure on short-term rates more generally. Of course, our experience with these policies remains relatively limited, and employing them would entail potential risks and costs. However, prudent planning requires that we evaluate the efficacy of these and other potential alternatives for deploying additional stimulus if conditions warrant. On the other hand, the economy could evolve in a way that would warrant a move toward less-accommodative policy. Accordingly, the Committee has been giving careful consideration to the elements of its exit strategy, and, as reported in the minutes of the June FOMC meeting, it has reached a broad consensus about the sequence of steps that it expects to follow when the normalization of policy becomes appropriate. In brief, when economic conditions warrant, the Committee would begin the normalization process by ceasing the reinvestment of principal payments on its securities, thereby allowing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to begin shrinking. At the same time or sometime thereafter, the Committee would modify the forward guidance in its statement. Subsequent steps would include the initiation of temporary reserve-draining operations and, when conditions warrant, increases in the federal funds rate target. From that point on, changing the level or range of the federal funds rate target would be our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy in response to economic developments. Sometime after the first increase in the federal funds rate target, the Committee expects to initiate sales of agency securities from its portfolio, with the timing and pace of sales clearly communicated to the public in advance. Once sales begin, the pace of sales is anticipated to be relatively gradual and steady, but it could be adjusted up or down in response to material changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions. Over time, the securities portfolio and the associated quantity of bank reserves are expected to be reduced to the minimum levels consistent with the efficient implementation of monetary policy. Of course, conditions can change, and in choosing the time to begin policy normalization as well as the pace of that process, should that be the next direction for policy, we would carefully consider both parts of our dual mandate. Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions. 1. Note that these projections do not incorporate the most recent economic news, including last Friday's labor market report.Return to text 2. The Federal Reserve's recently completed securities purchase program has changed the average maturity of Treasury securities held by the public only modestly, suggesting that such an effect likely did not contribute substantially to the reduction in Treasury yields. Rather, the more important channel of effect was the removal of Treasury securities from the market, which reduced Treasury yields generally while inducing private investors to hold alternative assets (the portfolio reallocation effect). The substitution into alternative assets raised their prices and lowered their yields, easing overall financial conditions.Return to text 3.

Chiarman Ben S. Bernanke Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shelby, and other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the first anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act).1 On this anniversary, it is worth reminding ourselves of why the Congress passed sweeping financial reforms a year ago. The financial crisis of 2008-09 was unprecedented in its scope and severity. Some of the world's largest financial firms collapsed or nearly did so, sending shock waves through the highly interconnected global financial system. Critical financial markets came under enormous stress. Asset prices fell sharply and flows of credit to American families and businesses were disrupted. The crisis, in turn, wreaked havoc on the U.S. and global economies, causing sharp declines in production and trade and putting millions out of work. Extraordinary actions by authorities around the world helped stabilize the situation, but, nearly three years later, the recovery from the crisis in the United States and in many other countries remains far from complete. In response to the crisis, we have seen a comprehensive re-thinking and reform of financial regulation, both in the United States and around the world. Among the core objectives of both the Dodd-Frank Act and the global regulatory reform effort are: enhancing regulators' ability to monitor and address threats to financial stability, strengthening both the prudential oversight and resolvability of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), and improving the capacity of financial markets and infrastructures to absorb shocks. I will briefly discuss each of these objectives. First, to help regulators better anticipate and prepare for threats to financial stability, legislatures in both the United States and other developed economies have instructed central banks and regulatory agencies to adopt what has been called amacroprudentialapproach to supervision and regulation--that is, an approach that supplements traditional supervision and regulation of individual firms or markets with explicit consideration of threats to the stability of the financial system as a whole. Under a macroprudential approach, regulators are enjoined not only to look for emerging financial risks but also to try to identify structural weaknesses or gaps in the regulatory system, thereby helping the regulatory framework keep pace with financial innovation and other market developments. As you know, the Dodd-Frank Act created a council of regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to coordinate efforts to identify and mitigate threats to U.S. financial stability across a range of institutions and markets. The Council's monitoring efforts are well under way, and this new organization has contributed to what has been a very positive atmosphere of consultation and coordination among its member agencies. The Council is also moving forward with its rulemaking responsibilities, including rules under which it will be able to designate systemically important nonbank financial institutions and financial market utilities for additional supervisory oversight, including by the Federal Reserve. For its part, the Federal Reserve has also made organizational changes to promote a macroprudential approach to regulation. Among these changes is the establishment of high-level, multidisciplinary working groups to oversee the supervision of large, complex banking firms and financial market utilities, with a strong focus on developments that have implications for financial stability. We have also created an Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research to help coordinate our efforts to identify and analyze potential risks to the broader financial system and to serve as liaison with the Council. A second major objective of financial reform is to mitigate the threats to financial stability posed by the too-big-to-fail problem. Here the Dodd-Frank Act takes a two-pronged approach. The first prong empowers the Federal Reserve to reduce a SIFI's probability of failure through tougher prudential regulation and supervision, including enhanced risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, single-counterparty credit limits, stress testing, an early remediation regime, and activities restrictions. The Federal Reserve and other agencies face the ongoing challenge of aligning domestic regulations with international agreements, including the Basel III requirements for globally active banks. These efforts are going well; in particular, the Federal Reserve expects to issue proposed rules on the oversight of SIFIs later this summer and, working with other banking agencies, is on schedule to implement Basel III. Ending too-big-to-fail also requires allowing a SIFI to fail if it cannot meet its obligations--and to do so without inflicting serious damage on the broader financial system. Thus, the second prong of the Dodd-Frank Act's effort to end too-big-to-fail empowers the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to reduce the effect on the system in the event of a SIFI's failure through tools such as the new orderly liquidation authority and improved resolution planning by firms and supervisors. In particular, the Federal Reserve is working with the FDIC to require SIFIs to better prepare for their own resolution by adopting so-called living wills. A joint final rule on living wills is expected later this summer. Reducing the likelihood of a severe financial crisis also requires strengthening the resilience of our financial markets and infrastructure--a third major objective of the Dodd-Frank Act. Toward that end, provisions of the act improve the transparency and stability of the over-the-counter derivatives markets and strengthen the oversight of financial market utilities and other critical parts of our financial infrastructure. We and our colleagues at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other agencies are moving this work forward, in consultation as appropriate with foreign regulators and international bodies. The U.S. agencies are also working together to address structural weaknesses in areas not specifically addressed by the Dodd-Frank Act, such as the triparty repo market and the money market mutual fund industry. To be sure, any sweeping reform comes with costs and uncertainties. In implementing the statute, the Federal Reserve is committed to the promulgation of rules that are economically sensible, appropriately weigh costs and benefits, protect smaller community institutions, and, most important, promote the sound extension of credit in the service of economic growth and development. A full transition to the new system will require much more work by both the public and private sectors, and no doubt we will learn lessons along the way. However, as we work together to implement financial reform, we must not lose sight of the reason that we began this process: ensuring that events like those of 2008 and 2009 are not repeated. Our long-term economic health requires that we do everything possible to achieve that goal. Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions. Appendix (PDF) 1.

Sandra F. Braunstein, Director, Division of Consumer and Community Affairs Before the Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing, and Community Opportunity, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. IntroductionChairwoman Biggert, Ranking Member Gutierrez, and Members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to appear today to discuss regulatory actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board to address the recent challenges in the home mortgage market and to enhance consumer protections for homeowners. The Federal Reserve is committed to promoting sustainable homeownership through responsible mortgage lending. While the expansion of the subprime mortgage market increased consumers' access to credit, homeowners and communities suffered from lax underwriting standards and other unfair or deceptive practices that resulted in unsustainable loans. Over the past three years, the Board has engaged in a series of rulemakings designed to reform mortgage lending. In addition to direct consumer benefits, protecting borrowers with responsible underwriting standards and other regulatory reforms can provide a broader benefit by enhancing the integrity, consistency, and proper functioning of the mortgage market and, thereby, increasing investor confidence. The Federal Reserve's goal has been to craft clear rules that deter abuses while preserving the ability of responsible lenders to meet the needs of all segments of the market, including traditionally underserved borrowers and communities. Specifically, during this time, the Board comprehensively addressed the need for mortgage reform by issuing seven final rules under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) plus five additional proposed rules that will become the responsibility of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the Bureau). These 12 rulemakings cover all stages of the mortgage lending process, including pre-application advertising, loan origination, appraisals, underwriting, disclosures, loan servicing, and assignment of the loan to investors. In my testimony today, I will first summarize the Board's rules to expand the substantive protections for consumer mortgage transactions. I will then discuss the Board's efforts to improve mortgage disclosures and the status of those proposals in light of the upcoming transfer of authority to the Bureau. I. The Board's Efforts to Expand Substantive Protections for Consumer MortgagesA. The 2008 HOEPA RulemakingFollowing a series of public hearings, extensive research, and outreach to consumer groups, industry representatives, and other state and federal agencies, in July 2008, the Board used its authority under TILA and HOEPA to issue final rules establishing sweeping new regulatory protections for consumers in the residential mortgage market. Importantly, these rules apply to all mortgage lenders, not just depository institutions supervised by the federal banking and thrift agencies. In response to specific problems we saw in the subprime market, some restrictions in the final rules apply only to higher-priced mortgage loans. Other provisions, however, apply to all mortgage loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. In addition to rules that protect consumers from unfair or abusive lending and mortgage-servicing practices, these rules also govern mortgage advertisements to ensure they provide accurate and balanced information and do not contain misleading or deceptive representations. Another component of the final rules ensures that for all types of mortgage loans, consumers receive transaction-specific cost disclosures early enough to use while shopping for credit. 1. Protections for Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans The Board's HOEPA rules added four key protections for a newly defined category of "higher-priced mortgage loans." These loans are defined as consumer-purpose loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling and having an annual percentage rate (APR) that exceeds the average prime offer rate for comparable transactions by at least 1-1/2 percentage points for firstâlien loans, or 3-1/2 percentage points for subordinate lien loans.1 These four protections for higher-priced mortgage loans are as follows: Underwriting Requirements.The July 2008 rules prohibit lenders from making any higher-priced mortgage loan without regard to the borrower's ability to repay the obligation from income and assets other than the home. First, lenders are prohibited from making "stated income" loans. Lenders are required in each case to verify the income and assets they rely upon to determine the borrower's repayment ability. Lenders also must consider and verify the borrower's other debt obligations, such as through the use of a credit report. The final rule is intended to ensure that creditors do not assess repayment ability using overstated incomes or understated payment obligations. The rule is sufficiently flexible to allow lenders to adapt their underwriting process to accommodate a borrower's particular circumstances, such as when the borrower is self-employed. Second, lenders are presumed to comply with the ability-to-pay requirement only if they take into account the highest scheduled payment in the first seven years of the loan, rather than the consumer's initial monthly payment. For example, for an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) with a discounted initial interest rate that is fixed for the first five years, the lender determines repayment ability using the scheduled payment in the sixth and seventh years, which is based on the fully indexed rate. I should note that the underwriting requirements legislated in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), which apply to all mortgage loans, are substantially similar, but not identical to the ability-to-repay requirements adopted by the Board in 2008 for higher-priced mortgage loans. I will discuss the Board's proposal to implement the Dodd-Frank Act "ability-to-repay" provisions later in my testimony. Restrictions on Prepayment Penalties.Prepayment penalties can prevent borrowers from refinancing their loans to avoid monthly payment increases or if their loan becomes unaffordable for other reasons. Under the final rules, prepayment penalties are prohibited if the loan's monthly payment can change during the initial four years after consummation. For other higherâpriced loans, a prepayment penalty cannot last for more than two years. Escrow Accounts.The Board's July 2008 rules also require creditors to establish an escrow account for property taxes and homeowner's insurance for all first-lien mortgage loans above the higher-priced threshold. This addresses the concern that the absence of escrows in the subprime market increases the risk that consumers' borrowing decisions will be based on misleading low payment quotes that do not reflect the true cost of their homeownership obligations. The rule preserves consumer choice by permitting creditors to allow consumers to opt out of the escrow account after 12 months. Subsequently, the Dodd-Frank Act codified the final rules' requirement for establishing escrow accounts, with some modifications and additions. The Dodd-Frank Act escrow provisions are the subject of a proposed rulemaking, which I will describe later in my testimony. 2. Protections for All Loans Secured by a Consumer's Principal Dwelling In addition to the rules for higher-priced loans, the July 2008 final rules adopted the following protections that apply to all mortgage loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. Appraisal Independence.The final rules include provisions designed to protect the integrity of the appraisal process. These rules seek to ensure that real estate appraisers are free to use their independent professional judgment in assigning home values. Accordingly, the Board's rules prohibit lenders or brokers from coercing, influencing, or otherwise encouraging an appraiser to misstate or misrepresent the value of the property. The rules also prohibit a creditor from extending credit when the creditor has reason to know that the appraiser was encouraged to misstate or misrepresent the value of the dwelling, unless the creditor determines that the appraisal was accurate, or the creditor bases its decision on a separate appraisal that is untainted by coercion. Subsequently, the Dodd-Frank Act codified the anti-coercion provisions in the Board's rules, with some modifications and additions, including a provision requiring that independent appraisers receive customary and reasonable compensation for their services. The Board implemented these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act in an interim final rule, which I will discuss later in more detail. Unfair Loan Servicing Practices.The Board also prohibited loan servicers from engaging in certain unfair billing practices. Specifically, the final rules prohibit servicers from failing to credit a payment to a consumer's account as of the date received. The rules also prohibit the "pyramiding" of late fees. Under the rules, servicers may not impose a late fee on a consumer when the consumer's payment was timely and made in full except for its failure to include a previously assessed late fee. In addition, the rules prohibit loan servicers from failing to provide a loan payoff statement on a timely basis after receiving a request from the consumer or any person acting on the consumer's behalf. Advertising Rules.The final rules also seek to ensure that mortgage loan advertisements do not contain misleading or deceptive representations. Thus, the rules require that advertisements for both closed-end loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) provide accurate and balanced information about rates, monthly payments, and other features in a clear and conspicuous manner. In addition, the Board used its authority under HOEPA to prohibit several deceptive or misleading advertising practices in advertisements for closed-end mortgage loans.2For example, an advertisement for a variable rate loan may not use the word "fixed" in referring to the interest rate or payment unless the advertisement includes an equally prominent statement of the time period for which the rate or payment is fixed. The rules also prohibit misrepresentations about government endorsement of the loan program and misleading claims of "debt elimination." Earlier Cost Disclosures.To assist consumers in navigating today's complex market for mortgage products, the final rules require lenders to provide consumers with transaction-specific cost disclosures earlier in the application process, so that they can be used by consumers while shopping for a mortgage loan. Under the July 2008 rules, creditors must provide a good faith estimate of the loan costs and scheduled payments within three days after the creditor receives the consumer's application. The rule applies to any closed-end home-secured loan, including home refinance loans and home-equity loans. (Previously, early cost estimates were required only for home-purchase loans.) To ensure that consumers are able to use the information when comparing mortgage loans, consumers cannot be charged any fee until after they receive the early disclosures, except a reasonable fee for obtaining the consumer's credit history.3 B. The Board's Rules on Loan Originator CompensationIn September 2010, the Board issued a final rule regulating mortgage originator compensation practices to fulfill its responsibility under HOEPA to prohibit practices in connection with mortgage loans that the Board finds to be unfair or deceptive. The effective date of the rule was delayed until April 2011 to provide sufficient time for creditors and loan originators to make the necessary adjustments to their compensation agreements and practices. The final rule addresses the two basic ways in which originator compensation is paid. In so-called "creditor-pay" transactions, the lender makes a payment to the loan originator, which is funded by the consumer's payment of a higher interest rate. In the second model, called "consumer-pay" transactions, the consumer pays the loan originator directly, either from existing funds or from the loan proceeds. The final rule regulates the manner in which loan originators may be compensated, but not the amount. The rule has three major components. First, with respect to "creditor-pay" transactions, the Board's rule prohibits loan originators from receiving compensation in an amount "that is based on any of the transaction's terms or conditions," except the amount of credit extended. This rule applies to loan originator compensation that is paid by a bank or other creditor to its loan officer employees as well as to compensation paid by the creditor to a mortgage broker. This portion of the rule is designed to address the concern that loan originators who are paid out of the interest rate in the form of a "yield spread premium" have a conflict of interest in their dealings with consumers because originators have a personal incentive to offer the consumer an interest rate that is higher than the best rate for which the consumer qualified. Under the rule, consumers still have the option of funding their upfront closing costs, including originator compensation, through a higher interest rate, as long as the amount of originator compensation does not vary based on the rate or other loan terms. Second, for consumer-pay transactions, the final rule states that if the consumer directly compensates a loan originator, compensation may not be paid to a loan originator by any other person in connection with the transaction. This provision addresses the problem that loan originators were frequently compensated by both the consumer and the creditor in a manner that was not transparent to consumers and that could lead consumers to believe, wrongly, that by paying a loan originator directly, the loan originator would work on their behalf to find the most favorable loan. One consequence of this prohibition is that in consumer-pay transactions, a mortgage brokerage firm that is paid directly by the consumer may not pay a commission specific to that transaction to its loan officer.4Because the restriction only covers payments that are specific to the particular transaction, a brokerage firm that is paid by the consumer directly can still provide its loan officers with incentive compensation (in addition to salaries or hourly wages) without violating the rule.5 Finally, the final rule prohibits loan originators from "steering" consumers to consummate a transaction with a particular creditor based on the fact that the loan originator will receive greater compensation from that creditor. This provision responds to concerns that in creditor-pay transactions, a mortgage broker who works with a number of creditors could influence the consumer to consummate a loan with the creditor whose compensation of the loan originator is highest, even though the loan carries a higher interest rate and is not in the consumer's interest. Thus, this aspect of the final rule applies only in creditor-pay transactions. In March 2011, two lawsuits were filed by trade associations representing mortgage brokers challenging the Board's September 2010 final rule on loan originator compensation. Brokers' representatives asserted that the Board should not have issued final rules but should have instead allowed the Bureau to address the issue of loan originator compensation in a future rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act. The brokers also asserted that consumer disclosures should be sufficient to allow consumers to make informed decisions and that substantive restrictions are not needed. Both lawsuits have been dismissed, and compliance with the Board's rules has been mandatory since April. The Board issued the September 2010 final rules after giving much consideration to various alternatives. Concerns had been raised during the mortgage crisis that some consumers obtained unaffordable loans that carried interest rates that were higher than the best rate for which they qualified. In response to increasing mortgage defaults, in 2007 the Board held hearings and solicited public comments on how the Board might use its rulemaking authority to prevent abuses in the subprime lending market while still preserving responsible lending. Commenters raised concerns about the fairness and transparency of creditors' practice of compensating brokers out of the yield spread premium. These commenters noted that consumers generally are not aware of these payments from creditors to brokers, or that such payments increase consumers' interest rates. Commenters also stated that consumers may mistakenly believe that a broker seeks to obtain the best interest rate available for them. To address the heightened concerns regarding the conflict of interest presented by mortgage broker compensation, in January 2008, the Board proposed a rule that would require mortgage brokers to disclose clearly and conspicuously to consumers their total compensation (including any portion paid by the creditor as a "yield spread premium") before obtaining the consumer's written agreement. Brokers would also have to disclose that a creditor payment to the broker could influence the broker to offer the consumer loan terms that would not be in the consumer's interest or were not the most favorable terms the consumer could obtain. Representatives of mortgage brokers opposed this disclosure proposal.6Brokers also opposed disclosures concerning loan originator compensation that were adopted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 2008 under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Based on the results of consumer testing and other information, the Board declined to adopt the proposed disclosures for mortgage broker compensation when the Board issued the July 2008 final rules under HOEPA. The Board had anticipated that the proposed disclosures would increase transparency and increase competition in the market for brokerage services. However, the results of the Board's one-on-one interviews with consumers suggested that the proposed agreement and disclosures would confuse consumers and undermine their decision making rather than improve it. Concluding that disclosures alone would not be sufficient to allow consumers to avoid unfair practices related to loan originator compensation, in August 2009, the Board proposed to use its authority under HOEPA to adopt substantive rules that would prohibit certain originator compensation practices that the Board found to be unfair. The September 2010 final rules on originator compensation are substantially similar to the Board's August 2009 proposal. In issuing the final rules, the Board considered the recently enacted provisions in Section1403 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which address the same concerns. The Board believed that the rules it proposed in August 2009 were consistent with the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Board recognized, however, that there were some differences and that, as drafted, the Board's proposal would not fully implement the provisions in Section 1403. Changes to the Board's proposal to implement Section 1403 would have called for the issuance of a new proposed rulemaking.7The Board determined the best way to effectuate Section 1403's legislative purpose and eliminate, without further delay, the unfair practices that the Congress sought to prohibit was to finalize the 2009 proposal. Going forward, the Bureau will be responsible for issuing rules that fully implement the loan originator provisions in Section 1403. C. Rules Implementing Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank ActTitle XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act constitutes the "Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act." Among other things, Title XIV amends TILA to establish minimum underwriting standards to implement the statute's requirement that creditors determine that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Title XIV also imposes new requirements for loan originators, high-cost mortgages, escrow accounts, and residential real estate appraisals. The Board's general rulemaking authority under TILA will transfer to the Bureau on the designated transfer date, which is July 21, 2011. Prior to that date, the Board continues to be responsible for implementing TILA, including the amendments made by Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act. Accordingly, following enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Board has continued to fulfill its statutory responsibilities under TILA by issuing regulatory proposals to implement the provisions in Title XIV. 1. Appraisal Independence Independent and credible real estate valuations are critical to prudent residential mortgage lending. The information that appraisals provide on a property's market value also assists consumers in making informed borrowing decisions. Thus, federal banking regulators have stressed to financial institutions the importance of quality appraisals and an independent appraisal process. Federal banking agencies initially adopted prudential appraisal regulations for the institutions they supervise in 1990, and subsequently issued supervisory guidance clarifying the agencies' expectations for institutions' appraisal process.8 The most recent supervisory guidance, issued by the agencies in 2010, reflects recent changes in industry appraisal practices including lenders' increased use of third-party appraisal management companies (AMCs). These guidelines remind financial institutions that, if a third party performs all or part of their appraisal function, the institutions remain responsible for ensuring that the third party complies with all applicable laws and regulations. As I discussed earlier, in July 2008, the Board issued final rules to strengthen the valuation process. These rules prohibited coercion of appraisers by creditors, mortgage brokers, and their affiliates. Subsequently, the Dodd-Frank Act codified the anti-coercion provisions in the Board's July 2008 final rules, while also making some modifications and additions, including a provision requiring that independent appraisers receive customary and reasonable compensation for their services. The Dodd-Frank Act directed the Board to issue interim final rules to implement the act's appraisal independence provisions within 90 days after enactment. Consistent with this mandate, in October 2010, the Board issued for public comment interim final rules on appraisal independence. These interim final rules include several provisions that protect the integrity of the appraisal process. As with the Board's 2008 final rules, the interim final rules prohibit coercion and other similar actions designed to cause appraisers to base the appraised value of properties on factors other than their independent judgment. For example, they prohibit a party from withholding or threatening to withhold timely payment from a person that prepares an appraisal because the person did not value the consumer's principal dwelling at or above a certain amount. The 2010 interim final rules also prohibit appraisers and appraisal management companies from having a financial or other interest in the property or the credit transaction that is the subject of the appraisal. To facilitate compliance, the interim final rules provide a "safe harbor" for creditors that observe certain restrictions on the selection, supervision, and compensation of appraisers. Under the interim final rules, a creditor or settlement service provider that has information about material misconduct by an appraiser must file a report with the appropriate state licensing authorities. To protect the quality of appraisals, the Dodd-Frank Act also requires that a creditor and its agent pay an independent "fee appraiser" at a rate that is that is customary and reasonable for the geographic market where the property is located. To implement this provision, the interim final rules do not establish a minimum fee schedule, but instead provide two alternative methods that creditors or their agents may use to establish an appropriate fee. First, a creditor and its agent are presumed to comply if the fee amount paid to the appraiser is reasonably related to the recent rates paid for appraisal services in the relevant geographic market and the creditor or agent has adjusted the recent rate after taking into account specified factors, such as the type of property, the scope of work, and the appraiser's qualifications and experience.9 Second, a creditor or its agent is also presumed to comply if it determines the fee by relying on third-party information, such as a government agency fee schedule, an academic study, or an independent private-sector survey. Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act's requirements, third-party surveys and similar studies must not include fees paid to appraisers by appraisal management companies. Compliance with the interim final rules on appraisal independence became mandatory on April 1, 2011. Thus, the rules have only been in effect for a little more than 90 days. During this time, some fee appraisers have reported that the fees offered by appraisal management companies have not increased as they had expected, and therefore, they express concern about whether appraisal management companies are complying with the "customary and reasonable" fee requirement. However, such determinations must be made case-by-case, based on the particular facts and circumstances. The Board has and will continue to review such complaints for the institutions it supervises, while forwarding complaints about other institutions to the appropriate federal or state agency. Going forward, the Board and the other federal banking agencies, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Bureau, will share responsibility for jointly issuing permanent rules on appraisal independence. In developing permanent rules, we will consider the public comments received on the October 2010 interim final rules as well as the experience we have gained through the examination process and the handling of the complaints we have received since the interim rules became effective. 2. Escrow Accounts As discussed previously, in July 2008, the Board issued final rules requiring creditors to establish an escrow account for property taxes and homeowner's insurance for all higher-priced first-lien mortgage loans. This requirement addresses the concern that the absence of escrows in the subprime market increases the risk that consumers' borrowing decisions will be based on misleading low payment quotes that do not reflect the true cost of their homeownership obligations. Under these rules, a creditor may allow consumers to opt out of the escrow account after 12 months. In March 2011, the Board issued a final rule to implement a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that increased the annual percentage rate (APR) threshold used to determine whether a mortgage lender is required to establish an escrow account for "jumbo" mortgage loans. Jumbo loans are loans that exceed the conforming loan-size limit for purchase by Freddie Mac, as specified by the legislation. Under the July 2008 final rules, a first-lien mortgage loan is considered a higher-priced mortgage loan if its APR is 1-1/2 percentage points or more above the current average prime offer rate. As amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, the escrow requirement applies to first-lien jumbo loans only if the loan's APR is 2-1/2 percentage points or more above the average prime offer rate. The March 2011 final rule became effective on April 1, 2011. Also in March 2011, the Board published proposed rules to implement changes to the escrow account requirement that are mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed rules would expand the minimum period for mandatory escrow accounts from one to five years and, under certain circumstances, such as when the consumer is delinquent or in default, for a longer period of time. In addition, the proposal would establish two new disclosures relating to escrow accounts. One disclosure would be required three business days before consummation of a mortgage transaction for which an escrow account will be established. This disclosure would explain, among other things, what an escrow account is and how it works, and would state the risk of not having an escrow account. The Dodd-Frank Act requires such a disclosure for higherâpriced mortgage loans that have mandatory escrow accounts, but the Board proposed to require the same disclosure for all mortgage loans that have escrow accounts. The second disclosure would be given to consumers before a mortgage transaction is consummated without an escrow account or before an escrow account on an existing mortgage loan will be cancelled. This disclosure would explain escrow accounts, the risk of not having an escrow account, and the potential consequences of failing to pay home-related costs, such as taxes and insurance, in the absence of an escrow account. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Board is authorized to exempt certain creditors from the escrow requirements if they operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas and originate a limited number of loans that they hold in portfolio. Creditors would be eligible for the exemption if they annually originate and retain the servicing rights to 100 or fewer loans and do not otherwise maintain escrow accounts for the mortgage loans they service. The proposed rule seeks to exempt creditors that meet the statutory criteria and that cannot cost-effectively establish escrow accounts. The exemption would permit these creditors to continue offering mortgage credit to consumers rather than leave the higher-priced loan market. Consistent with the exemption's purpose, the proposed rule would limit the definition of "rural" to those areas most likely to have only limited sources of mortgage credit. 3. Dodd-Frank Act Requirements on Ability-to-Repay In April 2011,the Board published for public comment proposed rules that would implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that seek to strengthen mortgage underwriting procedures. The statute requires a creditor to make a reasonable and good faith determination that the consumer will have a reasonable ability to make the mortgage payments, including any mortgage-related obligations (such as property taxes). The Board's existing rules prohibit a creditor from making a higher-priced mortgage loan without regard to the consumer's ability to make the loan payments from income or assets other than the home. The Dodd-Frank Act expands the ability-to-repay requirement to cover any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling regardless of how the loan is priced (excluding open-end credit plans, timeshare plans, reverse mortgages, and temporary loans). Consistent with the act, the Board's proposed rule would provide four options for complying with the ability-to-repay requirement. First, a creditor can meet the general abilityâtoârepay standard by considering and verifying specified underwriting factors, such as the consumer's income or assets. Second, a creditor can make a "qualified mortgage," which provides the creditor with special protection from liability provided the loan does not have certain features, such as negative amortization or balloon payment; the fees are within specified limits; and the creditor underwrites the mortgage payment using the maximum interest rate in the first five years. Third, a creditor operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas can make a qualified mortgage with a balloon payment. This option is meant to preserve access to credit for consumers located in rural or underserved areas where banks originate balloon loans to hedge against interest rate risk for loans held in portfolio. Finally, a creditor can refinance a "nonâstandard mortgage" with risky features into a more stable "standard mortgage" with a lower monthly payment. This option is meant to preserve access to streamlined refinancing. Because rulemaking authority for TILA will transfer to the Bureau on July 21, 2011, the Board will not finalize this proposal. Public comments are due on July 22, 2011. Comments received by the Board will be transferred to the Bureau, which will assume responsibility for developing final rules. II. The Board's Efforts to Improve Mortgage DisclosuresThe Board issued three regulatory proposed rules as part of its comprehensive review of mortgage disclosures under TILA. The first phase of the review consisted of two proposals issued in August 2009, which would reform the consumer disclosures under TILA for closed-end mortgage loans and HELOCs. A third proposal, issued in September 2010, proposed changes to the disclosures for reverse mortgages, new disclosures for loan modifications, restrictions on certain advertising practices and sales practices for reverse mortgages, and changes to the disclosure obligations of loan servicers. The third proposal also included changes to the disclosures consumers receive explaining their right to rescind certain loans and would have clarified the responsibilities of the creditor if a consumer exercises this rescission right. In response to the three proposals, the Board received more than 5,000 comments expressing divergent views on many substantive and technical issues. A. Closed-end Mortgage DisclosuresTo shop for and understand the cost of credit, consumers must be able to identify and understand the key terms of the mortgage. In formulating proposed revisions to Regulation Z, which implements TILA, the Board used the results of consumer testing to ensure that the most essential information is provided at a suitable time using content and formats that are clear and conspicuous. With this in mind, in August 2009, the Board proposed to revise the disclosures for closed-end mortgage loans to highlight potentially risky features such as adjustable rates, prepayment penalties, and negative amortization. The disclosure would also show consumers how much their monthly payment might increase for an adjustable rate loan. The Board also proposed to improve the disclosure of the APR so it captures most of the fees and settlement costs paid by consumers. As proposed, lenders would be required to include in the disclosure a graph that illustrates how the consumer's APR compares to the average rate offered to borrowers with excellent credit. The Board also proposed to require lenders to provide final TILA disclosures so that consumers receive them in all cases at least three business days before loan closing, even if there have been no changes from the early estimate provided at application. B. HELOC DisclosuresThe Board also proposed in August 2009 an entirely new disclosure regime for HELOCs. The proposal addressed the timing, content, and format of the disclosures creditors provide throughout the life of these open-end credit plans. In addition, the HELOC proposal would strengthen protections for consumers who have their home equity lines suspended or reduced in a declining market. Currently, consumers receive lengthy, generic disclosures at application. Under the proposal, consumers would receive at application a new one-page summary containing basic information about HELOCs and the associated risks. Shortly after application, consumers would receive a disclosure that reflects the specific terms of their credit plans. At account opening, lenders would provide final disclosures in the same format to facilitate comparison with the earlier disclosures. Throughout the life of the plan, lenders would provide enhanced periodic statements, showing the total amount of interest and fees charged for the statement period and the year to date. In addition, the proposal would prohibit creditors from terminating an account for payment-related reasons unless the consumer is more than 30 days late in making a payment. The Board further proposed to strengthen the consumer protections that apply when a consumer's credit line has been suspended or reduced, such as when property value has declined. Creditors would have to provide additional information about the reasons for the action and about the consumers' right to request reinstatement of the credit line. The rules also would require lenders to promptly investigate and respond to consumers' requests to have their credit lines reinstated. C. Reverse MortgagesIn September 2010, the Board proposed significant changes to enhance consumer protections for reverse mortgage transactions. Under the proposal, the timing, content, and format of reverse mortgage disclosures would be changed to make the disclosures more useful to consumers. Currently, consumers typically receive lengthy disclosures at the time they apply that do not explain the particular features unique to reverse mortgages. As proposed, however, consumers would receive disclosures on or with the application form, using simple language to highlight the basic features and risks of reverse mortgages. Shortly after filling out the application, consumers would receive transaction-specific disclosures that reflect the actual terms of the reverse mortgage being offered. In developing the proposal, the Board recognized that disclosures alone may not always be sufficient to protect consumers from unfair practices related to reverse mortgages. Reverse mortgages are complex products available to older consumers, some of whom may be more vulnerable to abusive practices. Concerns existed that some consumers, in order to obtain a reverse mortgage, have been forced to buy financial products that can be costly or may not be beneficial, such as annuities or long-term care insurance. Consequently, the proposal would address these concerns by prohibiting creditors from conditioning a reverse mortgage on the consumer's purchase of another financial or insurance product. Consumers would also be required to receive counseling about reverse mortgages before a creditor could impose nonrefundable fees or close the loan. D. Impact of the Dodd-Frank ActOn February 1, 2011, the Board announced that it did not expect to finalize the three pending mortgage disclosure rulemakings under TILA prior to the transfer of authority for such rulemakings to the Bureau. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, general rulemaking authority for TILA is scheduled to transfer to the Bureau on July 21, 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that the Bureau issue a proposal within 18 months after the designated transfer date to combine, in a single form, the mortgage disclosures required by TILA and the disclosures required by RESPA. In light of that mandate and the upcoming transfer date, the Board carefully evaluated whether there would be public benefit in proceeding with the disclosure rulemakings initiated with the Board's August 2009 and September 2010 proposals. Because the Board's 2009 and 2010 TILA proposals would substantially revise the disclosures for mortgage transactions, any new disclosures adopted by the Board would be subject to the Bureau's further revision in carrying out its mandate to combine the TILA and RESPA disclosures. In addition, a combined TILAâRESPA disclosure rule could well be proposed by the Bureau before any new disclosure requirements issued by the Board could be fully implemented by creditors. For these reasons, the Board determined that proceeding with the 2009 and 2010 proposals would not be in the public interest. Although there are specific provisions of these Board proposals that would not be affected by the Bureau's development of joint TILA-RESPA disclosures, adopting those portions of the Board's proposals in a piecemeal fashion would be of limited benefit, and the issuance of multiple rules with different implementation periods would create compliance difficulties. Accordingly, the Board did not finalize the August 2009 and September 2010 proposals, which will be transferred and become proposals of the Bureau. ConclusionThe Federal Reserve remains committed to carrying out its responsibilities for consumer protection, which will remain a priority for the Board notwithstanding the upcoming transfer of various rule-writing authorities to the Bureau. The Federal Reserve will retain a significant role in supervising financial institutions for compliance with both consumer protection regulations and the Community Reinvestment Act. During the mortgage crisis of the past few years, we have witnessed the importance of effective consumer protection in preserving not only the well-being of particular communities, but more importantly, of the economy as a whole. The effectiveness of consumer regulations depends critically on strong supervision and enforcement, and the Federal Reserve will continue to take seriously its responsibility in these areas.

This could occur because in a "creditor-pay" transaction, the loan originator cannot be paid on the basis of the loan's rate or other terms (except the amount of the loan), so the amount of compensation the loan originator may receive is fixed in advance and not negotiated with the consumer. However, this limitation does not apply in a "consumer-pay" transaction, where a loan originator can negotiate any compensation amount that the consumer will accept.

The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the appointment of David W. Wilcox as director of the Division of Research and Statistics, effective October 1. Wilcox, currently the deputy director of the division, will succeed David J. Stockton, who will retire on September 30 after 30 years of service with the Board, including 11 as division director. As director of the division, Wilcox will oversee the work of 325 employees and will be responsible for briefing the Federal Open Market Committee on the outlook for the U.S. economy. The Board's Division of Research and Statistics engages in economic analysis, forecasting, and research related to the domestic economy and financial markets. The division also conducts several major programs in economic measurement, including the Industrial Production and Flow of Funds programs and the Survey of Consumer Finances. In addition, it provides research and analysis in support of the Federal Reserve's financial stability responsibilities and supervisory and regulatory activities. "David Wilcox brings many years of exemplary public service--both at the Board and in other senior positions--to the position of division director. His economic interests are wide-ranging, and his expertise in topics relevant to the Federal Reserve is deep," said Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. Wilcox served on the Board staff from 1986 to 1997 in a variety of assignments spanning economic forecasting, economic measurement, monetary policy formulation, and other topics. During 1994 and 1995, he was detailed to serve on the staff of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. From 1997 to 2001, he served as assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department. Wilcox returned to the Board staff in 2001 as deputy director of the Division of Research and Statistics. He has published numerous papers and articles in the areas of monetary policy, fiscal policy, household spending and saving behavior, economic forecasting at the Federal Reserve, economic measurement, and defined-benefit pension plans. Wilcox received his B.A. in mathematics at Williams College in 1980 and his Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1987. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.
The Federal Reserve Board (Board) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Wednesday issued final rules to implement the credit score disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. If a credit score is used in setting material terms of credit or in taking adverse action, the statute requires creditors to disclose credit scores and related information to consumers in notices under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The final rules amend Regulation V (Fair Credit Reporting) to revise the content requirements for risk-based pricing notices, and to add related model forms that reflect the new credit score disclosure requirements. The Board is issuing these final rules jointly with the FTC. The final rules also amend certain model notices in Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity), which combine the adverse action notice requirements for Regulation B and the FCRA, to reflect the new credit score disclosure requirements The rules under Regulations V and B are effective 30 days after the date of publication in theFederal Register, which is expected soon.

On July 25, 2011, the Federal Reserve conducted an auction of $5 billion in 28-day term deposits through its Term Deposit Facility. Following are the results of the auction: Bids at the stop-out rate were pro-rated at 42.57 percent. Resulting awards were rounded to the nearest $10,000 except that all awards below $10,000 were rounded up to $10,000. The awarded deposits will settle on July 28, 2011, and will mature on August 25, 2011. The stop-out rate shown above will apply to all awarded deposits.
The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday issued a consent cease and desist order and assessed an $85 million civil money penalty against Wells Fargo & Company of San Francisco, a registered bank holding company, and Wells Fargo Financial, Inc., of Des Moines. The order addresses allegations that Wells Fargo Financial employees steered potential prime borrowers into more costly subprime loans and separately falsified income information in mortgage applications. In addition to the civil money penalty, the order requires that Wells Fargo compensate affected borrowers. The $85 million civil money penalty is the largest the Board has assessed in a consumer-protection enforcement action and is the first formal enforcement action taken by a federal bank regulatory agency to address alleged steering of borrowers into high-cost, subprime loans. Wells Fargo Financial--a once-active, non-bank subsidiary of Wells Fargo--made subprime loans that primarily refinanced existing home mortgages in which borrowers received additional money from the loan proceeds in so-called cash-out refinancing loans. The order addresses allegations that Wells Fargo Financial sales personnel steered borrowers who were potentially eligible for prime interest rate loans into loans at higher, subprime interest rates, resulting in greater costs to borrowers. The order also addresses separate allegations that Wells Fargo Financial sales personnel falsified information about borrowers' incomes to make it appear that the borrowers qualified for loans when they would not have qualified based on their actual incomes. These practices were allegedly fostered by Wells Fargo Financial's incentive compensation and sales quota programs and the lack of adequate controls to manage the risks resulting from these programs. These deficiencies allegedly constitute unsafe and unsound banking practices and unfair or deceptive acts or practices that are prohibited by the Federal Trade Commission Act and similar state laws. In agreeing to the order, Wells Fargo did not admit any wrongdoing. The order requires Wells Fargo to compensate borrowers affected by these practices. To identify prime-eligible borrowers with cash-out refinancing loans who were subject to improper steering, Wells Fargo is required to reevaluate the qualifications of all borrowers who took out a subprime, cash-out refinancing loan between January 2006 and June 2008 to account for certain specific steering techniques. To identify Wells Fargo Financial borrowers whose income information was falsified without their knowledge, Wells Fargo is required to set up a procedure for potentially affected borrowers to show that their actual income at the time did not qualify them for the loans they were granted. Wells Fargo is required to provide notice of this procedure to all borrowers who obtained cash-out refinancing loans between January 2004 and June 2008 at a Wells Fargo Financial office where there is evidence that sales personnel at that office altered or falsified borrowers' income information. These compensation plans must be approved by the Federal Reserve. An independent, third-party administrator will review determinations about the eligibility of individual borrowers for compensation and the amounts of compensation provided. The Federal Reserve will also monitor compliance with the approved plans. Failure to comply with the plans will constitute a breach of the cease and desist order. The amount of compensation provided to individual borrowers will depend on a number of factors, including differences between what borrowers paid and what they should have paid in terms of origination points, interest payments, fees, and penalties. Until specific determinations of harm to individual borrowers are made, it is difficult to determine the total amount of compensation provided to borrowers. Based on preliminary estimates, the amount of compensation that each eligible borrower will receive ranges between $1,000 and $20,000, but some eligible borrowers may receive less than $1,000 and others may receive more than $20,000. The number of borrowers who may receive compensation under both plans is estimated to be between 3,700 and possibly more than 10,000. Further information for borrowers may be found at www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage. In addition to the monetary components of the settlement, Wells Fargo is required to improve oversight of its anti-fraud and compliance programs and incentive compensation and performance management policies for personnel who sell and underwrite home mortgage loans. The Board also has issued consent orders against 16 former Wells Fargo Financial sales personnel prohibiting them from becoming employed in the banking industry. The Board has also issued a consent cease and desist order against another former Wells Fargo Financial sales person prohibiting future improper conduct. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.
The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the approval of a final rule to repeal its Regulation Q, which prohibits the payment of interest on demand deposits by institutions that are member banks of the Federal Reserve System. The final rule implements Section 627 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which repeals Section 19(i) of the Federal Reserve Act in its entirety effective July 21, 2011. The repeal of that section of the Federal Reserve Act on that date eliminates the statutory authority under which the Board established Regulation Q. The rule also repeals the Board's published interpretation of Regulation Q and removes references to Regulation Q found in the Board's other regulations, interpretations, and commentary. The Board's notice for the final rule is attached. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955. Federal Registernotice:HTML|PDF

The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday published lists of institutions that are subject to, and exempt from, the debit card interchange fee standards in Regulation II, which implements provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These lists, available at www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/debitfees.htm, are intended to help payment card networks and others determine which issuers qualify for the statutory exemption from interchange fee standards. The statute exempts any debit card issuer that, together with its affiliates, has assets of less than $10 billion. The interchange fee standards become effective on October 1, 2011. The Board plans to update the lists annually. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.
The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released a report that contains 2010 payment and account information about more than 1,000 agreements between institutions of higher education or affiliated organizations and credit card issuers. The Board also updated an online database that includes the full text of each agreement that was in effect during 2010. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (Credit CARD Act) requires issuers to submit to the Board annually their agreements with educational institutions or affiliated organizations, such as alumni associations. For each agreement, issuers are also required to submit information regarding payments made to the institution or organization and the number of accounts opened under the agreement. An online database,www.FederalReserve.gov/CollegeCreditCardAgreements, provides the complete text of each agreement and the payment and accounts information submitted by issuers. Users may also search for agreements by card issuer, by educational institution or organization, or by the city or state in which the institution or organization is located.

The Federal Reserve Board is seeking comment on a proposal that sets standards for banking organizations regulated by the Federal Reserve that engage in certain types of foreign exchange transactions with retail customers. The proposal, issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, outlines requirements for disclosure, recordkeeping, business conduct, and documentation for retail foreign exchange transactions. Institutions engaging in such transactions will be required to identify themselves to their regulator and to be well capitalized. They will also be required to collect margin for retail foreign exchange transactions. The types of transactions covered by the rule include off-exchange futures and options on futures, over-the-counter options on foreign currency, and so-called rolling spot transactions. The proposal does not include regular spot transactions, listed options on foreign currency, and foreign currency forwards and swaps. The proposal would cover entities regulated by the Federal Reserve including state member banks, bank and financial holding companies, Edge Act and agreement corporations, and uninsured state-licensed branches and agencies of foreign banks. The Federal Reserve consulted with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The agencies have engaged in separate rulemakings as specified by Dodd-Frank. The Federal Reserve requests comments on the proposal, which will be published soon in theFederal Register, by October 11, 2011. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

Statement for the Record Submitted to Subcommittees on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit and Oversight and Investigations, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. IntroductionChairman Capito, Chairman Neugebauer, Ranking Member Maloney, Ranking Member Capuano, and members of the Subcommittees, thank you for inviting the Federal Reserve Board to submit a statement for the record on the role of federal regulators in addressing the ongoing mortgage-servicing issues and the development of new national mortgage-servicing standards. This statement focuses on the results of the horizontal review of 14 large mortgage servicers conducted by the Federal Reserve Board and the other banking regulators in 2010, the enforcement orders that the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued as a result of those reviews, and the steps the Federal Reserve has taken in leading an interagency effort to develop new uniform national servicing and foreclosure-processing standards. Results of the Horizontal Servicer ReviewThe Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "agencies") completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 a review of mortgage servicing and foreclosure processing at 14 federally regulated mortgage servicers.1The review found critical weaknesses in foreclosure-governance practices, foreclosure-documentation processes, and oversight and monitoring of third-party law firms and other vendors. Moreover, on-site examiners found deficiencies in loan files, inadequate staffing and training, as well as an undue emphasis on quantitative production and timeliness instead of quality and adequate workload monitoring. The reviews revealed a need for substantial improvement in controls. The policies and procedures at many of the servicers were weak and needed expansion to provide effective monitoring of servicing activities. The reviews revealed heavy reliance on outsourcing arrangements with third party vendors without adequate oversight of these arrangements. Furthermore, internal audits and self assessments failed to identify specific weaknesses and process gaps. These weaknesses involved unsafe and unsound practices and violations of federal and state laws and demonstrated a pattern of misconduct and negligence. TheInteragency Review of Foreclosure Policies and Practices --issued in April 2011 by the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision -- provides a summary of the review findings and is attached. Enforcement ActionsBased on the findings from the review, the agencies issued enforcement actions by consent against the 14 mortgage servicers in April 2011 to address the significant deficiencies in mortgage-servicing and foreclosure practices.2The Federal Reserve also indicated, at the time the enforcement actions were issued, that it believes monetary sanctions in these cases are appropriate and plans to announce monetary penalties. The Federal Reserve and the other agencies noted that the deficiencies and weaknesses required immediate attention to ensure that customers are treated fairly and the servicers' processes are safe and sound as well as fully compliant with all applicable laws. The orders require the servicers, among other things, to: The Federal Reserve is monitoring, on an ongoing basis, the corrective measures that are being taken by the servicers and bank holding companies it supervises, as required by the enforcement actions. More specifically, at this time, the Federal Reserve is assessing the plans, programs, policies, procedures, and engagement letters that the servicers and bank holding companies must submit to implement those corrective measures and fully address the identified deficiencies, each of which must be approved by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve will closely monitor and review the servicers' and bank holding companies' progress to ensure that the plans are implemented as approved and to ensure that the changes are effective. Each servicer is also required to submit quarterly reports to the Federal Reserve detailing the measures it has taken to comply with the action and the results of those measures. The Federal Reserve will take appropriate supervisory action to address any inadequacies or violations of the enforcement actions. Although these enforcement actions do not expressly mandate loan modifications, the actions' "single-point-of-contact" requirements are designed to improve communications between the mortgage servicers and consumers in loss-mitigation and foreclosure. These requirements should also lead to less confusion among consumers about what they need to do to keep their homes. In addition, the improvements required by the enforcement actions will strengthen the integrity, fairness and legal compliance of the foreclosure process. Finally, the improvements that mortgage servicers make in their overall operations are expected to reduce legal uncertainty about foreclosures. All of these actions should lead to a more efficient loan modification process. It was necessary for the Federal Reserve Board and the other agencies to ensure that the serious deficiencies uncovered during the agencies' horizontal reviews were corrected promptly. This required immediate action by the agencies and is separate from the settlement discussions between the state Attorneys General and the largest servicers related to their servicing practices. The Department of Justice ("DOJ") is coordinating with the state Attorneys General toward a comprehensive solution to problems uncovered in the servicing of mortgage loans. The Federal Reserve Board is in close contact with the DOJ regarding those discussions. It is important to emphasize that the enforcement actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board complement the actions under consideration by the state Attorneys General and they do not preempt or preclude action by other federal or state agencies. Indeed, the enforcement actions specifically state, for example: "The provisions of this Order shall not bar, estop, or otherwise prevent the Board of Governors, the FDIC, the Reserve Bank, or any other federal or state agency from taking any further or other action â¦" National Servicing StandardsThe enforcement actions taken by the Federal Reserve and the other agencies apply only to the servicers subject to them. Another initiative, which is ongoing, is the inter-agency development of uniform national mortgage-servicing and foreclosure-processing standards that would apply to all servicers. The Federal Reserve Board, Treasury, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Housing Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Thrift Supervision and Federal Housing Finance Agency are collaborating to develop a set of uniform servicing standards for banks and other mortgage servicing organizations.3These standards are expected to address the proper handling of both performing and non-performing loans, including loss-mitigation procedures and foreclosure processing, and should lead to improved customer treatment and better transparency and oversight of mortgage servicers' processes. The intent of the initiative is to hold servicers to the same standards regardless of their regulator and regardless of whether the loans being serviced are held on the originator's books, have been sold, or have been securitized. By having a common set of standards for the mortgage-servicing industry, the financial regulatory agencies will support the adoption of servicing practices that promote the best interests of borrowers and the broader housing market. This initiative will also draw upon the findings of the horizontal review to systematically address the weaknesses that the review uncovered and the enforcement actions and their related action plans to guide proposals for specific standards. ConclusionThe Federal Reserve has taken a number of approaches towards mitigating the harm to consumers and to markets caused by problems in mortgage servicing and foreclosure processing. We will continue to monitor and assess the corrective actions taken by the servicers and the holding companies, as required by the enforcement actions, and take further action when necessary to address failures. The Federal Reserve Board's enforcement actions will remain in place until weaknesses and deficiencies have been corrected. Likewise, the Federal Reserve Board will remain in close contact with the DOJ regarding the settlement discussions between the state Attorneys General and the largest servicers. Additionally, the Board supports the development of a uniform set of national mortgage-servicing and foreclosure-processing standards to promote accountability and appropriate practices in dealing with consumers.

Mark E. Van Der Weide, Senior Associate Director, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation Before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. Chairman Neugebauer, Ranking Member Capuano, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). To help achieve the important objective of reducing governmental and private sector reliance on credit ratings, section 939A requires all federal agencies to review their regulations for references and requirements related to credit ratings, remove such credit rating references and requirements from their regulations, and replace them with appropriate alternative standards of creditworthiness. In my testimony, I will first describe how the Board has used credit ratings in its regulations. I will then discuss the problems associated with credit ratings that were observed during the recent financial crisis and how section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act attempts to address those problems. Lastly, I will discuss the most important considerations in developing alternative standards of creditworthiness and describe the Board's efforts to develop these standards. A credit rating is an assessment by a third-party rating firm of the credit risk of a financial instrument--that is, whether the issuer of the instrument (the borrower) will meet its contractual obligations to pay principal and interest to the holder of the instrument (the creditor). As detailed in the report the Board submitted to the Congress last week, in accordance with section 939A,1the Board has reviewed its regulations for references to and requirements regarding the use of credit ratings. In all, we identified 46 references to or requirements regarding credit ratings in our regulations. Most of these references to credit ratings are in the Board's risk-based capital rules for state member banks and bank holding companies. For example, under the Board's risk-based capital rules, a banking firm's capital requirements for certain securitization positions and trading positions are in whole or in part a function of the position's credit rating.2Other references appear in regulations governing transactions between banks and their affiliates, in regulations on international banking operations, and in regulations governing state member bank investments in financial subsidiaries. For example, whether a foreign branch of a U.S.bank may invest in a foreign government debt obligation may depend on the credit rating of the obligation.3 For many years before the introduction of credit ratings in banking regulations, investors had used credit ratings to assist them in making investment decisions. Credit ratings provided a uniform, market-driven, third-party assessment of the creditworthiness of countries, state and local governments, and companies. Federal agencies later incorporated credit ratings into their regulatory frameworks in part because of these same positive attributes. The recent financial crisis, however, made manifest serious flaws associated with the methodologies and processes used to determine credit ratings, particularly ratings for structured finance positions. For example, the rating agencies used untested models that were revealed to be based on flawed assumptions and that relied on limited and unverified data about underlying asset pools to predict default frequencies of structured finance positions. The rating agencies also provided insufficient transparency to market participants about those models and about how their ratings of structured finance positions differed from ratings of unstructured debt. In addition, the rating agencies suffered from potential conflicts of interest due to their "issuer pays" compensation arrangements and other factors. These flaws contributed to the issuance of credit ratings that severely underestimated the credit risk of many mortgage- and asset-backed securities. Investors, for their part, relied too heavily and uncritically on these ratings in making investment decisions. Indeed, downward revaluations of many of these securities by market participants between 2007 and 2009, and the resulting loss of confidence in the accuracy of credit ratings, contributed meaningfully to the destabilizing dynamics of the recent financial crisis. Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act is one of a number of provisions in title IX of the statute intended to address the various problems associated with credit ratings and the rating agencies that became evident during the crisis. Section 939A was intended to help address these problems by removing credit ratings from federal regulations, thereby helping eliminate any government-induced demand for, and reliance on, ratings. In place of ratings, under section939A, the Board (and each other federal agency) generally must substitute appropriate alternative standards of creditworthiness that are as uniform as possible. The level of difficulty associated with removing credit ratings from the Board's regulations varies considerably from regulation to regulation. Complete removal of credit ratings from the Board's risk-based capital rules for banking firms poses the greatest challenge. To protect the safety and soundness of individual banking firms and of financial stability more broadly, we are striving to develop alternative standards of creditworthiness for use in our risk-based capital rules that possess the virtues of credit ratings but not the vices. There are several key characteristics of a good alternative creditworthiness standard. Most importantly, the standard should be reliably risk-sensitive; it should effectively measure the relative credit risk of various types of financial instruments and counterparties. Reducing the risk sensitivity of the risk-based capital rules would make a banking firm's risk-based capital ratios less informative of the firm's capital adequacy and would make the capital rules easier to arbitrage. In addition, the standard should result in a consistent and transparent application across different types of financial instruments and counterparties. Moreover, the standard ideally should auto-adjust on a timely basis to reflect changes in the credit-risk profile of an instrument or counterparty and should auto-adapt to cover new financial market practices. Finally, the standard should be relatively simple to implement and should not increase the regulatory burden for banking firms, especially small banks. Obviously, credit ratings themselves do not meet all these criteria, and developing good replacements for credit ratings is a particularly difficult task. Since the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law last July, the Board has been working with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to carry out the 939A mandate. To further this effort, in August2010, the Board and the other banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting public comment on alternative standards of creditworthiness to be used in the risk-based capital rules. In addition, in November 2010, the Board hosted a roundtable discussion with the other banking agencies, academics, and industry experts to solicit views on how to replace credit ratings in our capital rules. Public commenters on our 939A efforts have expressed concern about the statutory mandate of section 939A and have suggested it could lead to competitive distortions across the global banking system and the domestic banking landscape. Most commenters have emphasized the need for alternative standards of creditworthiness to be risk-sensitive. In addition, commenters representing less complex banking firms have indicated that any alternative standard should be reasonably easy to implement, should allow banks of varying size and complexity to arrive at the same assessment of creditworthiness for similar exposures, and should take into account the costs and burdens imposed on small firms. We are particularly sensitive to the difficulties of constructing effective, low-burden replacement standards for smaller banks, which have less credit-risk assessment resources than large banks. The Board continues to work closely with the other banking agencies to develop appropriate alternative standards for banking firms to use to meet regulatory requirements for assessing the credit risk of financial instruments and counterparties. We are considering a number of approaches, including approaches that rely on market-based indicators, such as bond spreads; approaches that rely on balance-sheet financial ratios; and approaches that rely on internal assessments of credit risk by banking firms. Each of these approaches, like the use of credit ratings, has strengths and weaknesses. The Board anticipates that it will propose amendments to remove references to credit ratings from its regulations in the near future, including through proposals to implement recent international agreements on capital by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Board also has been active in the international efforts to encourage reduced dependence on credit ratings across the global financial system. Such efforts include the development and publication of principles by the Financial Stability Board in 2010 for reducing reliance on credit ratings by supervisors and market participants as well as work that is currently being conducted by the Basel Committee to revise the Basel capital framework to reduce reliance on ratings.4Although the international financial regulatory community is working to reduce reliance on credit ratings, the Basel capital framework (including several components of the recent Basel III agreement) continues to incorporate credit ratings in material ways. Accordingly, we will need to find ways to synchronize our 939A changes with the global bank-capital accords. The Board welcomes input from the public and from members of the Subcommittee on this important issue of public policy. Thank you for the opportunity to describe the Board's efforts to date to implement section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act. I am happy to answer any questions. 1.See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011),Report to the Congress on Credit Ratings (235 KB PDF)(Washington: Board of Governors, July).Return to text 2.See 12 CFR parts 208 and 225, Appendix A, §III, and Appendix E.Return to text 3.See 12 CFR 211.4.Return to text 4.See Financial Stability Board (2010),Principals for Reducing Reliance on CRA Ratings(134 KB PDF)(Basel, Switzerland: Financial Stability Board, October).Return to text
