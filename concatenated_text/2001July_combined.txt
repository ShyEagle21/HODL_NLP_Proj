Testimony of Dolores S. Smith Director, Division of Consumer and Community Affairs The Consumer Rental Purchase Agreement Act (H.R. 1701) Before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Committee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives July 12, 2001 I appreciate the opportunity to appear before this subcommittee to offer staff comments on H.R. 1701, the Consumer Rental Purchase Agreement Act, which would amend the Consumer Credit Protection Act. I am the director of the Federal Reserve Boardï¿½s Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, which carries out the Boardï¿½s responsibilities for administering a number of the consumer protection laws that make up the Consumer Credit Protection Act, including the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act. H.R. 1701 would require cost disclosures for ï¿½rental-purchaseï¿½ agreements, which are also known as ï¿½rent-to-ownï¿½ transactions. The bill has substantive provisions. For example, it establishes consumersï¿½ right to reinstate an agreement after failing to make a timely payment. The bill also would prohibit certain provisions in rental-purchase contracts, such as confession-of-judgment clauses that prevent consumers from defending any legal action brought under the contract. H.R. 1701 treats rent-to-own transactions differently from both credit sales and traditional leases and would, therefore, cover them under a separate regulatory scheme altogether. The Federal Reserve Board has not taken a position on H.R. 1701. However, I am glad to share the Board staffï¿½s observationsï¿½about the bill and some of the issues raisedï¿½in response to your request. Rental-purchase transactions involve short-term, renewable rentals of personal property, typically on a week-to-week or month-to-month basis. For example, a consumer may rent a television set, major household appliances such as a washing machine or refrigerator, or home furnishings such as living room furniture. By renewing the rental from one period to the next, a consumer can ultimately purchase the item after making a specified number of payments, but the consumer is not obligated to do so. Rental-purchase transactions typically are for less than four months initiallyï¿½although they often extend for longer periods. These agreements are not covered by the disclosure requirements of the federal Consumer Leasing Act, which applies to leases that initially exceed four months. Nor are these transactions generally credit sales for purposes of Truth in Lending Act disclosures. Contracts in the form of a lease are treated as credit under Truth in Lending only if the consumer is obligated to purchase the property and pay an amount equal to or exceeding the total value of the property; such an obligation does not typically exist in rent-to-own transactions. Under the Consumer Leasing Act, consumers receive federally mandated disclosures concerning the cost of the transaction prior to entering into the lease. These disclosures include a description of the leased property, an itemization of any up-front payments, a payment schedule showing the amount of each periodic (typically monthly) payment, a listing of any other charges the consumer will have to pay, and the total of payments that the consumer will have paid by the end of the lease. There are also disclosures regarding early termination charges, late payment fees, property maintenance responsibilities, and the consumerï¿½s options for purchasing the property. Under the Truth in Lending Act, consumers must receive disclosure of the key costs and terms of credit transactions before they become obligated for the extension of credit. Consumers receive disclosures that include the amount of credit extended (known as the amount financed), the cost of credit expressed as a dollar amount (the finance charge) and as an annual percentage rate (APR), the total amount the consumer will pay, and a payment schedule showing the timing and amount of each payment. Assessing the Need for Legislation While, currently, there is no federal regulation of rental-purchase transactions, laws governing these transactions have been adopted in forty-seven states. These laws were enacted largely with the support of the industry. All of the state laws have been enacted since 1984 (twenty-four of them since 1990). In the early 1980s, before any action was taken at the state level, representatives of the rental-purchase industry supported federal legislation to cover these transactions. For firms operating in multiple states, a uniform regulatory framework eases the compliance costs. At the time, federal legislation was also advocated by the industry to clarify that rental-purchase transactions are leases under the tax laws, and to preclude states from applying their credit laws and usury limits to these transactions. The subsequent enactment of state laws and other legal developments may have settled these issues to some extent. In the early 1980s, some consumer advocates also favored federal legislation covering rental-purchase transactions, because of the lack of state law consumer protections. Since the mid-to-late 1980s, however, consumer advocates have generally objected to legislation proposed at the federal level for several reasonsï¿½because they believe the federal proposals provided insufficient consumer protections; because federal legislation might have preempted state laws that they viewed as more protective; and, in the case of some consumer advocates, because they continued to view rent-to-own transactions as credit sales under the Truth in Lending Act. Given the existing body of state law, the subcommittee is to be commended for holding these hearings to exploreï¿½with industry representatives and consumer advocatesï¿½the need for federal legislation. The views of the state agencies charged with administering and enforcing the applicable state laws should also be helpful in this process. Much can be learned, for example, about the effectiveness and adequacy of the existing state laws and the statesï¿½ experience in enforcing them. I expect you will find the Federal Trade Commissionï¿½s survey on the rent-to-own industry particularly useful in identifying and discussing relevant issues. The FTC report on its survey of rent-to-own customers has been a primaryï¿½and importantï¿½source of information for the Board staffï¿½s consideration of these issues. Effective Disclosures Several provisions of H.R. 1701 focus on consumer disclosures in advertising, on price tags, in catalogues, and in contracts. Disclosures are most effective when consumers receive them early enough in the process to use them as a shopping tool, and when the disclosures are presented in a way that enables consumers to focus on the key costs and terms. We also offer the general observation that, while disclosure is important, too much information can sometimes obscure the basic, key information consumers may need to make an informed choice. The fact that rent-to-own transactions have characteristics of both sales and leases is important to consider in determining what disclosures consumers need. Although there may be some disagreement about the purchase rate for rent-to-own merchandise, the percentage of purchases by customers who enter into these transactions appears to be substantial. The FTCï¿½s survey found that about seventy percent of rent-to-own merchandise was purchased by consumers. But as the FTC report also notes, industry sources have consistently maintained that the purchase rate is considerably lower, about twenty-five to thirty percent. Under H.R. 1701, key cost disclosures must be provided on merchandise tags or labels for property that is displayed or offered in a dealerï¿½s place of business. As the bill recognizes, such disclosures could be a useful shopping tool for consumers. Only eighteen states currently require merchandise disclosures, so this is one aspect in which federal law could directly enhance state-law protections, although some firms may voluntarily be providing these disclosures. As to the content of merchandise tags, we concur with the FTC reportï¿½s assessment about disclosure of total cost for purposes of comparison shopping. Because many customers may end up purchasing the property, merchandise tags and labels should show the total cost to purchase the item, as provided in H.R. 1701, and not just the rental fee. Of the states that require merchandise tags, all but a few require inclusion of the total purchase price. Consumers could use the total purchase cost disclosure while shopping, to compare the dealerï¿½s purchase price with the prices offered by other rent-to-own dealers. In addition to the total rental-purchase cost, H.R. 1701 would require merchants also to disclose a ï¿½cash priceï¿½ for the property covered by the rental-purchase agreement. This disclosure would enable consumers to compare the cash price from a rent-to-own dealer with the sale prices at traditional retail stores. In making this comparison, a consumer could judge whether the rent-to-own dealerï¿½s cash price is reasonable for the goods and services being provided, and they can look at the difference between the dealerï¿½s cash price and the total purchase price under the rental-purchase agreement. H.R. 1701 also requires that more detailed disclosures be made in connection with the rental-purchase agreement, at or before the date of consummation. Most of the cost disclosures would have to be grouped together and segregated from other information. Disclosures about other terms and conditions must be clearly and conspicuously included in the rental-purchase agreement. This segregation is consistent with the approach used in the Consumer Leasing Act and Truth in Lending Act, and is an approach that we believe is effective in calling the consumerï¿½s attention to the most important terms. The Standard for Preemption of State Laws You asked us to comment on the impact of H.R. 1701 on state law. A bill establishing federal minimum standards for consumer disclosures in rental-purchase transactions may offer some benefits to consumers and to the industry. The effect of any federal legislation on the ability of states to retain more protective statutory provisions, or adopt new consumer protections, should also be taken into account. H.R. 1701 would amend the Consumer Credit Protection Act. But as drafted, the bill applies a standard for preemption that differs from the standard used under other titles of the Act. Under the existing federal statutes, a specific provision in state law is generally preempted only to the extent that the state provision is inconsistent with the federal statute. H.R. 1701 contains this language but omits other language used in the Consumer Credit Protection Act statutes. The omitted language provides that a state law is not inconsistent with the federal statute if it is found to give greater protection to the consumer. The preemption provisions in H.R. 1701 would expressly preclude states from requiring an APR disclosure or subjecting rental-purchase transactions to state credit laws, including usury limits. It is not clear whether the preemption provisions in H.R. 1701 are intended to limit the statesï¿½ ability to retain (or adopt) more protective rules on other aspects of rent-to-own transactions. For example, some states mandate longer reinstatement periods than the periods specified in H.R. 1701. The effect on these laws should be clarified. Rulewriting Authority You also have asked us to comment on whether the FTC or the Federal Reserve should write the regulations implementing H.R. 1701, and who should be responsible for enforcing these regulations. As drafted, the bill currently gives rulewriting authority to the Federal Reserve Board. We strongly urge that further thought be given to whether the Federal Reserve is the appropriate agency to regulate these transactions. The Federal Reserve has no supervisory relationship with rent-to-own dealers, which are firms that are not generally subject to Board regulations governing financial services. These transactions are not covered by the existing credit or leasing regulations, and hence the Boardï¿½s staff has no direct experience with industry practices and how rental-purchase transactions are conducted. We believe the Federal Trade Commissionï¿½s experience in regulating the trade practices of commercial firms makes that agency the more logical choice for writing regulations. As H.R. 1701 recognizes, the FTC is the most appropriate agency for purposes of enforcement because it is the principal agency charged with enforcing the Consumer Credit Protection Act with respect to companies that are not depository institutions. The Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies have enforcement authority under that act only with respect to the depository institutions they supervise.
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System New York State Banking Department For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Banking Department today announced the joint issuance of a combined consent Order to Cease and Desist and an Assessment of a Civil Money Penalty and Monetary Payment against U.S. Trust Corporation, a bank holding company, and its subsidiary, the United States Trust Company of New York, a state-chartered bank. U.S. Trust Corporation and the United States Trust Company of New York, without admitting to any allegations, consented to the issuance of the Order in connection with alleged violations and deficiencies relating to the lack of internal controls and procedures and inadequate compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and relating to the failure to maintain accurate and complete books and records in connection with the operations and activities of the Strategic Trading Group of the bank. U.S. Trust Corporation and the United States Trust Company of New York are paying to the Board a civil money penalty in the amount of $5 million and are making a $5 million monetary payment to the State of New York. A copy of the Order is attached.

Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action.
Remarks by Governor Laurence H. Meyer At the University of California at San Diego Economics Roundtable, San Diego, California July 17, 2001 Inflation Targets and Inflation Targeting There is widespread agreement that price stability (in practice, low and stable inflation) should be an objective of monetary policy. This agreement is reflected both in the mandates set for monetary policy by governments and in the practice of central banks. Several other important questions about the objectives for monetary policy are less settled: Should there be other objectives? If there are multiple objectives, should one of the objectives take priority? And how explicit should the objectives be? Central banks typically operate under one of two types of mandate. A hierarchical mandate makes price stability the primary objective for monetary policy and subordinates other potential objectives. A dual mandate recognizes two objectives--price stability and full employment--and puts them on an equal footing. Either regime could make the price stability objective more precise by setting an explicit numerical target for inflation. Thus we can describe a typical central bank's mandate and objectives in terms of two sets of alternatives: between a hierarchical or a dual mandate, on the one hand, and an implicit or explicit inflation objective, on the other hand. During the 1990s, a number of central banks adopted a framework that is called inflation targeting, combining a hierarchical mandate and an explicit inflation objective. The United States, in contrast, combines a dual mandate and an implicit inflation objective. Most of the discussion in the United States on the subject of mandates and objectives has been about whether to identify inflation as the single or primary objective and whether to move to a formal inflation-targeting regime. The title of my lecture--"Inflation Targets and Inflation Targeting"--is intended to differentiate between two options for changing the policy mandate for the Federal Reserve. The first option, which I favor, is setting an explicit numerical target for inflation within the context of our current dual mandate. The second option, which I do not favor, is moving to an inflation-targeting regime, that is, also substituting a hierarchical mandate for our current dual mandate. The purpose of this lecture is therefore to explain the benefits of an explicit inflation target in the context of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate and to set out the operational steps for implementing such a target. Before proceeding, let me note that the views that I am presenting here are my own. I am not speaking for the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I. The Evolution of Monetary Policy Mandates A good starting point is a survey of mandates around the world. I will begin by discussing the evolution of the mandate in the United States, including the precise language related to the dual mandate, the way in which the price stability objective has been interpreted, and proposed legislation that would have amended the mandate. Then I sketch an inflation-targeting regime and discuss some common elements and differences among the inflation-targeting regimes of developed economies around the world. A. The Evolution of Policy Objectives in the United States In the United States, it took quite some time for the Congress to establish a precise set of objectives for monetary policy. In fact, remarkably little about policy objectives was included in the original Federal Reserve Act in 1913. The only policy objectives of the Fed, as identified in that statute, were "to furnish an elastic currency [and] to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper." The absence of any mention of price stability undoubtedly reflected confidence that the gold standard, under which the United States was operating, would promote price stability. The intent of providing an elastic currency and of rediscounting commercial paper was to expand the supply of money and credit to accommodate expansions in production and the accompanying demand for credit. Given that the immediate impetus of the founding of the Federal Reserve was the Panic of 1907, promoting financial stability was a clear focus. The framers' intention was that the Federal Reserve would provide banks with a source of liquidity through rediscounting to meet deposit withdrawals. On several occasions during the 1920s and 1930s, the Congress debated a price-stability objective for the Fed. The Fed opposed such a mandate and it was not adopted. Congress did take a step toward a more explicit treatment of policy objectives in the Employment Act of 1946. This act identified the objectives for the government in general, but not specifically for the Fed. Still, the act was generally viewed as applying to the Fed, as a part of government. The objectives identified in the act were "to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power." Although this set of objectives could be interpreted as including both full employment and price stability, the title of the bill and the specific language suggests that the priority at the time was more to maintain full employment than to promote price stability. Such a focus on stabilizing employment and a relative inattention to inflation was perhaps an understandable reaction to the Great Depression when, for a decade, high unemployment and falling prices were the major problems facing the U.S. economy. The specific mandate for the Federal Reserve was first added to the Federal Reserve Act in 1977, although that same language had been included in a 1975 concurrent resolution of the Congress. The 1977 amendment required the Board of Governors and the FOMC to "maintain the growth of monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long-run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates." This language makes the objective of price stability explicit. Because the Fed can contribute to moderate long-term interest rates principally by achieving low and stable inflation, that objective is generally not viewed as an independent one. In addition, the goal of maximum employment is usually interpreted as maximum sustainable employment--meaning the highest level of employment that can be maintained without upward pressure on inflation. The mandate is therefore interpreted as a dual mandate: full employment and price stability. The Federal Reserve has not set an explicit, numerical objective for inflation. Paul Volcker offered the following definition of price stability in 1983: A workable definition of reasonable "price stability" would seem to me to be a situation in which expectations of generally rising (or falling) prices over a considerable period are not a pervasive influence on economic and financial behavior. Stated more positively, "stability" would imply that decisionmaking should be able to proceed on the basis that "real" and "nominal" values are substantially the same over the planning horizon--and that planning horizons should be suitably long. Alan Greenspan has described the price stability objective in a similar way: We will be at price stability when households and businesses need not factor expectations of changes in the average level of prices into their decisions. These definitions make clear a commitment to low inflation. But they leave open whether, for example, the inflation rate prevailing today--about 2-1/2 percent for the core consumer price index (CPI) measure of consumer prices--is consistent with this definition. Is policy going to be set to lower inflation over time, and if so, by how much? These definitions also leave open the possibility of changing interpretations as the FOMC membership changes over time. The Fed often prefers to state its objective without specifically mentioning price stability. This is perhaps because the emphasis on price stability is taken by some as carrying a hint of restrictive policy and as an inclination to always be leaning against cyclical increases in demand. The Fed sometimes prefers to state its objective simply as promoting maximum sustainable growth. Stating its objective in this way allows the Fed to offer a more positive message and leaves implicit the price stability objective in two ways. First, if the economy were to grow above a sustainable rate for long enough, overheating and higher inflation would eventually follow. Second, price stability contributes to a high and perhaps faster rate of growth in productive capacity, a point I will return to below. Nevertheless, I prefer to state the Fed's objectives as full employment and price stability. In my view, the Fed has no growth objective. At full employment, the rate of growth will automatically be the maximum sustainable rate the economy is capable of achieving and a rate largely independent of monetary policy, except insofar as monetary policy is successful in achieving price stability. In recent years, bills have been introduced on a few occasions that would have made price stability the sole or primary objective for monetary policy and required the Fed to set an explicit numerical inflation target. In 1989, 1991, and 1993, Representative Steve Neal, Chairman of the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy, introduced resolutions instructing the Federal Reserve "to adopt and pursue monetary policies leading to, and then maintaining, zero inflation." In the 1991 and 1993 versions, zero inflation was defined as "when the expected rate of change of the general level of prices ceases to be a factor in individual and business decisionmaking." While these resolutions did not pass, the definition of price stability in the 1991 and 1993 resolutions was, undoubtedly not by accident, nearly identical to the language used by Chairman Greenspan and to the concept articulated earlier by Chairman Volcker. A second set of bills was introduced by Senator Connie Mack and Representative Jim Saxton in 1995 and 1997. These bills instructed the Fed to set an explicit numerical definition of price stability and to "maintain a monetary policy that effectively promotes long-term price stability." Representative Saxton introduced a significantly revised version of these bills in 1997 and 1999, mandating price stability as the "primary goal" of the Federal Reserve and requiring the Fed to establish an explicit numerical definition of inflation. Senator Mack reintroduced his version in 1999. I interpret these bills as attempts to push the United States toward a full inflation-targeting regime. Indeed, the Mack versions would establish an inflation-targeting regime among the strictest in the world, given that it would have established price stability as the sole objective of monetary policy, not simply a hierarchical set of objectives. The Saxton version is more in line with hierarchical mandates employed in many inflation-targeting regimes. These bills were, therefore, vigorously opposed by advocates of the dual mandate. Perhaps because these bills formed the backdrop to the debate in the United States about the policy mandate, little discussion has taken place on the merits of moving to an explicit numerical inflation target in the context of the prevailing dual mandate. Of course, another explanation for the lack of debate is that few are unhappy with macroeconomic performance under the current regime. B. Mandates in Inflation-Targeting Regimes New Zealand in 1990 became the first country to establish a formal inflation-targeting regime. Canada followed in 1991, the United Kingdom in 1992, and Australia and Sweden in 1993. Subsequently, Finland and Spain adopted inflation targeting (before becoming members of the European Monetary Union) and in the last few years several developing countries have adopted this approach. Although the European Central Bank does not identify itself as an inflation-targeting regime, the Maastricht Treaty set price stability as the ECB's primary objective and the ECB has set an explicit numerical target for inflation. What Is an Inflation-Targeting Regime? Inflation-targeting regimes generally identify price stability as the primary objective, usually in the context of a hierarchical mandate. They set an explicit numerical target for inflation and set a period over which any deviation of inflation from its target is to be eliminated, although some regimes provide escape clauses and other flexibility related to the pace of return to price stability. The inflation target is sometimes set as a point and sometimes as a range. In most cases, the inflation objective is set for a measure of overall consumer price inflation, the point or midpoint of the ranges is generally around 2 percent, and the ranges (where employed) are generally 2 percentage points wide--typically 1 percent to 3 percent. The time period prescribed for return to the inflation target following departures is sometimes explicit and sometimes not, generally in the range of eighteen months to two years. Examples of Inflation-Targeting Regimes In New Zealand, the first inflation-targeting regime, the numerical target is set jointly by the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the central bank and is currently a range of 0 percent to 3 percent, the widest of any of the ranges in inflation-targeting regimes. New Zealand is quite well-known for establishing performance contracts for government officials, and this approach is followed in the law governing the operation of the central bank: The statute allows the governor to be dismissed if inflation performance is inadequate. The Bank of Canada operates under the vaguest legal mandate among inflation-targeting central banks. Its statute requires it to regulate "credit and currency in the best interests of the economic life of the nation." Despite the absence of a precise legal mandate, the details of the Bank's monetary policy objectives are reached by agreement between the Bank and the Department of Finance. This agreement has set price stability as the principal objective for monetary policy. To implement this objective, the agreement sets the range for inflation as 1 percent to 3 percent and identifies the midpoint as the explicit target. The Reserve Bank of Australia has a mandate most closely resembling ours, though it is even broader and more open-ended. Their legislative mandate is "to [promote] stability of the currency of Australia;ï¿½[maintain] full employment in Australia; andï¿½[foster] economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia." The explicit inflation target, 2 percent to 3 percent, is set by the central bank and applies to the average inflation rate over a business cycle. Although Australia is counted among inflation-targeting countries, it has a dual mandate rather than a hierarchical one. Indeed, it is a model for the combination I prefer: an explicit inflation target within a dual mandate. The mandate in the United Kingdom is hierarchical. Article 11 of the Bank of England Act sets the objectives for monetary policy as "to maintain price stability" and "subject to that, to support the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment." The explicit target, set by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the equivalent of the Minister of Finance in many countries or the Secretary of the Treasury in the United States), is currently 2.5 percent and the target is for retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments. The Governor of the Bank of England must write a letter to the Chancellor if inflation deviates by more than 1 percentage point from the target. The ECB does not view itself as an inflation-targeting central bank. However, the Maastricht Treaty--the equivalent of the statute establishing the objectives for a central bank--identifies price stability as the principal objective in the context of a hierarchical mandate. Article 105 of the Maastricht Treaty states that "the primary objective of the [European System of Central Banks (ESCB)] shall be to maintain price stability. Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the community with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Community laid down in Article 2." The objectives mentioned in Article 2 include "sustainable and non-inflationary growth," a "high level of employment," and "raising the standard of living" among member states. The ECB's Governing Council sets the explicit numerical inflation target. This is currently set with an explicit ceiling of 2 percent and an implicit lower bound of 0 percent. This is the case of a range rather than a point, with no preference stated for the midpoint. The Evolution of Inflation-Targeting Regimes Over their short history, inflation-targeting regimes have evolved to give central banks greater flexibility in conducting monetary policy. Mervyn King calls regimes which take no account of output gaps (where the coefficient on the output gap is zero in the loss function) "inflation nutters." That language suggests that entirely ignoring output stabilization is now viewed as an extreme position and not as a desirable option for central banks. Lars Svensson argues that there has, in fact, been a convergence toward "flexible inflation targeting"--meaning inflation-targeting regimes that in practice take into account deviations in both output and inflation from their respective targets. Such an evolution has brought many inflation-targeting regimes closer in practice to a dual mandate regime. II. The Case for a Dual Mandate The appropriate goals for monetary policy depend on the structure of the economy and the preferences of the citizenry. My support for a dual mandate reflects my views about the structure of the economy and about the public's preferences. These can be summarized as follows: Low and stable inflation ("price stability") is essential to good macroeconomic performance and hence should be an objective of macroeconomic policy. The central bank is uniquely responsible for the inflation rate in the long run. Monetary policy can make some contribution to lowering the variability of output relative to potential. The public desires both low and stable inflation and a low variability of output relative to potential. The first two points, of course, are shared by most central bank mandates. The case for the dual mandate includes the third and fourth points. Price Stability as a Policy Objective As I noted at the outset, it is widely agreed that low and stable inflation is desirable. Several costs of high and variable inflation have been identified. These costs typically arise from distortions in economic decisionmaking arising from high or variable inflation rates and result in lower levels of output than would otherwise be the case. I won't elaborate in detail about these costs here, because I take as a starting point the agreement that price stability is an important, if not the singular objective for monetary policy. But the key point is that price stability is not an end in itself; it is important because it contributes to a higher level of output and perhaps faster growth in output. Monetary Policy and Inflation Few economists would disagree that inflation is, as Milton Friedman taught us long ago, always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. This was earlier interpreted as a statement about a tight relationship between money growth (controlled by the central bank) and inflation. Today, it is recognized that even if the relationship between money growth and inflation has weakened, perhaps because of financial innovations, central banks can achieve their inflation targets by adjusting their preferred instrument, typically some short-term interest rate. Hence, monetary policy still determines the rate of inflation in the long run. While it is also well understood that supply shocks--such as abrupt changes in the price of energy or food unrelated to the overall balance between aggregate demand and supply--can result in short-run changes in inflation, such changes in inflation can persist only if central banks accommodate them. Central banks therefore must accept full responsibility for inflation in the long run and have the tools to achieve price stability. The Ability to Stabilize Output While monetary policy can achieve a long-run inflation target, economic theory suggests that it cannot affect the level of output or its growth rate in the long run, other than by maintaining low and stable inflation. Therefore, the objective of price stability should be assigned to monetary policymakers, but the objective of high and rising living standards should not be. On the other hand, the Congress and the Administration have many opportunities to affect the level and growth in potential output--including the size of the structural budget deficit relative to output, the details of the tax code, and the composition of government spending. Whether central banks should accept responsibility for stabilizing output relative to potential is more controversial. Milton Friedman, for example, has always questioned the ability of central banks to stabilize output relative to potential and worried that attempting to do so could be counterproductive, given the "long and variable lags" between policy actions and the economic effects. Economists agree that monetary policy cannot "fine tune" the economy to ensure that the full employment objective is continuously maintained. However, a considerable amount of research supports the contention that monetary policy can reduce the variability of output around its full-employment level. Preferences Households and businesses are presumed to prefer low and stable inflation to high and variable inflation. But they also prefer high and rising real income per capita and output that is consistently close to the economy's maximum sustainable level of output. This is often expressed in terms of a loss function where the loss to society is expressed as a weighted average of squared deviations of inflation from its target and of output from its potential level. The squaring of the deviations ensures that deviations on either side of the target are treated equivalently as losses. The weights, a and 1- a , indicate the relative intensity of the public's distaste for deviating from their preferred rates of inflation and output. The loss to society, L, can be expressed as (1) L = a ( p - p *) 2 + (1- a ) ( y - y *) 2 where p is the rate of inflation, p * is the target rate of inflation, y is the level of output and y * is the target level of output or potential output. Tradeoff between Inflation and Output Variability Although it is possible in principle to achieve price stability and full employment simultaneously, an inevitable tradeoff between the variability of output and the variability of inflation exists. This tradeoff is most obvious in the case of a supply shock, for example an abrupt increase in the price of oil. An adverse supply shock typically raises inflation and lowers aggregate demand (by reducing the purchasing power of consumers), thereby moving inflation up and output down. This gives rise to a well-known dilemma for monetary policy: Should monetary policy ease to reduce the decline in output or tighten to counter the rise in inflation? The structure of the economy is such that the quicker monetary policy tries to return inflation to its target (to reduce the variability of inflation), the greater the variability in output. The choice of a hierarchical versus a dual mandate may be the most important consideration determining where a country ends up along this tradeoff. That is, countries with hierarchical mandates are more likely to end up with lower inflation variability at the expense of higher output variability. A dual mandate, therefore, provides flexibility for the central bank to select the point along this tradeoff that matches the public's preference. Focusing Policymakers on What They Can Achieve An argument often made for a hierarchical mandate is that identifying price stability as the sole or primary objective focuses monetary policy on what it can achieve and, thereby, reduces political pressure to pursue goals that are not achievable. To be sure, wide agreement exists that central banks can achieve low and stable inflation and should be held accountable for doing so. There is also agreement that central banks cannot raise the level or growth of potential output (other than through achieving their price stability objective) and should therefore not be held accountable for these dimensions of macroeconomic performance. But the public also cares about the variability of output relative to potential, and the conduct of monetary policy inevitably will affect output variability. Therefore, in my view, the importance of keeping monetary policy focused on what it can do supports the case for a dual mandate that explicitly recognizes both price stability and output stabilization as objectives for monetary policy. Is There a Single Long-run Objective? It is sometimes argued, however, that price stability can be the only objective for monetary policy in the long run, again placing price stability on a higher plane than full employment. In the long run, theory holds that the economy gravitates to full employment by self-equilibrating forces, principally through the effects of price flexibility. That is, if the economy is operating at a level of output below full employment, the price level will tend to fall, and at least for a given value of the nominal money supply, this will tend to stimulate aggregate demand. Over time, this process will raise aggregate demand to a level consistent with full employment. Hence, policymakers do not have to be concerned with full employment in the long run, leaving price stability as their unique long-run concern. But this view is misleading in a couple of respects. First, monetary policymakers should be concerned about two long-run properties of the economy. One is price stability and the other is the variability of output around full employment. Policy has to be judged by its success in both dimensions. Second, policy is made in the short run, not the long run. The speed of return of output to its potential level is influenced by policy decisions and cannot be treated with indifference. It may just take too long and waste too many resources in the interim to rely on the self-equilibrating forces of the economy. Policymakers will therefore have to take into account, in practice, both objectives in their policy actions. Still, a meaningful difference in the interpretation of the two objectives remains. A central bank can achieve the inflation target, with considerable precision, in the long run, meaning on average over a period of years. But it cannot be expected to maintain the economy continuously at full employment. The full employment objective might therefore be better interpreted as an output stabilization objective. It instructs the central bank to work to reduce the variability of output around its full employment level. The Need for Flexibility The purpose of a hierarchical mandate is to impose constraints on the operation of monetary policy, constraints that proponents believe enhance credibility, focus policy on what monetary policy can achieve, and reduce political pressures for policy to aim at impossible-to-achieve and potentially destabilizing output goals, such as a level of output above the economy's maximum sustainable rate. However, those same constraints might interfere with the pursuit of other legitimate objectives of monetary policy, specifically with policy adjustments to reduce the variability of output around potential output. Most inflation-targeting regimes explicitly recognize that returning inflation to its target too rapidly following some departure could result in excessive variability of output. The solution has been to encourage a gradual return to the inflation target by explicitly or implicitly setting a policy horizon over which policymakers commit to return inflation to its target. Setting fixed horizons for the return to the inflation target, independent of the size or the nature of the shock, clearly reduces the flexibility of monetary policy. To be fair, many regimes explicitly note that the policy horizons need not be fixed or include escape clauses that would allow greater flexibility, for example, in response to a supply shock. But setting a policy horizon is intended to, and does, constrain policy responses. It may therefore interfere with an appropriate balancing of the full-employment and price-stability goals. This is especially the case if the mandate is hierarchical, where other objectives can be pursued only if the inflation objective is achieved. The Taylor Rule and the Dual Mandate The Taylor rule is a useful characterization of U.S. monetary policy. According to the Taylor rule, monetary policymakers should adjust the target for the short-term interest rate in response to deviations of output and inflation from their respective targets and in response to changes in inflation. It is therefore well aligned with a dual mandate. The Taylor rule can be written as (2) R = r * + p + c [( y / y *)-1] + d ( p - p *) where R is the target nominal policy rate, r * is the equilibrium real level of the policy rate (consistent with price stability and full employment), y is output, y * is the level of potential output, p is inflation, p * is the target for inflation, and c and d are the parameters that describe the response of the policy rate to deviations of output and inflation from their respective targets. The Taylor rule is consistent with the loss function described in equation 1 because the rule prescribes an adjustment of the federal funds rate in response to the deviations from target values that are presumed to give rise to costs to society. The Taylor rule also helps to make the point that policymakers can operate with an output stabilization goal and still ensure that inflation is, on average, consistent with the inflation target in the long run. A strict version of inflation targeting would be one based on a loss function, taking into account only losses associated with inflation deviating from its target. In terms of equation 1, that would mean that a = 0--that is, no costs were associated with deviation of output from its potential level. Based on a simple model, we could derive an optimal policy response to shocks, based on this loss function and the more general one where costs are assigned to deviations from both price stability and full employment. If policy is set assuming a = 0 (as would be the case in a very strict inflation-targeting regime), it is clear that policy will be suboptimal if the true loss function does assign a cost to deviating from full employment. The more difficult question is: How suboptimal are inflation-targeting regimes that recognize the costs of excessive output variability, but nevertheless constrain monetary policymakers from responding to deviations of output from its target, except when the inflation target has already been met or when policymakers can project that it will be met in a reasonable period? In my view, such regimes are likely to remain suboptimal, compared with a more flexible dual-mandate regime. Transparency, Accountability, and the Dual Mandate As I noted, transparency about monetary policy requires a full and accurate account of the objectives. But pretending that inflation is the only objective, while taking account of output variability in practice, only makes for less-transparent policy and ensures that the central bank will have difficulty communicating the rationale for its policy actions. I remember the first conference I attended after joining the Board of Governors. Two foreign central bankers--each from inflation-targeting countries--lectured me about how "good" central bankers acted in public. They each told me that a disciplined central banker would never admit to having a stabilization objective and never admit that there was a cost of lowering inflation. Such admissions, they warned, would only undermine the public's confidence in a central banker's commitment to price stability. I responded that this lesson in central banking surprised me. I would not have thought obfuscating about policy objectives or the way monetary policy affects the economy would have enhanced the credibility of a policymaker. I still don't. III. The Case for an Explicit Inflation Target An explicit inflation target would, in my view, give added precision to an already mandated objective. Three of the arguments for inflation-targeting regimes, it seems to me, also support an explicit inflation target within a dual mandate. First, an explicit inflation target would improve the transparency and accountability of monetary policy. Second, it might help, at the margin, to anchor inflation expectations. Third, it would help to institutionalize recent good monetary policy. It would also, in my view, make the decisionmaking process more coherent. Indeed, moving in this direction would extract most of the benefits of an inflation-targeting regime without suffering the loss of flexibility inherent in its hierarchical mandate. Improving Transparency and Accountability Transparency is an important goal for monetary policymakers for two reasons. First, a more transparent policy may be a more effective one. Monetary policy works both through the setting of a target short-term nominal interest rate and by the expectations policymakers induce in the markets, wittingly or unwittingly, about the course of future policy. To the extent that market participants correctly anticipate future policy moves, long-term interest rates will move in response to expectations of future moves in short-term rates, in effect, speeding the response of aggregate demand to monetary policy. Second, central bank independence has to be balanced by accountability. More precise goals increase both the transparency and the accountability of monetary policy. Anchoring Inflation Expectations and Increasing Credibility Anchoring inflation expectations at the targeted rate of inflation is an important goal for monetary policy. However, whether an explicit inflation target or a formal inflation-targeting regime would boost the credibility of the central bank's commitment to price stability is more debatable. In my judgment, credibility is primarily earned by performance. In addition, there is little empirical evidence to suggest that either explicit inflation targets or inflation-targeting regimes lower the cost of disinflation by directly lowering inflation expectations. Still, at the margin, such a target might enhance the ability of the Fed to anchor inflation expectations and perhaps also enhance the ability of the Fed to pursue its stabilization objective without undermining the public's confidence in its commitment to low inflation. Institutionalizing Good Monetary Policy Most observers would rate monetary policy in the United States over the last two decades as very good. Good policy, in turn, depends on the combination of a well-defined mandate, a disciplined strategy for achieving the mandate, and the quality of the FOMC and its staff working to implement the strategy. The Chairman has considerable influence over the policy outcome, disproportionate to the one vote he or she casts, so that the quality of the chairman is especially important. The Federal Reserve has been fortunate to have strong leadership for many years under both Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan. A more fully articulated mandate could help ensure that policy remains well focused and disciplined as the leadership of the Fed changes. Facilitating the Policymaking Process The Fed staff routinely shows policymakers the prescriptions from several Taylor-rule type policy reaction functions and such a rule is explicitly incorporated into the Fed's large-scale model used for policy analysis. The staff has never asked FOMC members about their preferences for a numerical inflation target and instead often employs the target that John Taylor used in the policy rule he introduced in 1993. I have great regard for John, but this seems to be a rather unusual way for a policy rule to be run at the Fed. More important, if the target is implicit, and therefore imprecise, members of the FOMC inevitably will each make policy decisions in pursuit of different inflation targets. It seems to me that the internal discussion of policy would be more coherent if policymakers agreed in advance on an inflation objective. There would still be differences in policy preferences at FOMC meetings due, for example, to different views about the economic outlook, different views about the structure of the economy, and different views about the sustainable level of the unemployment rate or the maximum sustainable rate of growth in output. But, provided that all FOMC members agreed to seek the objective chosen by the majority, an explicit target would prevent members from pulling in different directions because of different inflation objectives. Retaining Flexibility with the Dual Mandate The key issue for me is whether setting an explicit inflation target would reduce the flexibility of policymakers to pursue a dual mandate and select the preferred point along the tradeoff between output and inflation variability. That is, would making the p* in the Taylor rule explicit inevitably also lead to a change in the relative responses to deviations from the output and inflation targets (the c and d parameters in equation 2)? Specifically, would implementing an explicit inflation target inevitably also raise the response parameter on the inflation gap relative to that on the output gap? In my view, the answer is that this need not be the case, but I agree that there is some risk of this outcome. It seems to me, however, that it is less likely if the move to an explicit inflation target is taken in the context of a reaffirmation of the dual mandate. If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It As I noted above, most observers believe that monetary policy has been excellent in recent years. Why, then, change the underlying framework for policy, especially when this change is not likely to have much of an influence on the conduct of monetary policy? The case for moving to an explicit inflation target within our current dual mandate is that it extracts most of the potential benefits of inflation-targeting regimes without necessarily reducing the flexibility of policy. I believe that the Fed remains more responsive to deviations of output from its target than most inflation-targeting central banks, even allowing for the convergence that has been under way. I believe we could retain that flexibility with an explicit inflation target because of our historical commitment to a dual mandate and because there would be no presumption that the fundamental strategy for conducting monetary policy, summarized by the Taylor rule, would change. At the same time, I believe transparency and accountability are appropriate goals for monetary policymakers and that an explicit inflation target would contribute to each of these goals, even if it would not have had much effect on the actual course of policy in recent years. Should the Full Employment Objective Be Explicit Also? A natural question in the case of a dual mandate is whether both objectives should be made explicit. Some members of the Congress, for example, might encourage the Fed to adopt an explicit objective for full employment to balance an explicit inflation objective. Although I support an explicit objective for inflation, it would not be constructive, in my view, to set an explicit numerical target for full employment. The central bank is capable of achieving an inflation objective, at least on average over a period of years. In contrast, if we define full employment in terms of a threshold for the unemployment rate consistent with maximum sustainable employment, the central bank has no choice about what this threshold should be. It is determined by the structure of the economy, including the effectiveness of institutions and markets in matching vacancies and unemployed workers, and by policies, such as the levels of unemployment compensation and minimum wage rates. Because institutions and markets evolve and labor market policies change, it would be inappropriate to set a fixed numerical objective for full employment. That does not rule out central banks being more transparent about their estimate of the unemployment rate that is consistent with maximum sustainable employment, though no central bank has ventured into this territory. That's perhaps not surprising. Indeed, it would be difficult to do so because there is considerable debate--both inside and outside central banks--about the usefulness of a "full employment rate of unemployment" as a guide to policy and, even among those who believe this is an important and useful concept, about what that rate may be today and how it tends to change over time. So the issue here is not simply one of transparency and accountability. In addition, political considerations may be at work. At times, an increase in the unemployment rate may be required to sustain stable, low inflation. Rare is the leader of a monetary policy committee who relishes going to the legislature and reporting that the central bank is concerned that too many people have jobs. The uncertainty about the threshold unemployment rate also suggests a differing degree of intensity in the response of monetary policy to deviations of inflation and output to their respective targets. That uncertainty derives from our inability to precisely pin down two key parameters--the threshold unemployment rate and the trend rate of growth in potential output. As a result, there is a subtle difference between the two objectives in the dual mandate. One objective--price stability--can be well defined and is fully under the control of monetary policymakers, at least over a period of time. The other--full employment--is set by the structure of the economy, not policymakers, and cannot be precisely pinned down numerically at any point in time and can vary over time. IV. Practical Considerations Let us now assume that a decision has been made to move to an explicit inflation target. Several steps would be required to implement such a decision. First, we would have to decide who would set the explicit target. Second, a specific price index would have to be selected to serve as the basis for the inflation target. Third, we would have to decide whether the target should be a point or a range. Fourth, we would have to decide on the level of the point or the values that establish the range. Who Should Set the Inflation Target? Among inflation-targeting regimes, there is a mix of practices with respect to who sets the numerical target for inflation. In almost all cases, the government identifies price stability as a target, either as the single target or as part of a hierarchical mandate. In about half the cases, the explicit numerical target for inflation is set by the government, typically the finance ministry, generally in consultation with the central bank; in about half the cases, the target is set by the central bank, often in consultation with the finance ministry. The United States already has a mandate that includes price stability. The existing law therefore seems to be compatible with the Federal Reserve setting an explicit numerical inflation rate consistent with the notion of price stability. Thus, the FOMC could move in this direction without any amendment to the Federal Reserve Act. Perhaps the setting of an explicit inflation target by the Federal Reserve might be analogous to its earlier setting of numerical money growth ranges. In 1978, the Congress instructed the Fed to report an objective for money growth. The FOMC then decided unilaterally on the numerical ranges. In 2000, the Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act to remove the requirement that the Fed report to the Congress on the ranges for monetary aggregates. In the case of an inflation objective, the Congress has already imposed a price-stability objective. All the FOMC would be doing is communicating back to the Congress and the public its interpretation of that objective. Nevertheless, such a move would likely be interpreted as an important change in the conduct of monetary policy. Consequently, if the FOMC desired to move in this direction, extensive prior consultations would be appropriate, especially with the Congress, but also with the Administration. It might also be constructive to get feedback from a wider audience on a proposal to set an explicit inflation target before proceeding in this direction. It would, however, be problematic for the United States to follow the approach in many inflation-targeting countries of having the ministry of finance (in our case, the Treasury Department) set the inflation target. Such an approach is more comfortable politically in a parliamentary system, in which the legislative and executive branches are always controlled by the same party or coalition. It seems unlikely that the Congress would delegate this responsibility to the Treasury Department. Even regular consultation with the Treasury department about a specific goal under the approach I have mentioned here might raise questions unless the Congress explicitly authorized it. Choosing a Specific Price Index Most broad measures of inflation move roughly in concert over time. Nevertheless, the differentials among the most widely used aggregate measures of inflation generally are not stable over long periods. Therefore, it does make some difference which measure is selected for the target. All inflation-targeting central banks use a measure of consumer price inflation for their target. In the absence of a complete model of the cost of inflation to guide the choice, the use of consumer price measures seems appropriate because these measures are the most relevant to the calculation of real income for households, because the welfare of households is ultimately the goal for monetary policy, and because measures of consumer price inflation are often the most visible of inflation measures. In the United States, this would mean a choice between the consumer price index (CPI) and the price index for personal consumption expenditures. The CPI is the most widely recognized measure of consumer price inflation, but the Federal Reserve has expressed the view that the measure based on personal consumption expenditures has advantages as a measure of trends in consumer price inflation. Setting the inflation rate in terms of the price index for personal consumption expenditures would further elevate this measure in the public consciousness. A related decision is whether to set the target in terms of overall inflation or in terms of core inflation--that is, consumer price inflation net of the direct influence of movements in energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile. Focusing on core inflation might increase the likelihood that monetary policy would respond to underlying inflation developments that promised to be persistent, and not on transitory changes in inflation. Nevertheless, most inflation-targeting regimes set their explicit inflation target in terms of overall inflation. As long as policy is focused on achieving a longer-run inflation outcome, as opposed to meeting the target each quarter or even each year, a target for overall inflation can work well, because swings in energy and food prices that lead to shorter-run inflation blips tend to dissipate or wash out over longer periods. In this case, it would also be useful, as is the practice at some inflation-targeting central banks, to monitor movements in core inflation as a guide to whether current monetary policy is well aligned with the longer-term objective for overall inflation. Weighing the pros and cons, policy might be better and the communication to the public might be most clear if the target itself was expressed in terms of the core inflation rate. Point or Range Practice differs among inflation-targeting central banks, with about half setting their targets as points and the other half as ranges. Among those who adopt ranges, some also identify the midpoint of the range as the specific target. I prefer a point target. This provides a more precise anchor for inflation expectations and a more specific target for monetary policymakers. If a range is selected, questions will arise about the differing implications of movements of inflation inside the range and outside the range and, in the absence of explicitly identifying the mid-point as the target, about where within the range policymakers would prefer inflation to gravitate. If there is indifference about movements inside the range, this will tilt policy toward allowing greater variability of inflation. What Level? If the objective is price stability, this may seem like a pointless question. But it is an important issue for two reasons. First, assuming that the official indexes are biased upward, true price stability will be achieved at some positive rate for measured inflation. Second, there are considerations that favor allowing some small positive rate of true inflation, rather than true price stability. In 1995, the Boskin Commission estimated that the measurement bias for the CPI was between 0.8 and 1.6 percentage points. Since then, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has made a series of methodological improvements in the CPI, lowering the bias. In 1999, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the cumulative effects of these improvements had been to reduce the measurement error to a point estimate of 0.8 percent. Therefore, in terms of the CPI, if this were the only consideration, the target could be set at 1 percent to allow for measurement error (and also a round number). This also suggests that the target should not be fixed in time, but should be adjusted over time to take into account changes in the estimated bias. There are a couple of reasons to consider setting an inflation target above the level consistent with true price stability. If there is resistance to declines in nominal wages, a small amount of wage inflation may enhance the flexibility of real wages and facilitate the movement to equilibrium in the labor market. Whether this requires positive price inflation will depend on the variance of the wage changes, the degree of nominal wage rigidity, and the rate of growth of labor productivity. In addition, a positive rate of inflation increases the flexibility of monetary policy by allowing policymakers to drive real interest rates below zero. Particularly in light of the latter consideration, I would set the inflation target at what I refer to as true price stability plus a small cushion. Specifically, for the CPI, I would set it at 2 percent, 1 percentage point for the measurement error and 1 percentage point for the cushion. This would correspond roughly to a 1-1/2 percent inflation rate for the price index for personal consumption expenditures, based on recent differentials of this measure relative to the inflation rate for the CPI. The precise magnitude of the cushion should also be subject to adjustment over time to reflect ongoing research about its optimal size. Time Horizon There should be no fixed time horizon for returning inflation to its target when deviations occur. Such a horizon would be arbitrary, in some cases might not be credible, and potentially would constrain the ability of the FOMC to pursue the dual mandate. On the other hand, it would be useful to use a measure for inflation that smoothes over transient shocks and that is not subject to potential problems with seasonal adjustment. For that reason, I would favor a year-over-year measure of the inflation rate--for example, a twelve-month CPI or price index for personal consumption expenditures--for evaluating performance relative to the target. V. Conclusion It is widely agreed that price stability is an important objective of monetary policy and that central banks should be held responsible for that objective. That said, central banks differ over whether they should set an explicit inflation target and whether they should acknowledge and take responsibility for other objectives, specifically full employment or output stabilization. An explicit inflation target would give added precision to an already mandated objective and would thereby improve the transparency of and accountability for monetary policy. Moving to an explicit inflation target would, in my view, be consistent with the current statute governing the objectives of monetary policy in the United States and would, in turn, require no fundamental change in the current Federal Reserve strategy for implementing monetary policy. The most important question that has to be addressed in order to assess the costs and benefits of a move in this direction is whether it could be accomplished without reducing the flexibility the Fed now has to pursue a dual mandate. In my view, if the explicit mandate is set in the context of a reaffirmation of the dual mandate, the flexibility now enjoyed by U.S. monetary policy will likely be maintained. A second question is whether moving in this direction would matter much for the conduct of monetary policy in the United States. I believe the answer to that question is that it would not matter much today, with the current Chairman and the current FOMC. But moving in this direction would provide some greater assurance of continuity in policy. In addition, it would have the virtue of enhancing transparency and accountability. Footnotes See, for example, Bernanke et al. (1999) and Gramlich (2000). Volcker (1983). Greenspan (1994). King (1997). Svensson (1999). For a discussion of the case for price stability, see Fischer (1996). Much of this research involves simulations of empirical macroeconomic models with alternative policy rules. The simple policy rules used in these exercises mimic the systematic aspects of the response of discretionary policy to changes in the macroeconomy. For example, Taylor has shown that Federal Reserve policy actions in recent years have been broadly similar to what a simple policy rule would have prescribed. These exercises therefore demonstrate the ability of simple rules--and by extension, discretionary monetary policy more broadly--to both reduce the variability of output and achieve a long-run inflation target. See Taylor (1999) for a series of papers involving simulations of models with various policy rules. Squaring the deviations from target values also penalizes larger deviations more than proportionately compared to smaller ones. Levin, Volker and Williams (1999) analyze the output-inflation volatility frontier in four different macroeconomic models. For some supporting evidence, see Cecchetti and Ehrmann (2001). Taylor (1993). A Taylor rule could also be consistent with a regime that set inflation as the sole objective. In this case, the output gap terms would be viewed as a predictor of inflation, allowing policymakers to take pre-emptive action to contain the threat of higher inflation, in addition to directly responding to higher inflation itself. See Kim and Henderson (2000). This threshold is often referred to as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment or the NAIRU. See Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1966). See Fuhrer and Sniderman (2000) for a series of papers on the implications of a zero nominal bound for the nominal interest rate for setting inflation targets. The paper by Reifschneider and Williams in that volume provides some support for the one percentage point cushion I have suggested. They conclude: "[I]n very low inflation environmentsï¿½the zero bound could prove to be a significant constraint on policyï¿½With the effectiveness of open market operations diminished at times, the economy would likely experience a noticeable increase in the variability of output and employment, particularly if policymakers were to pursue an inflation target of 1 percent or below."

Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. Before the Charlotte Economics Club, Charlotte, North Carolina July 18, 2001 Reflections on the Capital Goods Overhang I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the Charlotte Economics Club. Occasions such as this provide those of us who work on economic policy in Washington an invaluable way to touch base and exchange ideas with business leaders around the country. The views that I will set forth today are my own and are not necessarily shared by other members of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. As you know, economic growth has been slow for four quarters after several years of very strong gains. Perhaps the most striking aspect of this slowdown has been the abrupt deceleration in business fixed investment. Business investment in equipment and software grew exceptionally rapidly in the latter half of the 1990s and the first half of 2000, but it moved down in the final quarter of last year and declined further in the first quarter of 2001. Indicators of second-quarter investment outlays have been decidedly downbeat. More dramatic still is the turnabout in a number of high-tech investment categories. Real business outlays on information-processing equipment dropped at an annual rate of almost 10 percent in the first quarter of this year after having posted increases that averaged close to 25 percent a year from 1997 through 2000. Within that category, real investment in computers and related equipment showed no growth in the first quarter of this year after having risen 30 percent or more in each of the seven years starting in 1994. Outlays for communications equipment swung from growth rates of about 25 percent in 1999 and 2000 to an annual rate of decline of more than 30 percent in the first quarter of this year. The cutback in business spending on high-tech equipment has led, in turn, to sharp cutbacks in output at the firms that produce such equipment. Many of these firms have experienced sharp declines in actual and anticipated profits, and the values of their equities have dropped. Business fixed investment has always been cyclical, of course. When the economy is speeding up, businesses typically respond by boosting their expansion plans, and the resulting increment to the desired capital stock leads to a burst of investment spending. Similarly, when the economy slows, plans for capital expansion are shaded down, and investment is scaled down or perhaps even postponed for a time. Because the stock of capital is large relative to the investment spending in any particular year, a relatively small shift in expansion plans generates a big swing in current expenditures. This is the accelerator effect that is commonly discussed in economics textbooks. However, some observers believe that what has been happening recently to business fixed investment differs in some important respects, or at least in degree, from the normal accelerator response to a slowdown in aggregate demand. These observers hypothesize that, for a variety of reasons, including the more subdued prospects for aggregate demand going forward, firms may be holding considerably more capital now than they would prefer. Reflecting this possibility is the opinion we hear that there is currently an "overhang" of capital in the economy. According to this view, too much was put in place too soon, and as a corollary, investment spending will need to remain subdued for a long enough time in the future to let the actual capital stock come back into line with the desired capital stock. In the remainder of my talk today, I wish to explore more fully this question of a capital stock overhang. Along the way, I will be laying out some analytical distinctions that are important to understanding exactly what we mean when we talk about an overhang of capital. At the same time, I will try to demonstrate why a capital overhang is so difficult to identify and estimate in practice. I plan to give some special attention to those high-tech industries in which the turnabout in investment spending has been the most dramatic this past year, notably telecommunications industries. Finally, I will have some brief comments about the implications of a capital overhang for the economy and for monetary policy. Measuring the Capital Goods Overhang Capital, by definition, has value because it is expected to generate income in the future. In view of that orientation toward the future, the value placed on capital can shift considerably as expectations change. Some of the same firms that might have felt comfortable with their capital stocks a year ago, or even been of the view that more capital was needed, may now view their capital as being excessive in light of the abrupt slowing in demand for their products, especially if they extrapolate the slowdown well into the future. Moreover, values that are placed on particular pieces of capital can change sharply as advances in technology make one form of equipment obsolete while creating an incentive for the rapid expansion of the stock of another form of equipment. It might seem that business executives are the people best positioned to know if capital is indeed excessive at the moment. However, as is often the case, reports from individual firms cover a wide range of situations. Reports from high-tech companies at present are notable for the frequency with which talk of excess capital appears, and we hear reports of overhangs in some other industries as well. Many firms, particularly in the high-tech sector, have been surprised by the slump in demand or by the entry of competitors or the introduction of new products. In many of these instances, capital spending plans have been shelved or delayed. But the anecdotal evidence does not all point in one direction. A recent survey from the National Association for Business Economics showed that, at least among the companies that belong to that organization, the number of firms that perceive that they are still under-invested in high-tech equipment exceeds the number that have over-invested by a considerable margin. How those numbers translate into dollars is uncertain, of course, but the survey does remind us that we have to be cautious about the lessons we draw from the anecdotes. We also have to be a little cautious about the inferences we draw from the recent sluggishness in investment. In particular, a downturn in investment does not, by itself, imply that firms view their capital stocks as being too large. The rate of change in the stock of capital reflects both the spending on new capital--that is, gross investment--and the rate at which capital is being consumed, mainly through depreciation. Even at rates well below those of a year ago, today's investment still likely exceeds by a significant margin the pace at which capital is depreciating. Thus, the stock of capital, at least for the economy as a whole, probably is still expanding at a brisk pace. We can say with a reasonable degree of confidence that the investment cutback of recent quarters demonstrates that businesses did not want to continue adding to their capital stocks at quite the pace that they were a while back. But whether the stock itself is too large is a different question and one to which the answer is less clear. And because the composition of the capital stock is so enormously varied, the answer will no doubt be that some forms are held greatly in excess of desired levels, some well below desired levels, and others approximately at the desired levels. Alternatively, one might turn to econometric modeling to estimate the magnitude of such an overhang. The economics profession provides us with the logic for determining whether the stock of capital is excessive, namely the difference between the desired, or target, capital stock and the actual stock. However, empirical models are conditioned on a number of assumptions, not only about the longer-run prospects for economic growth but also about the ways in which capital and labor interact in the productive process. Such calculations require that desired and target stocks be valued for widely heterogeneous types of plant and equipment, of differing vintages and in differing states of operating efficiency. The size of the overhang can be estimated following these methods, but the results are bounded by wide ranges of uncertainty. The financial markets have perhaps provided some of the strongest signals that the capital stock might have started growing too fast in recent years and that it might be excessive in some sectors. For example, the performance of the stock market has mirrored, in a rough way, what has happened to business fixed investment. The stock market boom of the late 1990s was associated with a growing optimism on the part of both firms and investors about future profit growth. Between 1992 and the peak in 2000, expected long-term earnings growth rates for technology firms in the S&P 500 increased from 12 percent at an annual rate to more than 22 percent . Similarly, expectations of long-term earnings growth for telecom service providers--widely anticipated to be beneficiaries of surging demand for Internet-related services--rose from 8 percent to 15 percent. Since early- to mid-2000, however, these supportive financial conditions have eroded amid concerns that Internet retailers and other "dot-coms" face severe challenges in achieving profitability. Technology and telecommunications stock price indexes began to slump in the spring of 2000, and financing conditions for start-ups cooled off. In addition, earnings-growth projections for telecom service providers began to decline around the middle of last year, as intense competition in long-distance telephony eroded profit margins for existing business lines, and the expansion in demand for advanced products such as digital subscriber lines (DSL) was less robust than had been hoped. With a retrenchment in capital spending under way, the drop in expectations for long-term growth began to extend to manufacturers of telecom equipment and other high-tech gear during the last few months of 2000, and conditions for many such firms have remained difficult in 2001. Will the Overhang Be Worked Off Quickly? The obvious question is: When will the stock adjustment in high-tech capital run its course, and the supply and demand for capital goods return to balance? This question is not answerable with certainty. There are reasons to be hopeful and reasons to be cautious. Just as firms might tend to overestimate their longer-term capital requirements when times are good, there likely is some tendency to underestimate longer-term needs when the economy is soft. Thus, it could well be that stocks of capital will not seem so excessive once the economy picks up. Moreover, as a number of observers have suggested, the fact that a capital stock overhang might be concentrated most heavily in the high-tech industries has one important silver lining. This advantage is that, on average, a good deal of high-tech equipment probably depreciates more rapidly than most other types of equipment. Consequently, with other things equal, the shorter life of some of the capital currently held in excess amounts would seem to imply that the overhang can be worked off more quickly than otherwise. There is much to be said for this point of view, and undoubtedly the adjustment process may progress more quickly than if the overhang were concentrated in other types of equipment or structures. Nonetheless, in the interest of exploring more fully the potential dynamics of high-tech capital investment, I would like to take a few minutes to examine why an overhang might take longer to work off than we might like or expect. And I have to emphasize here that I am focusing on some parts of the high-tech sector, not the sector as a whole, and certainly not the economy as a whole. One reason an overhang could persist is that some types of high-tech capital do not depreciate rapidly. For instance, unlike the equipment that sends signals down the optical fiber, the fiber itself probably has a useful lifetime that is reasonably long. Optical fiber today is not greatly different in quality from the fiber of a few years ago, and there is little physical deterioration once the fiber is in the ground. All this suggests that the excess capacity of total fiber could take quite some time to work off. And presumably other types of equipment and structures are similar in this respect to fiber. Second, depreciation rates are partly a reflection of economic obsolescence; that is, capital often loses value because of the expectation that it will soon be replaced by newer, more advanced equipment. However, the replacement decision is, to some degree, at the discretion of the firm that owns the capital. In the context of weaker-than-expected demand for their products, and hence weaker cash flow, businesses may decide that they prefer to hang onto their existing computer hardware, software, and communications equipment for longer than they otherwise might. Accordingly, it might presently be the case that high-tech equipment is not as short-lived as we think it usually is. Adding further to firms' willingness to hold on to their existing equipment through the current period is the apparent absence of new "killer apps," break-through technological advances in applications such as e-mail and web browsers that in the past have spurred investment in software and in complementary goods like computers and communications equipment. A third reason for caution in assuming that the overhang will be worked off quickly is that even if high-tech depreciation rates remain elevated, new investment could continue feeding into the capital stock because of planning lags, lengthy building times, or costly irreversibilities. For example, a national optical network can take years to roll out--longer than the average time to build a nonresidential structure. If demand falls below expectations, a firm might decide to persevere to completion of an investment project with a lengthy building time, but may be left with a capital good that is ill-suited to the conditions that prevail at the time of completion. Lastly, the situation of the high-tech industries is also complicated by some considerations that are difficult to capture in the normal calculations of investment and depreciation. One such factor is the changing market structure of the high-tech sector. In the mid-1990s, deregulation in the telecom industry and the rise of the Internet led to a surge of entrants into the high-tech areas. These startups not only generated a good deal of spending on capital goods themselves, they also forced incumbent firms to invest and innovate to keep up, even as profits were eroding. Survivor mentalities may have caused the competing firms to push capital outlays further than they might have otherwise, on the notion that the short-term losses recorded in stretching to expand market share could be made up later as competitors fell by the wayside. The creation of the long-haul fiber optic network, the part of the network that runs from city to city, provides perhaps the best illustration of the excesses that can develop as firms rush to establish their market positions. The creation of these networks may also indicate the complexities involved in determining the size of a capital overhang in a particular industry. In 1995, just three firms had significant long-haul fiber optic networks in the United States. By 2000, however, there were nine such firms, and by the end of this year, there will be several more. In some regions of the country, the numbers are larger still, with some major cities in the Midwest being served by as many as twenty long-haul firms. The competing long-haul firms have laid huge amounts of fiber over the past few years. Not only do numerous firms compete, but each firm also has the incentive to put in place more fiber than it might need in the immediate future. As I mentioned before, the optical fiber itself is long-lasting, and the quality of new fiber has tended to increase only slowly over time. Thus, with the risk of obsolescence low, investment could be targeted more toward anticipated long-run needs. Moreover, fiber itself is relatively cheap. By contrast, the vastly greater expense in building a network is the construction cost associated with laying the fiber. Indeed, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the cost per mile of fiber is something like $170, whereas the cost of installation is more on the order of $125,000 per mile. In that context, it is not surprising that firms would lay excess amounts of fiber in a given trench once the ground is broken. In contrast to the fiber itself, the equipment that is used to transmit and receive data over the network has been subject to very rapid technological change, and the economic considerations of investing in this type of equipment are similar to those for computers and other types of capital goods that rapidly become obsolete because of the fast pace of technological change. Although some overhangs of the transmitting and receiving equipment may be present, the stock of such equipment has likely been tied more closely to current and near-term demand than is the case for fiber. Accordingly, the extent of overcapacity for this equipment is likely to be less severe. Moreover, two forces should operate in the direction of resolving any overhang in relatively speedy fashion--namely, that the equipment depreciates rapidly, and also that the amount of information being transmitted over the Internet is still growing very rapidly, roughly doubling each year since the start of the 1990s. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of what is sometimes referred to as "last mile" capacity, the component of the network that runs from a long-haul node in a particular geographic area to individual businesses and homes. In view of that shortage and of the excess amount of long-haul fiber, patterns of investment are shifting. Industry analysts expect that in 2001 more fiber will be laid by cable companies and short-haul providers than by long-haul providers, and this gap is likely to widen in coming years. Thus, even in the hard-pressed telecommunications industry, we are probably going to see continued rapid expansion in some types of capital, even as overhangs of capital may persist in other areas. Macroeconomic Implications For the economy as a whole, it seems likely that the overall stock of high-tech capital will grow rapidly over time, even if installation of some types of high-tech equipment and structures may be slowing down. The economic benefits of making such investments still appear to be quite persuasive in many cases. There is no evidence of an end to the growth in the amount of information that can be put on a computer chip. Computers coming on the market are getting more powerful year by year, and their prices still are falling quite rapidly. The pressures on firms to remain competitive should keep them from putting off investments in new, lower-cost products for very long. All in all, I am hopeful that we will look back on the present concerns about excess stocks of capital as only a temporary interlude in the ongoing transformation of the economy toward more and more advanced technologies. In terms of macroeconomic performance, the increase in the high-tech capital stock is important because of the boost it has given to the growth of structural productivity over the past few years. Productivity growth has benefited not only from an increase in the amount of capital per worker, especially of high-tech capital, but also from the enhanced efficiencies that have been made possible in combining labor and capital in the workplace. I realize, of course, that measured productivity growth has not been all that impressive in recent quarters. That weakness, however, almost surely is a reflection of the sluggishness of the economy, rather than a sign that structural productivity might be reverting to the slow rate of growth that was evident before the mid-1990s. I continue to be cautiously optimistic that the prospects for healthy gains in productivity over the longer term still are quite favorable. In light of the overhang in some types of capital, some have wondered whether monetary policy might be less effective in combating the current economic weakness than otherwise. After all, conditions in short-term money markets, by themselves, are unlikely to induce substantial further investment, for example, in the long-haul fiber network. However, it would be a mistake to focus on only one channel of monetary influence, such as the impact that policy might have on the demand for high-tech equipment. Monetary policy works on a wide variety of spending, including housing, consumption expenditures, and net exports, and the channels through which policy works range broadly across the financial markets. Just as in the past, an easing of policy is likely, over time, to provide impetus to growth of demand in the aggregate, even if it does not immediately lift the prospects of the hard-pressed firms in some high-tech industries. Nonetheless, despite our aggressive easing actions of the first half of this year, I believe that it is too early to say definitively that the current period of subpar growth has ended. Given the likely magnitude of the capital goods adjustment that I have just discussed, as well as other forces, I expect only a gradual pick-up in the rate of growth later this year. Against that background, I continue to believe that the balance of risks seems to be toward continuing weakness in the economy. Conclusion In sum, although it is difficult to determine how large the overhangs of capital might be at present, they seem likely to exert at least a modest amount of drag on the economy over the near term, even as growth picks up. Over time, though, the discrepancy between actual and desired stocks of capital will be worked off, both as actual holdings diminish through depreciation, and as target holdings increase with the revival of aggregate demand. The overhang does not require that we alter our basic approach to monetary policy: We still maintain the ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. Mainly, the overhang factors into our thinking through the risk it might pose to the intermediate-term outlook for economic activity and employment. Over the long term, the current problems almost surely will be resolved in the ways that markets have solved past problems of capital misallocation: Investments that no longer seem likely to earn the profits that had been expected will be written off, at the same time that capital is being reallocated toward emerging opportunities. Overall, I remain cautiously optimistic about the long-run prospects for investment in new technologies, and for the beneficial implications that will have for the U.S. and world economies.
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 19, 2001 Agencies Approve Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 The federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies today announced the approval of a joint interagency advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) regarding the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA directs the agencies to assess a financial institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, and to consider that record when acting on certain applications for deposit facilities. When the agencies revised the CRA regulations in 1995, they committed to review the regulations in 2002 to determine whether the revised regulations had met the goals of more objective, performance-based CRA evaluations. The ANPR, to be published in the Federal Register today by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, initiates this review of the CRA regulations. Through the ANPR, the agencies invite comment on a number of key issues raised since 1995 by representatives of financial institutions, consumer and community groups, members of Congress, and the public. The agencies also request comment on other issues related to the CRA regulations, including whether any change to the regulations would be beneficial or is warranted, and what steps the agencies might take instead of, or in addition to, revising the regulations. Comments from the public must be received by October 17, 2001 . Media Contacts: Federal Reserve Susan Stawick (202) 452-2955 FDIC David Barr (202) 898-6992 OCC Robert M.

Testimony of Governor Laurence H. Meyer Federal deposit insurance reform Before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives July 26, 2001 It is a pleasure, Mr. Chairman, to appear before this subcommittee to present the views of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on deposit insurance reform as proposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) this past spring. At this point, the Federal Reserve Boardï¿½s views are necessarily general because the FDICï¿½s recommendations were purposefully quite broad. That said, on behalf of the Board I want to compliment the FDIC for an excellent report that highlights the issues and develops an integrated framework for addressing them. We urge the Congress to use that framework for promptly developing a detailed legislative proposal that addresses the most important deficiencies in our current deposit insurance system. I hope my comments this morning will be helpful in doing so. Benefits and Costs of Deposit Insurance As background to our suggestions, the Board believes it is important first to understand the benefits and costs of deposit insurance. Deposit insurance has played a key--at times even critical--role in achieving the stability in banking and financial markets that has characterized the past almost seventy years. Deposit insurance, combined with other components of our banking safety net--the Federal Reserveï¿½s discount window and payment system guarantees--and with enhanced macroeconomic stability resulting from monetary and fiscal policies, has meant that periods of financial stress are no longer characterized by depositor runs on banks and thrifts. Quite the opposite: Asset holders now seek out deposits as safe havens when they have strong doubts about other financial assets. Looking beyond the contribution of deposit insurance to overall financial stability, we should not minimize the security it has brought to millions of households and small businesses. Deposit insurance has provided a safe and secure place for those households and small businesses with relatively modest amounts of financial assets to hold their transaction and other balances. These benefits of deposit insurance, as significant as they are, have not come without cost. The very same process that has ended deposit runs has made insured depositors largely indifferent to the risks taken by their banks because their funds are not at risk if their institution is unable to meet its obligations. As a result, the market discipline to control risks that insured depositors would otherwise have imposed on banks and thrifts has been weakened. Relieved of that discipline, banks and thrifts naturally feel less inhibited from taking on more risk than they would otherwise assume. No other type of private financial institution is able to attract funds from the public without regard to the risk it takes with its creditorsï¿½ resources. This incentive to take excessive risks is the so-called moral hazard problem of deposit insurance, the inducement to take risk at the expense of the insurer. Because of the reduced market discipline and moral hazard, there is an intensified need for government supervision to protect the interests of taxpayers and, in essence, substitute for the reduced market discipline. Deposit insurance and other components of the safety net also enable banks and thrifts to attract more resources than would otherwise be the case. In short, insured banks and thrifts receive a subsidy in the form of a government guarantee that allows them both to attract deposits at lower interest rates than would be required without deposit insurance and to take more risk without the fear of losing their deposit funding. Put another way, deposit insurance misallocates resources by breaking the link between risks and rewards for a select set of market competitors. From the very beginning, deposit insurance has involved a tradeoff. On the one hand, there are benefits from the contribution of deposit insurance to overall financial stability and the protection of small depositors. On the other hand, deposit insurance imposes costs from the inducement to risk-taking, the misallocation of resources, and the increased need for government supervision to protect the taxpayersï¿½ interests. The crafting of reforms of the deposit insurance system must struggle to balance these tradeoffs. Moreover, the Board urges, we should be reasonably certain that any reforms are aimed primarily at protecting the public interest and not the profits or market shares of particular businesses. The Federal Reserve Board believes that deposit insurance reforms should be designed to preserve the benefits of heightened financial stability and the protection of small depositors without at the same time increasing moral hazard or reducing market discipline. This view underpins the response of the Federal Reserve Board to the FDICï¿½s recommendations. In addition, although at this time we are responding to very broad recommendations, we urge that the implementing details be kept as straightforward as possible to minimize the risk of unintended consequences that comes with complexity. Recommendations for Reform The FDIC has made five broad recommendations. 1. Merging BIF and SAIF. The Board strongly supports the FDICï¿½s proposal to merge the BIF and SAIF funds. Because the charters and operations of banks and thrifts have become so similar, it makes no sense to continue the separate funds. Separate funds reflect the past, but neither the present nor the future. Equally important, the insurance products provided to the two sets of institutions are identical, and thus the premiums should be identical as well. Under current arrangements, the premiums could differ significantly if one of the funds fell below the designated reserve ratio of 1.25 percent of insured deposits and the other fund did not. Merging the funds would also diversify their risks and reduce administrative expenses. 2. Statutory Restrictions on Premiums. Current law requires the FDIC to impose higher premiums on riskier banks and thrifts but restricts its ability to impose any premium on well-capitalized and highly-rated institutions whenever the corresponding fundï¿½s reserves exceed 1.25 percent of insured deposits. The Board strongly endorses the FDIC recommendations that would (1) require that a premium be imposed on every insured depository institution, no matter how well capitalized and well rated it may be or how high the fundï¿½s reserves, and (2) eliminate the statutory restrictions on risk-based pricing. The current statutory requirement that free deposit insurance be provided to well-capitalized and well-rated banks when FDIC reserves exceed a predetermined ratio maximizes the subsidy provided to these institutions and is inconsistent with efforts to avoid inducing moral hazard. Put differently, the current rule requires the government to give away its valuable guarantee when fund reserves meet some ceiling level. This free guarantee is of value to banks and thrifts even when they themselves are in sound financial condition and when macroeconomic times are good. At the end of last year, 92 percent of banks and thrifts were paying no premium. Included in this group were banks that have never paid any premium for their, in some cases substantial, coverage and fast-growing entities whose past premiums were extraordinarily small relative to their current coverage. We believe that these anomalies were never intended by the framers of the Deposit Insurance Fund Act of 1996 and should be addressed by the Congress. The Congress did intend that the FDIC impose risk-based premiums, but the 1996 Act limits the ability of the FDIC to impose risk-based premiums on well-capitalized and well-rated banks. And these two variables--capital strength and examiner overall rating-- do not capture all of the risk that banks and thrifts could create for the insurer. The Board believes the FDIC should be free to establish risk categories based on any well-researched economic variables and to impose premiums commensurate with these risk classifications. Although a robust risk-based premium system would be technically difficult to design, a closer link between insurance premiums and individual bank or thrift risk would reduce moral hazard and the distortions in resource allocation that accompany deposit insurance. We note, however, that significant benefits in this regard are likely to require a substantial range of premiums but that the FDIC has concluded in its report that premiums for the riskiest banks would probably need to be capped in order to avoid inducing failure at these weaker institutions. We believe that capping premiums may end up costing the insurance fund more in the long run should these weak institutions fail anyway, with the delay increasing the ultimate cost of resolution. The Board has concluded, therefore, that if a cap is required, it should be set quite high so that risk-based premiums can be as effective as possible in deterring excessive risk-taking. 3. Designated Reserve Ratios and Premiums. The current law establishes a designated reserve ratio for BIF and SAIF of 1.25 percent. If that ratio is exceeded, the statute requires that premiums on well-capitalized and well-rated banks must be discontinued. If the ratio declines below 1.25 percent, the FDIC must develop a set of premiums to restore the reserve ratio to 1.25 percent; if it appears that the fund ratio cannot be restored to its statutorily designated level in twelve months, the law requires that a premium of at least 23 basis points be imposed on the least risky category of banks. These requirements are clearly procyclical, lowering or eliminating fees in good times when bank credit is readily available and fund reserves should be built up, and abruptly increasing fees sharply in times of weakness when bank credit availability is under pressure and fund resources are drawn down to cover the resolution of failed banks. The FDIC recommends that surcharges or rebates should be used to bring the fund back to the target reserve ratio gradually. The FDIC also recommends the possibility of a target range for the designated reserve ratio, over which the premiums may remain constant, rather than a fixed target reserve ratio and abruptly changing premiums. We strongly support such increased flexibility and smoothing of premiums. Indeed, we recommend that the FDICï¿½s suggested target reserve range be widened in order to reduce the need to change premiums sharply. Any floor or ceiling, regardless of its level, could result in requiring that premiums be increased at exactly the time when banks and thrifts could be under stress and, similarly, that premiums be reduced at the time that depositories are in the best position to fund an increase in reserves. Building a larger fund in good times and permitting it to decline when necessary are prerequisites to less variability in the premium. In addition to widening the range, the Board would recommend that the FDIC be given the latitude to temporarily relax floor or ceiling ratios on the basis of current and anticipated banking conditions and expected needs for resources to resolve failing institutions. 4. Rebates. Since its early days, the FDIC has rebated ï¿½excessï¿½ premiums whenever it felt its reserves were adequate. This procedure was replaced in the1996 law by the requirement that no premium be imposed on well-capitalized and highly rated banks and thrifts when the fund reaches its designated reserve ratio. The FDIC proposals would re-impose a minimum premium on all banks and thrifts and a more risk-sensitive premium structure. These provisions would be coupled with rebates for the stronger entities when the fund approaches what we recommend be a higher upper end of a target range than the FDIC has suggested, and surcharges when the Fund trends below what we suggest be a lower end of a target range. The FDIC also recommends that the rebates not be uniform for the stronger entities. Rather, the FDIC argues that rebates should be smaller for those banks that have paid premiums for only short periods or that have in the past paid premiums that are not commensurate with their present size and hence FDIC exposure. The devil, of course, is in the details. But this latter proposal makes considerable sense, and the Board endorses it. There are over 900 banks--some now quite large--that have never paid a premium, and without this modification they would continue to pay virtually nothing, net of rebates, as long as their strong capital and high supervisory ratings were maintained. Such an approach is both competitively inequitable and contributes to moral hazard. It should be addressed. 5. Indexing Insured-Deposit Coverage Ceilings. The FDIC recommends that the current $100,000 ceiling on insured deposits be indexed. The Board does not support this recommendation and believes that, at this time, the current ceiling should be maintained. In the Boardï¿½s judgment, it is unlikely that increased coverage, even by indexing, today would add measurably to the stability of the banking system. Macroeconomic policy and other elements of the safety net, combined with the current, still-significant level of deposit insurance, continue to underpin the stability of the financial system. Thus, the problem that increased coverage is designed to solve must be related to either the individual depositor, the party originally intended to be protected by deposit insurance, or to the individual bank or thrift. Clearly, both groups would prefer higher coverage if there were no costs. But Congress needs to be clear about the problem for which increased coverage would be the solution. Depositors. At the Federal Reserve, we frequently receive letters from banks urging that we support increased deposit insurance coverage. But we virtually never receive similar letters from depositors, who are not shy about sharing their many other concerns. This experience may reflect the fact that, as our surveys of consumer finances suggest, depositors are adept at achieving the level of deposit insurance coverage they desire by opening multiple accounts. Such spreading of asset holdings is perfectly consistent with the counsel always given to investors to diversify their assets--whether stocks, bonds, or mutual funds--across different issuers. The cost of diversifying for insured deposits is surely no greater than doing so for other assets. An individual bank would clearly prefer that the depositor maintain all of his or her funds at that bank, and would prefer to eliminate the need for depositor diversification by being able to offer higher deposit insurance coverage. Nonetheless, the depositor appears to have no great difficulty--should he or she want insured deposits--in finding multiple sources of fully insured accounts. In addition, the singular characteristic of postwar household financial asset holdings has been the increasing diversity of portfolio choices. The share of household financial assets in bank deposits has been declining steadily throughout the postwar period as households have taken advantage of innovations that make available to them attractive financial instruments with market rates of return. There has been no break in that trend that seems related to past increases in insurance ceilings. Indeed, the most dramatic substitution out of deposits in recent years has been from both insured and uninsured deposits to equities and mutual funds. It is difficult to believe that a change in ceilings during the 1990s would have made any measurable difference in that shift. In fact, bankersï¿½ comments and the data indicate that the weakness in stock prices in recent quarters has been marked by increased flows into bank and thrift deposits. Depository Institutions. Does the problem to be solved by increased deposit insurance coverage concern the individual depository institution? If so, the problem would necessarily be concentrated at smaller banks that generally do not have access to the money market or foreign branch networks for supplementary funds. Since the mid-1990s, banksï¿½ U.S. assets have grown at an average annual rate of 7.7 percent. Adjusted for the effects of mergers, the smaller banks, those below the largest 1,000, have actually grown at a more rapid average annual rate of 13 percent. Uninsured deposits at these smaller banks have also grown more rapidly than at larger banks--at average annual rates of 20.5 percent at the small banks versus 10.9 percent at the large banks, both on the same merger-adjusted basis. Clearly, small banks have a demonstrated skill and ability to compete for uninsured deposits. To be sure, uninsured deposits are more expensive than insured deposits, and bank costs would decline if their currently uninsured liabilities received a government guarantee. But that is a different matter, and raises the issue of a subsidy in its starkest terms. I might add that throughout the 1990s, small banksï¿½ return on equity was well maintained. Indeed, the attractiveness of banking is evidenced by the fact that 1,363 banks were chartered during the past decade, two-thirds since 1995, when bank credit demands began to intensify. Some small banks argue that they need enhanced deposit insurance coverage to equalize their competition with large banks because depositors prefer to put their uninsured funds in an institution considered too big to fail. As I have noted, however, small banks have more than held their own in the market for uninsured deposits. In addition, the Board rejects the notion that any bank is too big to fail. In FDICIA, Congress made it clear that the systemic-risk exception to the FDICï¿½s least-cost resolution of a failing bank should be invoked only under the most unusual circumstances. Moreover, the resolution rules under the systemic-risk exception do not require that uninsured depositors and other creditors, much less stockholders, be made whole. Consistent with this view, the market clearly believes that large institutions are not too big for uninsured creditors to take at least some loss, with spreads on their subordinated debt larger than those on similar debt of large and highly rated nonbank financial institutions. Indeed, there are no Aaa-rated U.S. banking organizations. Another argument often raised by smaller banks regarding the need for increased deposit insurance coverage is their inability to match the competition from those large securities firms and bank holding companies with multiple bank affiliates, offering multiple insured accounts through one organization. While the Board believes that such offerings are a misuse of deposit insurance, raising the coverage limit for each account would also increase the aggregate amount of insurance coverage that large multibank organizations would be able to offer, so the disparity would remain. Conclusion The Board commends the FDIC for its review, analysis, and recommendations for reform of the deposit insurance system. There are several aspects of that system that need reform. The Board supports, with some modifications, all of the FDICï¿½s recommendations except indexing of the current $100,000 ceiling. The thrust of our proposed modifications would call for a wider permissible range for the size of the fund relative to insured liabilities, reduced variation of the insurance premium as the relative size of the fund changes with banking and economic conditions, and a premium net of rebates. There may come a time when the Board finds that households and businesses with modest resources are finding difficulty in placing their funds in safe vehicles and/or that there is reason to be concerned that the level of deposit coverage could endanger financial stability. Should either of those events occur, the Board would call our concerns to the attention of the Congress and support adjustments to the ceiling by indexing or other methods. But today, in our judgment, neither financial stability, nor depositors, nor depositories are being disadvantaged by the current ceiling. Raising the ceiling now would extend the safety net, increase the government subsidy to banking, expand moral hazard, and reduce the incentive for market discipline, without providing any real public benefits. With no clear public benefit to increasing deposit insurance, the Board sees no reason to increase the scope of the safety net. Indeed, the Board believes the time has come to draw the line on expanding government guarantees.
