For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board today announced the issuance of an Order of Prohibition against Juan Echeverri, a former vice president and institution-affiliated party of the Miami agency of Banco Ganadero, S.A., Bogota, Colombia. Mr. Echeverri, without admitting to any allegations, consented to the issuance of the order due to his alleged receipt of bribes in connection with certain Banco Ganadero trade financing transactions. A copy of the order is attached.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board today announced the issuance of a Cease and Desist Order against United Security Bancorporation, Lincoln, Nebraska, and Harold S. Myers, and David C. Myers, both officers and directors of United. A copy of the order is attached.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board announced today its approval of the notice of Stichting Prioriteit ABN AMRO Holding, Stichting Administratiekantoor ABN AMRO Holding, ABN AMRO Holding N.V., and ABN AMRO Bank N.V., all of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and ABN AMRO North America, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, to acquire Standard Federal Bancorporation, Inc., and Standard Federal's wholly owned subsidiaries, Standard Federal Bank and Standard Brokerage Services, Inc., all of Troy, Michigan. Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action. Stichting Prioriteit ABN AMRO Holding Amsterdam, The Netherlands Stichting Administratiekantoor ABN AMRO Holding Amsterdam, The Netherlands ABN AMRO Holding N.V. Amsterdam, The Netherlands ABN AMRO Bank N.V. Amsterdam, The Netherlands ABN AMRO North America, Inc. Chicago, Illinois Order Approving the Acquisition of a Thrift Holding Company Stichting Prioriteit ABN AMRO Holding, Stichting Administratiekantoor ABN AMRO Holding, ABN AMRO Holding N.V., and ABN AMRO Bank N.V., all of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and ABN AMRO North America, Inc., Chicago, Illinois (collectively, the "Notificants"), bank holding companies within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act ("BHC Act"), have requested the Board's approval under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. §ï¿½1843(c)(8)) and section 225.23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 C.F.R. 225.23) to acquire Standard Federal Bancorporation, Inc. ("Standard Federal"), and Standard Federal's wholly owned subsidiaries, Standard Federal Bank and Standard Brokerage Services, Inc., all of Troy, Michigan, and thereby engage in operating a savings association and providing securities brokerage services pursuant to sections 225.25(b)(9) and 225.25(b)(15) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(9) and 225.25(b)(15)). Notice of the proposal, affording interested persons an opportunity to submit comments, has been published (62 Federal Register 7,231 (1997)). The time for filing comments has expired, and the Board has considered the notice and all comments received in light of the factors set forth in sectionï¿½4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. Notificants, with total consolidated assets of $344.4 billion, is the largest commercial banking organization in The Netherlands, and controls seven depository institutions in Illinois and one commercial bank in New York. ABN AMRO Bank N.V. operates branches in Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Seattle, Washington; and agencies in Atlanta, Georgia; Miami, Florida; Houston, Texas; and Los Angeles and San Francisco, California. Notificants also engage in a number of nonbanking activities in the United States. Standard Federal is the fifth largest depository institution in Michigan, controlling approximately $8.3 billion in deposits, representing 8.2ï¿½percent of total deposits in depository institutions in the state. Notificants and Standard Federal do not compete directly in any banking market. Accordingly, the Board has determined that consummation of the proposal would not have a significantly adverse effect on competition or the concentration of banking resources in any relevant banking market. The Board has determined that the operation of a savings association by a bank holding company is closely related to banking for purposes of sectionï¿½4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. In making this determination, the Board requires that savings associations acquired by bank holding companies conform their direct and indirect activities to those permissible for bank holding companies under sectionï¿½4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. Notificants have committed to conform all activities of Standard Federal and its subsidiaries to those permissible for bank holding companies under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act and Regulation Y. The Board also has determined that the provision of securities brokerage services is closely related to banking for purposes of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. In order to approve the proposal, the Board also must determine that the proposed activities are a proper incident to banking, that is, that the proposal "can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public . . . that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices." As part of its review of these factors, the Board considers the financial and managerial resources of the notificant and its subsidiaries and the effect the proposal would have on such resources. The Board notes that Notificants' capital ratios satisfy applicable risk-based capital standards under the Basle Accord and are considered equivalent to the capital levels that would be required of a U.S. banking organization. The Board also has considered recent financial statements and other available information, including pro forma financial statements and reports of examination, and determined that the proposed transaction would not have a significant effect on the financial resources of Notificants and their subsidiaries. In addition, the Board has considered the managerial resources of Notificants in light of all the facts of record, including information from several commenters who oppose the proposal ("Protestants"). Protestants allege that certain underwriting activities of the Foreign Parent outside the United States raise managerial concerns. These activities relate to the involvement of the Foreign Parent and an affiliate as underwriter for bonds issued by a trucking company in The Netherlands (the "Netherlands bond underwriting") and as trustee for the bondholders. Protestants also contend that the Foreign Parent and its affiliate were involved in conflicts of interests and self-dealing in The Netherlands in connection with the multiple roles they played in the Netherlands bond underwriting and as senior creditor of the company issuing the bonds. Notificants have denied Protestants' allegations of wrongdoing relating to the Netherlands bond underwriting. The matter is before the courts in The Netherlands, where a lower court has ruled in favor of the Foreign Parent and an appeal is pending. The allegations relating to the Netherlands bond underwriting involve issues governed by the securities and bankruptcy laws of a foreign country that can be adjudicated by the courts of that country. In accordance with its standard procedures, the Board has contacted Notificants' home country supervisors regarding the proposal. The Board has considered the extensive record of examination of Notificants' U.S. subsidiaries by their primary federal supervisors. Based on all the facts of record, including comments from Protestants, and for the reasons discussed above, the Board concludes that financial and managerial considerations are consistent with approval. The Board has full supervisory authority to take appropriate action if a court determines or an examination finds that Notificants have engaged in illegal or improper activities. Notificants indicate that the proposal would result in greater efficiencies, and, accordingly, would enable both institutions to offer their customers more services, lower costs, and added convenience. On the basis of the foregoing and all the facts of record, the Board has concluded that the proposal can be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh any possible adverse effects under the proper incident to banking standard of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. Based on the foregoing and all other facts of record, the Board has determined that the notice should be, and hereby is, approved. Approval of the notice is specifically conditioned on compliance by Notificants with all the commitments made in connection with this notice. The Board's determination also is subject to all the terms and conditions set forth in Regulation Y, including those in sections 225.7 and 225.23(g) (12 C.F.R. 225.7 and 225.23(g)), and to the Board's authority to require such modification or termination of the activities of a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary to ensure compliance with, and to prevent evasions of, the provisions of the BHC Act and the Board's regulations and orders thereunder. For purposes of this transaction, the commitments and conditions relied on by the Board in reaching this decision are deemed to be conditions imposed in writing by the Board in connection with its findings and decision and, as such, may be enforced in proceedings under applicable law. The proposal shall not be consummated later than three months after the effective date of this order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board or the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, acting pursuant to delegated authority. By order of the Board of Governors, effective April 10, 1997. (signed) Jennifer J. Johnson Jennifer J. Johnson Deputy Secretary of the Board Footnotes The Notificants also have acquired an option to purchase up to 19.9ï¿½percent of the voting shares of Standard Federal under certain circumstances. This option would terminate on consummation of the proposal. Asset data are as of December 31, 1996, and use exchange rates then in effect. Deposit data are as of June 30, 1996. In this context, depository institutions include banks, savings and loan associations, and savings banks. 12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(9). Notificants have committed that all impermissible real estate activities will be divested or terminated within two years of consummation of the proposal, that no new impermissible projects or investments will be undertaken during this period, and that capital adequacy guidelines will be met, excluding impermissible real estate investments. Notificants also have committed that all impermissible insurance activities conducted by Standard Federal or its subsidiaries will cease within six months of consummation of the proposal, and Notificants have indicated that the activities will be divested to an unrelated third party or transferred to an affiliated national bank that is authorized by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to engage in the activities. In addition, Notificants have committed that all impermissible securities activities will cease on or before consummation of the proposal. 12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(15). 12 U.S.C. §ï¿½1843(c)(8). See 12 C.F.R. 225.24; see also The Fuji Bank, Limited, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 94 (1989); Bayerische Vereinsbank AG , 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 155 (1987). One of the Protestants asserts that press accounts about the U.S. activities of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (formally Algemene Bank Nederland, N.V.), the foreign parent holding company of ABN AMRO North America, Inc. (the "Foreign Parent"), raise adverse managerial issues. The Board has considered these comments in light of Notificants' extensive supervisory record in the United States, which includes examination reports by appropriate supervisory authorities, and actions taken by the Foreign Parent to enhance risk management at its U.S. trading operations. Protestants also refer to other events that occurred outside the United States involving the Foreign Parent, including two additional foreign underwriting transactions in which the Foreign Parent is alleged to have made inadequate or inaccurate disclosures to investors, alleged fraudulent activity by employees, and circumstances surrounding the recent resignation of a senior official. Protestants have requested that the Board hold a public hearing to receive additional evidence concerning the allegations about the Netherlands bond underwriting. Under the Board's rules, a hearing is required on a proposed acquisition of a savings association under section 4 of the BHC Act if there are disputed issues of material fact that cannot be resolved in some other manner. 12 C.F.R. 225.23(f). Protestants have not raised a disputed issue concerning a fact that is material to the Board's consideration of this notice and that cannot otherwise be resolved. The Board may also, in its discretion, hold a public hearing or meeting on a notice to clarify factual issues related to the notice and to provide an opportunity for testimony, if appropriate. 12 C.F.R. 262.3(e) and 12 C.F.R. 262.25(d). In the Board's view, the Protestants have had ample opportunity to present their views, and have, in fact, provided substantial written comments that have been considered by the Board in acting on this proposal. The Protestants failed to demonstrate why the written submissions are not adequate to present their views on the notice. After a careful review of all the facts of record, including all the comments on this proposal, the Board has determined that a public hearing or meeting is not necessary to clarify the factual record of the proposal and is not otherwise warranted in this case. Accordingly, the request for a public hearing on the notice is hereby denied. One of the Protestants has requested that the Board investigate Notificants and their management in light of the Protestant's allegations about illegal and unethical conduct by Notificants' employees and delay action on the proposal until the investigation is completed and the matter involving the Netherlands bond underwriting is resolved. The Board is required under the BHC Act to act on applications and notices within specified time periods. The Board notes, moreover, that Protestant has had a reasonable opportunity to comment as provided in the Board's notice processing procedures and has submitted substantial comments that have been carefully considered by the Board. Based on all the facts of record, and for the reasons discussed above, the Board concludes that the record is sufficient to act on the proposal at this time, and that delay or denial of the proposal on the grounds of informational insufficiency is not warranted. This action was taken pursuant to the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority (12 C.F.R. 265.4(b)(1)) by a committee of Board members. Voting for this action: Chairman Greenspan, Vice Chair Rivlin, and Governor Kelley.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board today announced its approval of the application of Amboy Bancorporation, Old Bridge, New Jersey, to acquire up to 9.9 percent of the shares of The Community Bank of New Jersey, Freehold, New Jersey, a de novo state-chartered bank. Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action. Amboy Bancorporation Old Bridge, New Jersey Order Approving the Acquisition of Shares in a De Novo Bank Amboy Bancorporation, Old Bridge, New Jersey, ("Amboy"), a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act ("BHC Act"), has requested the Board's approval under section 3 of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. § 1842) to acquire up to 9.9 percent of the shares of The Community Bank of New Jersey, Freehold, New Jersey ("CBNJ"), a de novo state-chartered bank. Notice of this proposal, affording interested persons an opportunity to submit comments, has been published (62 Federal Register 4534 (1997)). The time for filing comments has expired, and the Board has considered the proposal and all comments received in light of the factors set forth in section 3 of the BHC Act. Amboy, with total consolidated assets of $1.1 billion, is a registered bank holding company that operates one subsidiary bank in New Jersey. Amboy is the 13th largest commercial banking organization in New Jersey, controlling approximately $871.8 million in deposits, representing 1 percent of all deposits in commercial banking organizations in the state ("state deposits"). CBNJ, a de novo bank, would control a de minimis percentage of state deposits during its first few years of operation. Amboy proposes to acquire less than 25 percent of the voting shares of CBNJ, which is not a normal acquisition for a bank holding company. Nonetheless, the requirement in section 3(a)(3) of the BHC Act that the Board's approval be obtained before a bank holding company acquires more than 5 percent of the voting shares of a bank suggests that Congress contemplated the acquisition by bank holding companies of between 5 and 25 percent of the voting shares of a bank or bank holding company (a "minority investment"). Amboy contends that the proposed 9.9 percent minority investment would be passive and would not permit Amboy to control CBNJ. Amboy has provided a number of the commitments previously relied on by the Board in determining that minority investments would not permit the investing bank holding company to control another bank holding company or bank. Unlike other cases, however, Amboy proposes to engage in loan participation activities with CBNJ, and contends that this relationship should not raise control issues. A company may control a bank or other company for purposes of the BHC Act if the company is able to exercise a controlling influence over the management and policies of the bank or other company. The Board previously has concluded that a minority investment could permit the investing bank holding company to control another bank or bank holding company. Whether a minority investment could result in control necessarily requires a careful review of the proposal in light of all the facts of record. If control exists, the Board's regulations require the bank holding company to provide financial and managerial support to the bank or bank holding company it controls. The Board has in many prior cases noted its concern that a proposed minority investment could permit an investing bank holding company to exercise a controlling influence over the bank invested in when the investment is coupled with significant business relationships, particularly relationships involving a core banking function like lending. For example, an equity investor has both the means and the incentive to influence the lending policies of a company that is a significant partner in lending transactions to insure a certain amount of loan participations in connection with the bank's business plan. In addition, a company may be less willing to reject loans originated by an investor in the company or establish loan policies that conflict with the policies of a company that is a significant investor and source of business. In this case, Amboy Bank proposes to underwrite and originate real estate and construction loans in CBNJ's community with the expectation that CBNJ would participate in these loans. CBNJ is a de novo bank with no record of independent operations. Amboy has not proposed any limit to the amount of the assets of CBNJ that would represent loans originated or underwritten by Amboy, and the amount of such participation could therefore represent most or all of the loan portfolio of CBNJ during the next several years. The Board also has considered these proposed business relationships in light of the fact that Amboy would be the largest single shareholder of CBNJ and would be able to vote 9.9 percent of the bank's outstanding shares. CBNJ's shares are otherwise widely held, with no single shareholder owning in excess of five percent. Based on all the facts of record, and for the reasons discussed above, the Board concludes that Amboy would have the ability to exercise a controlling influence over the management and policies of CBNJ as a result of the proposal and, thereby, would control the bank for purposes of the BHC Act. Accordingly, the Board's action on the proposal is expressly conditioned on Amboy providing financial and managerial support for CBNJ in accordance with the Board's rules and policies. Amboy and CBNJ would compete in the Metropolitan New York/New Jersey banking market. Amboy is the 45th largest depository institution in the market, controlling approximately $871.8 million in deposits, representing less than 1 percent of total deposits in depository institutions in the market ("market deposits"). The market is unconcentrated, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index ("HHI"), and numerous competitors would remain in the market. Based on all the facts of record, the Board concludes that consummation of the proposal would not have a significantly adverse effect on competition or the concentration of resources in the Metropolitan New York/New Jersey banking market or any other relevant banking market. The Board also concludes in light of all the facts of record that the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved and the convenience and needs of the community to be served are consistent with approval as are other supervisory factors. Based on the foregoing and all the facts of record, the Board has determined that the application should be, and hereby is, approved. The Board's approval is expressly conditioned on compliance by Amboy with all the commitments made in connection with the proposal and with the conditions discussed in this order, including the condition that Amboy provide financial and managerial support to CBNJ in accordance with the Board's policies. For purposes of this action, the commitments and conditions relied on by the Board in reaching this decision are deemed to be conditions imposed in writing and, as such, may be enforced in proceedings under applicable law. The acquisition of shares in CBNJ should not be consummated before the fifteenth calendar day following the effective date of this order or later than three months following the effective date of this order, and CBNJ shall be opened for business within six months, unless such periods are extended for good cause by the Board or by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, acting pursuant to delegated authority. By order of the Board of Governors, effective April 14, 1997. (signed) William W. Wiles William W. Wiles Deputy Secretary of the Board Footnotes CBNJ would be capitalized through an initial public offering of voting stock, and Amboy proposes to purchase 9.9 percent of the voting shares. Amboy would also obtain a non-transferrable ten-year option to purchase additional CBNJ shares in future public offerings in order to maintain shareholdings at 9.9 percent. The option by its terms may not be exercised if the result would cause Amboy to own, in the aggregate, more than 9.9 percent of CBNJ's voting shares. Amboy owns Amboy National Bank, Old Bridge, New Jersey ("Amboy Bank"). Consolidated asset data are as of September 30, 1996. Banking asset data are as of December 31, 1996. State deposit data are as of June 30, 1996. CBNJ projects that its average deposit balances will reach $6 million during its first year in operation, and will reach $85 million by its fifth year in operation. See e.g., Summit Bancorp, Inc ., 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 952 (1991); The Summit Bancorporation , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 712 (1989); United Counties Bancorporation , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 714 (1989). For example, Amboy has committed not to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of CBNJ; not to have director, officer, or employee interlocks with CBNJ; not to solicit or participate in soliciting proxies with respect to any matter presented to the shareholders of CBNJ; and not to threaten to dispose of shares of CBNJ in any manner as a condition of specific action or nonaction by CBNJ. 12 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(2)(C). See McLeod Bancshares, Inc ., 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 724 (1987); Hudson Financial Associates , 72 Federal Reserve Bulletin 150 (1986). See, e.g. , 12 C.F.R. 225.4(a); Flathead Holding Company of Bigfork , 82 Federal Reserve Bulletin 741 (1996); see also 12 U.S.C. § 1815(e) (cross-guaranty provision of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act). See, e.g., Proposed Investment by Sumitomo Bank , 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 24 (1987). In a small number of proposals, the Board has concluded that a minority investment in combination with business relationships would not, in the specific circumstances of that case, result in the investing bank holding company controlling the second holding company. In those cases, each of the institutions involved were large commercial banking organizations with substantial assets and well-established records of independent operations, and the business relationships were limited. See BOK Financial Corporation , 81 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1052 (1995); Banco Santander, S.A. , 81 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1139 (1995). Although the bank's organizers would own approximately 46 percent of the bank's voting shares, the organizers consist of 31 individuals and there is no evidence in the record that the organizers are bound together as a cohesive group of shareholders that could counterbalance Amboy's voting power. CBNJ's remaining voting shares would be owned by approximately 270 individual shareholders. See 12 C.F.R. 225, Subpart D. The Metropolitan New York-New Jersey banking market is approximated by Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union and Warren Counties and parts of Mercer County in New Jersey; Bronx, Dutchess, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Putnam, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester Counties in New York; Pike County, Pennsylvania; and 24 municipalities in Fairfield and Litchfield Counties in Connecticut. Market share data are as of June 30, 1995. Market share data are based on calculations in which the deposits of thrift institutions are included at 50 percent. The Board has indicated previously that thrift institutions have become, or have the potential to become, major competitors of commercial banks. See WM Bancorp , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 788 (1990); National City Corporation , 70 Federal Reserve Bulletin 743 (1984). In light of the de novo formation of CBNJ, the HHI would remain unchanged at 748 after consummation of the proposal. Under the revised Department of Justice Merger Guidelines, 49 Federal Register 26,823 (June 29, 1984), a market in which the post-merger HHI is less than 1000 is unconcentrated. The Justice Department has informed the Board that a bank merger or acquisition generally will not be challenged (in the absence of other factors indicating anticompetitive effects) unless the post-merger HHI is at least 1800 and the merger increases the HHI by more than 200 points. The Justice Department has stated that the higher than normal HHI thresholds for screening bank mergers for anticompetitive effects implicitly recognize the competitive effect of limited-purpose lenders and other non-depository financial entities. Voting for this action: Chairman Greenspan, Vice Chair Rivlin, and Governors Kelley, Phillips, and Meyer.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board today announced its approval of the applications of AmSouth Bank of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama, to merge with AmSouth Bank of Florida, Tampa, Florida; AmSouth Bank of Georgia, Rome, Georgia; AmSouth Bank of Tennessee, Chattanooga, Tennessee; and AmSouth Bank of Walker County, Jasper, Alabama; and to establish branch offices. Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action. AmSouth Bank of Alabama Birmingham, Alabama Order Approving the Merger of Banks and Establishment of Bank Branches AmSouth Bank of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama ("AmSouth Alabama"), a state member bank, has applied under section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12ï¿½U.S.C. ï¿½ 1828(c)) (the "Bank Merger Act") to merge with AmSouth Bank of Florida, Tampa, Florida ("AmSouth Florida"); AmSouth Bank of Georgia, Rome, Georgia ("AmSouth Georgia"); AmSouth Bank of Tennessee, Chattanooga, Tennessee ("AmSouth Tennessee"); and AmSouth Bank of Walker County, Jasper, Alabama ("AmSouth Walker") (collectively, the "Merging Banks"); with AmSouth Alabama as the survivor. AmSouth Alabama also has applied under sectionï¿½9 of the Federal Reserve Act (12ï¿½U.S.C.ï¿½ï¿½ 321) to establish branches at the current locations of the main offices and branches of the Merging Banks. Notice of the application, affording interested persons an opportunity to submit comments, has been given in accordance with the Bank Merger Act and the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 C.F.R. 262.3(b)). As required by the Bank Merger Act, reports on the competitive effects of the merger were requested from the United States Attorney General, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The time for filing comments has expired, and the Board has considered the application and all the facts of record in light of the factors set forth in the Bank Merger Act and section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act. AmSouth Alabama and the Merging Banks are wholly owned subsidiaries of AmSouth Bancorporation, Birmingham, Alabama ("AmSouth"). AmSouth is the third largest commercial banking organization in Alabama, controlling deposits of $6.8 billion, representing 15.7 percent of the total deposits in commercial banking organizations in Alabama; the fifth largest commercial banking organization in Florida, controlling deposits of $5.1ï¿½billion, representing 3.3 percent of the total deposits in commercial banking organizations in Florida; the twenty-first largest commercial banking organization in Georgia, controlling deposits of $275.6 million, representing less than 1 percent of the total deposits in commercial banking organizations in Georgia; and the eighth largest commercial banking organization in Tennessee, controlling deposits of $827.5 million, representing 1.5ï¿½percent of the total deposits in commercial banking organizations in Tennessee. This proposal represents a reorganization of AmSouth's existing banking operations, and therefore, consummation of the proposal would not have any significantly adverse effects on competition in any relevant banking market. Riegle-Neal Act Analysis Section 102 of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ("Riegle-Neal Act") (Pub. L. No. 103-328, 108ï¿½Stat.ï¿½2338 (1994)) authorizes banks, beginning on June 1, 1997, to conduct interstate mergers unless, prior to June 1, 1997, the home State of one of the banks involved in the transaction has adopted a law expressly prohibiting merger transactions involving out-of-state banks. The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes the acquiring bank to retain and operate, as a main office or branch, any bank offices of the acquired bank. All the states involved in this proposal, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee, have enacted legislation allowing interstate mergers between banks located in their states and out-of-state banks pursuant to the provisions of the Riegle-Neal Act on or after Juneï¿½1, 1997. Alabama Bank has notified the Alabama Superintendent of Banks, the Florida State Comptroller, the Georgia Commissioner, and the Tennessee Commissioner regarding its proposal to consolidate its banking operations and provided a copy of its Bank Merger Act application to all the relevant state agencies. Representatives from all the states involved in the proposal have indicated that this transaction would be in compliance with their state laws regarding interstate bank mergers. In light of the foregoing, it appears that the proposal complies with the requirements of the Riegle-Neal Act provided that the proposal is not consummated prior to Juneï¿½1,ï¿½1997. Financial, Managerial and Other Supervisory Factors The Bank Merger Act also requires the Board to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions, and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. The Board has carefully considered the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of AmSouth Alabama and the Merging Banks in light of all the facts of record. The facts of record include supervisory reports of examination assessing the financial and managerial resources of the organizations and financial information provided by AmSouth. Based on these and all other facts of record, the Board concludes that all the supervisory factors under the Bank Merger Act are consistent with approval. The Board also has carefully considered the effect of the proposal on the convenience and needs of the communities to be served in light of all the facts of record. The Board has long held that consideration of the convenience and needs factor includes a review of the records of the relevant depository institutions under the Community Reinvestment Act (12 U.S.C. ï¿½ 2901 et seq .) ("CRA"). As provided in the CRA, the Board evaluates this factor in light of examinations by the primary federal supervisor of the CRA performance records of the relevant institutions. An institution's most recent CRA performance evaluation is a particularly important consideration in the applications process because it represents a detailed on-site evaluation of the institution's overall record of performance under the CRA by its primary federal supervisor. AmSouth Alabama and all the banks involved in the proposal received "satisfactory" ratings at their most recent examination of their CRA performance by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, as of Octoberï¿½7,ï¿½1996. Based on all the facts of record, including the results of the relevant CRA performance examinations, the Board concludes that considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the communities served are consistent with approval. The Board also concludes that all the factors that must be considered under the Reigle-Neal Act and the Federal Reserve Act also are consistent with approval. Conclusion Based on the foregoing and all the facts of record, the Board has determined that this application should be approved. Because the provisions of the Riegle-Neal Act relied on for this determination do not become effective until Juneï¿½1,ï¿½1997, the Board's action approving the proposal shall not be effective until Juneï¿½1, 1997. The Board's approval of the proposal is conditioned on compliance by AmSouth Alabama with all the commitments made in connection with this application. For purposes of this action, the commitments and conditions relied on in reaching this decision are both conditions imposed in writing by the Board and, as such, may be enforced in proceedings under applicable law. The merger of the Merging Banks with and into AmSouth Alabama may not be consummated before the fifteenth day following the June 1, 1997, effective date of this order, or later than three months after the effective date of this order, unless such period is extended by the Board or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, acting pursuant to delegated authority.

For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board today announced its approval of the application of Crestar Financial Corporation to engage de novo through its subsidiary, Crestar Securities Corporation, both of Richmond, Virginia, in private placement and "riskless principal" activities, and underwriting and dealing in, to a limited extent, certain bank-ineligible securities. Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action. Crestar Financial Corporation Richmond, Virginia Order Approving a Notice to Engage in Certain Nonbanking Activities Crestar Financial Corporation, Richmond, Virginia ("Applicant"), a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company ("BHC") Act, has requested the Board's approval under sectionï¿½4(c)(8) of the BHC Act (12ï¿½U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½1843(c)(8)) and section 225.23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12ï¿½C.F.R. 225.23) to engage de novo in the following nonbanking activities through its wholly owned subsidiary, Crestar Securities Corporation, Richmond, Virginia ("Company"): (1) Underwriting and dealing in, to a limited extent, certain municipal revenue bonds (including certain unrated and "private ownership" municipal revenue bonds), 1-4 family mortgage-related securities, consumer receivable-related securities, and commercial paper (collectively, "bank-ineligible securities"); and (2) Acting as agent in the private placement of all types of securities, and buying and selling all types of securities on the order of customers as a "riskless principal." Notice of the proposal, affording interested persons an opportunity to submit comments, has been published (62 Federal Register 7784 (1997)). The time for filing comments has expired, and the Board has considered the notice and all comments received in light of the factors set forth in sectionï¿½4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. Applicant, with total consolidated assets of approximately $18.8ï¿½billion, is the 43rd largest banking organization in the United States. Applicant owns one commercial bank subsidiary that operates in Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia and engages, through other subsidiaries, in various permissible nonbanking activities. Company is, and will continue to be, registered as a broker-dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15ï¿½U.S.C. ï¿½ 78a et seq .) and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"). Accordingly, Company is, and will continue to be, subject to the recordkeeping and reporting obligations, fiduciary standards, and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC, and the NASD. Underwriting and Dealing in Bank-Ineligible Securities The Board previously has determined that, subject to the prudential framework of limitations established in previous decisions to address the potential for conflicts of interests, unsound banking practices, or other adverse effects ("section 20 firewalls"), the proposed activities of underwriting and dealing in bank-ineligible securities are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto within the meaning of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. Applicant has committed that Company will conduct these underwriting and dealing activities using the same methods and procedures and subject to the same prudential limitations established by the Board in the Section 20 Orders. The Board also has previously concluded that underwriting and dealing in "private ownership" industrial development bonds that qualify as "exempt facility bonds" under section 142 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code") is a permissible activity under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. Company will conduct this activity according to the prudential limitations set forth in the Sectionï¿½20 Orders. In addition, the Board has determined that the conduct of the securities underwriting and dealing activities proposed by Applicant is consistent with sectionï¿½20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. ï¿½ 377), provided that the company engaged in the underwriting and dealing activities derives no more than 25 percent of its total gross revenues from underwriting and dealing in bank-ineligible securities over any two-year period. Applicant has committed that Company will conduct its bank-ineligible securities underwriting and dealing activities subject to the Board's revenue test. Private Placement and "Riskless Principal" Activities Private placement involves the placement of new issues of securities with a limited number of sophisticated purchasers in a nonpublic offering. A financial intermediary in a private placement transaction acts solely as an agent of the issuer in soliciting purchasers and does not purchase the securities and attempt to resell them. Securities that are privately placed are not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and are offered only to financially sophisticated institutions and individuals and not to the public. Company will not privately place registered securities and will only place securities with customers that qualify as accredited investors. "Riskless principal" is the term used in the securities business to refer to a transaction in which a broker-dealer, after receiving an order to buy (or sell) a security for a customer, purchases (or sells) the security for its own account to offset a contemporaneous sale to (or purchase from) the customer. A broker-dealer acting as a riskless principal is not obligated to enter into a transaction with its customer until after the broker-dealer executes the offsetting transaction for its own account. Riskless principal transactions are understood in the industry to include only transactions in the secondary market. Thus, Company would not act as a riskless principal in selling bank-ineligible securities at the order of a customer that is the issuer of the securities to be sold, or in any transaction where Company has a contractual agreement to place the securities as agent of the issuer. Company also would not act as a riskless principal in any transaction involving a bank-ineligible security for which it or an affiliate makes a market. The Board has determined that, subject to the limitations established by the Board in prior orders, the proposed private placement and riskless principal activities are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto within the meaning of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. The Board also has determined that acting as agent in the private placement of securities, and purchasing and selling securities on the order of investors as a riskless principal, do not constitute underwriting and dealing in securities for purposes of section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, and, therefore, that revenue derived from these activities is not subject to the revenue limitation on bank-ineligible securities underwriting and dealing activities. Applicant has committed that Company will conduct its private placement activities using the same methods and procedures and subject to the same prudential limitations as those established by the Board in Bankers Trust and J.P. Morgan , including the comprehensive framework of restrictions imposed by the Board in connection with underwriting and dealing in bank-ineligible securities, which were designed to avoid potential conflicts of interests, unsound banking practices, and other adverse effects. Applicant also has committed that Company will conduct its riskless principal activities subject to the limitations previously established by the Board. Among the limitations discussed more fully in Bank of New York and the Riskless Principal Order , Applicant has committed that Company will not act as riskless principal for registered investment company securities or for any securities of investment companies that are advised by Applicant or any of its affiliates. Also, neither Company nor its affiliates will hold themselves out as making a market in the bank-ineligible securities that Company buys and sells as riskless principal, or enter quotes for specific bank-ineligible securities in any dealer quotation system in connection with Company's riskless principal transactions, except that Company and its affiliates may enter bid or ask quotations, or publish "offering wanted" or "bid wanted" notices on trading systems other than NASDAQ or an exchange, if Company or an affiliate does not enter price quotations on different sides of the market for a particular security for two business days. Other Considerations In order to approve this notice, the Board also must determine that the proposed activities are a proper incident to banking, that is that the proposal "can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices." As part of the Board's evaluation of these factors, the Board considers the financial and managerial resources of the notificant and its subsidiaries and the effect the transaction would have on such resources. The Board has reviewed the capitalization of Applicant and Company in accordance with the standards set forth in the Section 20 Orders and finds the capitalization of each to be consistent with approval. The determination of the capitalization of Company is based on all the facts of record, including Applicant's projections of the volume of Company's underwriting and dealing activities in bank-ineligible securities. Based on all the facts of record, the Board has concluded that financial and managerial considerations are consistent with approval of the notice. As noted above, Applicant has committed that Company will conduct its bank-ineligible securities underwriting and dealing activities in accordance with the prudential framework established by the Board's Section 20 Orders. The Board has concluded that, under the framework and conditions established in this order and prior orders, Company's conduct of the proposed limited securities underwriting and dealing, private placement, and riskless principal activities is not likely to result in significantly adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices. The Board expects, moreover, that the de novo entry of Company into the market for the proposed services would provide added convenience to Applicant's customers, would lead to improved methods of meeting customer financing needs, and would increase the level of competition among providers of these services. The Board has determined, therefore, that the performance of the proposed activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects under the proper incident to banking standard of sectionï¿½4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth in this order and in the Section 20 Orders, the Board has concluded that Applicant's proposal to engage in the proposed activities is consistent with the Glass-Steagall Act, and that the proposed activities are so closely related to banking as to be proper incidents thereto within the meaning of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act, provided that Applicant limits Company's activities as specified in this order, the Sectionï¿½20 Orders (as modified by the Modification Orders), and the other orders referenced herein. Based on all the facts of record, and subject to the commitments made by Applicant, as well as the terms and conditions set forth in this order and in the Board orders noted above, the Board has determined that the notice should be, and hereby is, approved. The Board's approval of the proposal extends only to the activities conducted within the limitations of those orders and this order, including the Board's reservation of authority to establish additional limitations to ensure that Company's activities are consistent with safety and soundness, avoidance of conflicts of interests, and other relevant considerations under the BHC Act. Underwriting and dealing in any manner other than as approved in this order and the Section 20 Orders, as modified by the Modification Orders, is not authorized for Company. The Board's determination also is subject to all the terms and conditions set forth in Regulation Y, including those in sections 225.7 and 225.23(g) of Regulation Y (12 C.F.R. 225.7 and 225.23(g)), and to the Board's authority to require such modification or termination of the activities of a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary to ensure compliance with, and to prevent evasion of, the provisions of the BHC Act and the Board's regulations and orders issued thereunder. The Board's decision is specifically conditioned on compliance by Applicant and Company with all the commitments made in connection with the notice, including the commitments referenced in this order and the Board's regulations and orders noted above. These commitments and conditions shall be deemed to be conditions imposed in writing by the Board in connection with its findings and decision, and, as such, may be enforced in proceedings under applicable law. This transaction shall not be consummated later than three months after the effective date of this order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board or the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, acting pursuant to delegated authority. By order of the Board of Governors, effective April 14, 1997. (signed) Jennifer J. Johnson Jennifer J. Johnson Deputy Secretary of the Board Footnotes Asset and ranking data are as of December 31, 1996. Company currently engages in a variety of permissible nonbanking activities including lending, advisory, leasing, and securities brokerage activities and underwriting and dealing in obligations of the Unitedï¿½States, general obligations of states and their political subdivisions, and other obligations that state member banks may underwrite and deal in under 12 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 335 and 24(7). See 12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(1), (4), (5), (15), and (16). Company also engages in insurance agency activities pursuant to section 225.25(b)(8)(vii) of the Board's Regulation Y ("Exemption G"). Exemption G is one of seven specific exemptions enacted by Title VI of the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 to that Act's general prohibition on insurance activities by bank holding companies. The exemption authorizes those bank holding companies that engaged in insurance agency activities prior to 1971 with prior Board approval to engage or control a company engaged in insurance agency activities. See Citicorp et al. , 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 473 (1987), aff'd sub nom. Securities Industry Ass'n v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , 839 F.2d 47 (2d Cir.), cert. denied , 486 U.S. 1059 (1988), as modified by Review of Restrictions on Director, Officer and Employee Interlocks, Cross-Marketing Activities, and the Purchase and Sale of Financial Assets Between a Section 20 Subsidiary and an Affiliated Bank or Thrift , 61ï¿½ Federal Register 57,679 (1996) (collectively, "Section 20 Orders"). To address potential conflicts of interests arising from Company's conduct of full-service brokerage activities together with underwriting and dealing in bank-ineligible securities, Applicant has committed that Company will inform its full-service brokerage customers at the commencement of the relationship that, as a general matter, Company may be a principal or may be engaged in underwriting with respect to, or may purchase from an affiliate, those securities for which brokerage and advisory services are provided. In addition, at the time any brokerage order is taken, the customer will be informed (usually orally) whether Company is acting as agent or principal with respect to a security. Confirmations sent to customers also will state whether Company is acting as agent or principal. See PNC Financial Corp ., 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 396 (1989). See 26 U.S.C. ï¿½ 142. See The Bank of New York Company, Inc ., 82 Federal Reserve Bulletin 748 (1996) (" Bank of New York "); Bank South Corporation , 81ï¿½Federal Reserve Bulletin 1116 (1995). In addition to the private ownership bonds discussed in these previous orders, Applicant proposes that Company be permitted to engage to a limited extent in underwriting and dealing in private ownership bonds that are issued for the following traditional government services: qualified residential rental projects, qualified hazardous waste facilities, and environmental enhancements for existing hydroelectric generating facilities, all of which qualify as "exempt facility bonds" under the Code. Exempt facility bonds are issued to finance the acquisition or construction of facilities that provide certain types of traditional government services. In connection with its proposal to underwrite and deal in unrated municipal revenue bonds, including unrated public ownership and "private ownership" industrial development bonds, Applicant has committed that Company will not underwrite any unrated municipal revenue bonds until Company conducts an independent credit review to determine that the securities are of investment grade quality and that no single issue of unrated municipal revenue bonds, including unrated public ownership and "private ownership" industrial development bonds, underwritten by Company would exceed $7.5ï¿½million. Applicant also has provided other commitments previously relied upon by the Board in authorizing a sectionï¿½20 company to engage to a limited extent in underwriting and dealing in unrated municipal revenue bonds. See Section 20 Orders. Effective March 6, 1997, the Board increased from 10 percent to 25 percent the proportion of total revenue that a section 20 subsidiary may derive from underwriting and dealing in bank-ineligible securities. See Revenue Limit on Bank-Ineligible Activities of Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies Engaged in Underwriting and Dealing in Securities , 61 Federal Register 68,750 (1996). Compliance with the revenue limitation shall be calculated in accordance with the method stated in the Section 20 Orders, as modified by the Order Approving Modifications to Section 20 Orders , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 751 (1989), and 10 Percent Revenue Limit on Bank-Ineligible Activities of Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies Engaged in Underwriting and Dealing in Securities , 61 Federal Register 48,953 (1996) (collectively, "Modification Orders"). Company also may engage in activities that are necessary incidents to the proposed underwriting and dealing activities. Unless Company receives specific approval under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act to conduct the activities independently, any revenues from the incidental activities must be counted as ineligible revenues subject to the Board's revenue limitation. See SEC Rule 10b-10(a)(8)(i) (17 C.F.R. 240.10b-10(a)(8)(i)). The Board notes that Company, as a registered broker-dealer, must conduct its riskless principal activities in accordance with the customer disclosure and other requirements of federal securities laws and regulations. See J.P. Morgan & Company Incorporated , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 26 (1990) (" J.P. Morgan "); Bankers Trust New York Corporation , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 829 (1989) (" Bankers Trust "). See Bankers Trust. Among the prudential limitations discussed more fully in Bankers Trust and J.P. Morgan are that Company will not privately place open-end investment company securities or securities of investment companies that are advised by Applicant or any of its affiliates. In addition, Company will make no general solicitation or general advertising for securities it places. See Bank of New York ; Order Revising the Limitations Applicable to Riskless Principal Activities , 82 Federal Reserve Bulletin 759 (1996) (" Riskless Principal Order "). Effective Aprilï¿½21, 1997, the proposed private placement and riskless principal activities will be included in the "laundry list" of nonbanking activities permissible for bank holding companies that is set forth in Regulation Y. See 62 Federal Register 9290 (1997) (to be codified at 12ï¿½C.F.R. 225.28(b)(7)(ii) and (iii)). Accordingly, from and after that date, Company may engage in such activities subject only to those conditions set forth in Regulation Y, as amended. 12 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½1843(c)(8). See 12 C.F.R. 225.24.

Shoreline Financial Corporation Benton Harbor, Michigan Order Approving the Acquisition of a Savings Association Shoreline Financial Corporation, Benton Harbor, Michigan ("Shoreline"), a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act ("BHC Act"), has requested the Board's approval under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act (12ï¿½U.S.C. §ï¿½1843(c)(8)) and section 225.24 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 C.F.R. 225.24) to acquire: (1) SJS Bancorp, Inc., St. Joseph, Michigan, and its wholly owned subsidiary, SJS Federal Savings Bank ("SJS Bank"), and thereby engage in operating a savings association; and (2) SJS Financial Corporation, a nonbanking subsidiary of SJS Bank, and thereby engage in the reinsurance of life insurance that is limited to insuring the repayment of the outstanding balance due on mortgages made by SJS Bank on the death of the mortgagor ("credit-related life insurance"). Notice of the proposal, affording interested persons an opportunity to submit comments, has been published (62 Federal Register 8960 (1997)). The time for filing comments has expired, and the Board has considered the proposal and all comments received in light of the factors set forth in sectionï¿½4(c)(8)ï¿½of the BHC Act. The Board previously has determined by regulation that operating a savings association and acting as a principal for credit-related life insurance are activities closely related to banking for purposes of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. The Board requires savings associations acquired by bank holding companies to conform their direct and indirect activities to those permissible for bank holding companies under section 4 of the BHC Act and Regulation Y. Shoreline has indicated that SJS Bank does not engage in any activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies under the BHC Act. Shoreline is the 19th largest depository institution in Michigan, controlling deposits of $605.9 million, representing less than 1 percent of total deposits in depository institutions in the state. SJS Bancorp is the 65th largest depository institution in the state, controlling deposits of $110.2 million. On consummation of the proposal, Shoreline would become the 15th largest depository institution in Michigan, controlling total deposits of $716.1 million, representing less than 1 percent of the total deposits in depository institutions in the state. Competitive Considerations Under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act, the Board is required to consider whether a proposal is likely to result in public benefits that outweigh any significantly adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices. As part of this consideration, the Board weighs the effects of the proposal on competition in the relevant markets. Shoreline's bank subsidiary, Shoreline Bank, Benton Harbor, Michigan ("Shoreline Bank"), and SJS Bank compete directly in the Benton Harbor-St. Joseph banking market ("Benton Harbor banking market"). Shoreline Bank is the largest depository institution in the Benton Harbor banking market, controlling deposits of approximately $388.7 million, representing 30.5 percent of total deposits in depository institutions in the market ("market deposits"). SJS Bank is the fifth largest depository institution in the market, controlling deposits of approximately $110.2 million, representing 4.3 percent of market deposits. On consummation of this proposal, Shoreline would control deposits of approximately $498.9 million, representing 37.5 percent of market deposits. Market concentration, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index ("HHI"), would increase by 376 points to 2348 points. The market indexes in this case exceed the levels suggested in the DOJ Guidelines for identifying cases that ordinarily would not have a significantly adverse effect on competition. As the Board has previously indicated, HHI levels are only guidelines that are used by the Board, the Department of Justice, and other banking agencies to help identify cases in which a more detailed competitive analysis is appropriate to assure that the proposal would not have a significantly adverse effect on competition in any relevant market. A proposal that fails to pass the HHI market screen may nonetheless be approved because other information may indicate that the proposal would not have a significantly adverse effect on competition. A number of considerations indicate that the market concentration as measured by the HHI tends to overstate the competitive effects of this proposal. After consummation of the proposal, for example, twelve depository institutions would remain in the market. Six of these competitors are multi-billion dollar banking organizations. In addition, three of the remaining competitors would each control significant percentages of market deposits. Several factors also indicate that the Benton Harbor banking market is attractive for entry. Five new entries into the market have occurred within the last 18 months. Three of the new entries (two by acquisition and one de novo ) were for the purpose of entering the market and were not incidental to an acquisition in another market. In addition, the Benton Harbor banking market comprises parts of two Michigan Metropolitan Statistical Areas ("MSA") that have characteristics that make them attractive for entry to potential competitors. From 1990 to 1994, the population in the Benton Harbor banking market increased at a higher rate than the statewide rate, and the percentage increase in the amount of deposits in the Benton Harbor banking market during the same period was substantially higher than the percentage increase in market deposits for MSA and non-MSA banking markets in the state. Moreover, legal barriers to entry into banking markets are low in Michigan. The Board also has considered the competitive effect of credit unions operating in the Benton Harbor banking market. Seven credit unions control approximately 14.3 percent of the market deposits and offer a full range of retail banking products. The largest credit union, which controls approximately $129 million in deposits, representing approximately 8 percent of market deposits, would be the fourth largest depository institution in the market. The Department of Justice has reviewed the proposal and advised the Board that consummation of the proposal would not have a significantly adverse effect on competition in the Benton Harbor banking market or any other relevant banking market. Based on these and all the other facts of record, the Board concludes that consummation of this proposal is not likely to have a significantly adverse effect on competition or on the concentration of banking resources in the Benton Harbor banking market, or any other relevant banking market. Other Considerations The Board also concludes that consummation of the proposal would result in a broader financial network through which Shoreline could serve its customers and SJS Bank customers. SJS Bank customers would have access to increased services, including trust services, basic checking accounts for senior citizens, and extended banking hours. In addition, Shoreline's commercial lending services and higher lending limits would become available to customers of SJS Bank. The Board also concludes that the financial and managerial resources of Shoreline and SJS Bancorp are consistent with approval of the proposal. In light of all the facts of record, the Board finds that consummation of the proposal is not likely to result in any significantly adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices that would outweigh the public benefits of the proposal. Accordingly, the Board has determined that the Shoreline proposal can reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects under the proper incident to banking standard of sectionï¿½4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. Based on the foregoing and all the facts of record, the Board has determined that the notice should be, and hereby is approved. The Board's approval of the notice is specifically conditioned on compliance by Shoreline and SJS Bancorp with commitments made in connection with this notice. The Board's determination also is subject to all the terms and conditions set forth in Regulation Y, including those in sections 225.7 and 225.25(c) (12 C.F.R. 225.7 and 225.25(c)), and to the Board's authority to require such modification or termination of the activities of a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary to ensure compliance with, or to prevent evasion of, the provisions of the BHC Act and the Board's regulations and orders issued thereunder. For purposes of this transaction, the commitments and conditions relied on by the Board in reaching this decision are deemed to be conditions imposed in writing by the Board in connection with its findings and decision, and as such may be enforced in proceedings under applicable law. This proposal shall not be consummated later than three months after the effective date of this order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, acting pursuant to delegated authority. By order of the Board of Governors, effective April 21, 1997. (signed) Jennifer J. Johnson Jennifer J. Johnson Deputy Secretary of the Board Footnotes 12 C.F.R. 225.28(b)(4)(ii) and (b)(11). Shoreline would conduct thrift insurance activity in accordance with the Board's regulations. Deposit data are as of June 30, 1996. In this context, the term depository institutions includes commercial banks, savings banks, and savings associations. The Benton Harbor banking market is approximated by Van Buren County, Michigan, excluding the western townships of Bloomingdale, Pine Grove, Waverly, Almena, Paw Paw, Antwerp, Decatur, and Porter; plus the northwestern portion of Berrien County, Michigan, including the townships of Watervliet, Coloma, Hagar, Bainbridge, Benton, St. Joseph, Pipestone, Sodus, Royalton, Lincoln, Baroda, Lake and Chikaming. Market share data are as of June 30, 1996, and take into account proposals approved by the Board through April 15, 1997. The data are based on calculations in which the deposits of thrift institutions are included at 50ï¿½percent. The Board previously has indicated that thrift institutions have become, or have the potential to become, significant competitors of commercial banks. See Midwest Financial Group , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 386 (1989); National City Corporation , 70 Federal Reserve Bulletin 743 (1984). Thus, the Board has regularly included thrift deposits in the calculation of market share on a 50-percent weighted basis. See, e.g., First Hawaiian, Inc. , 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 52 (1991). Because the deposits of SJS Bank would be acquired by a commercial banking organization under the proposal, those deposits are included at 100 percent in the calculation of Shoreline's pro forma market share. See Norwest Corporation , 78 Federal Reserve Bulletin 452 (1992). First Banks, Inc. , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 669, 670 n.9.(1990). Under the revised Department of Justice Merger Guidelines, 49ï¿½ Federal Register 26,823 (June 29, 1984), a market in which the post-merger HHI is greater than 1800 is considered highly concentrated. The Justice Department has informed the Board that a bank merger or acquisition generally will not be challenged (in the absence of other factors indicating anticompetitive effects) unless the post-merger HHI is at least 1800 and the merger increases the HHI by more than 200 points. The Justice Department has stated that the higher than normal threshold for an increase in the HHI when screening bank mergers and acquisitions for anticompetitive effects implicitly recognizes the competitive effects of limited-purpose lenders and other non-depository financial entities. Three competitors would control 26.4 percent, 14.1ï¿½percent, and 9.6 percent of the market deposits. These two MSAs are the Berrien County MSA and the Van Buren County MSA. The per capita income of residents in the Berrien County MSA has increased more than the average increase in other Michigan MSAs. The Van Buren County MSA has experienced an above average increase in deposits, population, and profitability for banking organizations as compared to other Michigan MSAs. The sources for the data on this banking market, all per capita income, and other Michigan information are as follows, respectively: Department of Commerce, US Bureau of the Census, Press Release CB95-179, Population Distribution and Population Estimates Branches (October 2, 1995); Bureau of Economic Analysis, Survey of Current Business, "Local Area Personal Income", April 1994 and June 1996; and Department of Commerce, US Bureau of the Census, Press Release CB96-224, Population Estimates Program, Population Division (December 30, 1996). Michigan permits statewide de novo branching and permits the acquisition of both existing branches and de novo branches by out-of-state banks on a reciprocal basis. Mich. Stat. Ann. § 23.710 (122), (171) (Law Co-op. Supp. May 1996). The Board notes that the market for mortgage life insurance is national in scope and that there are numerous competitors in the market.

For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board announced today its approval of the application by G.B. Financial Services, Inc., Greenbush, to merge with Border Bancshares, Inc., Greenbush, and thereby acquire Border State Bank, Roseau, all in Minnesota. Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action. G.B. Financial Services, Inc. Greenbush, Minnesota Order Approving the Merger of Bank Holding Companies G.B. Financial Services, Inc., Greenbush ("G.B. Financial"), a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act ("BHC Act"), has requested the Board's approval under sectionï¿½3 of the BHC Act (12ï¿½U.S.C. §ï¿½1842) to merge with Border Bancshares, Inc., Greenbush ("Border Bancshares"), and thereby acquire Border State Bank, Roseau ("Border Bank"), all in Minnesota. Notice of the proposal, affording interested persons an opportunity to submit comments, has been published (62 Federal Register 2368 (1997)). The time for filing comments has expired, and the Board has considered the application and all comments received in light of the factors set forth in sectionï¿½3 of the BHC Act. G.B. Financial, with total consolidated assets of $38.2ï¿½million, operates one subsidiary bank, Border State Bank of Greenbush, Greenbush, Minnesota ("Greenbush Bank"). G.B. Financial is the 204th largest commercial banking organization in Minnesota, controlling deposits of approximately $30.2ï¿½million, representing less than 1ï¿½percent of total deposits in commercial banks in the state. Border Bancshares is the 238th largest depository institution in Minnesota, controlling deposits of approximately $26.7ï¿½million, representing less than 1ï¿½percent of total deposits in commercial banking organizations in the state. On consummation of this proposal, G.B.ï¿½Financial would become the 112th largest commercial banking organization in Minnesota, controlling approximately $56.9ï¿½million in deposits, representing less than 1ï¿½percent of total deposits in commercial banking organizations in the state. G.B. Financial and Border Bancshares compete directly in the Roseau, Minnesota, banking market ("Roseau banking market"). Greenbush Bank is the third largest of four commercial banks in the Roseau banking market, controlling deposits of $30.2ï¿½million, representing 15.3 percent of total deposits in commercial banking organizations in the market ("market deposits"). Border Bank is the fourth largest bank in the market, controlling deposits of $26.7ï¿½million, representing 13.5ï¿½percent of market deposits. On consummation, Greenbush Bank and Border Bank would control total deposits of $56.9ï¿½million, representing 28.8ï¿½percent of market deposits. The market, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index ("HHI"), is and would remain highly concentrated. In accordance with the BHC Act, the Board sought comments from the Department of Justice on the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant banking market. The Department of Justice has advised the Board that consummation of the proposal would not likely have any significantly adverse effects on competition in the Roseau banking market or any relevant banking market. The FDIC also has not objected to the proposal. G.B. Financial and Border Bancshares have a long history of affiliation through individual shareholders, and are under the control of the same individual shareholders. Based on all the facts of record, including the history of affiliation and the System's prior reviews, and the financial support provided by the common shareholders to the banks involved, the Board does not believe that the proposal is likely to have a significantly adverse effect on competition or on the concentration of banking resources in the Roseau banking market, or any other relevant banking market. The BHC Act also requires the Board to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved, the convenience and needs of the community to be served, and certain other supervisory factors. The Board has carefully reviewed the factors in light of all the facts of record, including relevant supervisory reports of examination. The Board concludes that the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the institutions involved in this proposal, and considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, are consistent with approval, as are the other supervisory factors the Board must consider under section 3 of the BHC Act. Based on the foregoing and all the facts of record, the Board has determined that the application should be, and hereby is, approved. The Board's approval of the proposal is conditioned on compliance by G.B.ï¿½Financial with the commitments made in connection with this application. The commitments and conditions relied on by the Board in reaching this decision shall be deemed to be conditions imposed in writing by the Board in connection with its findings and decision, and, as such, may be enforced in proceedings under applicable law. The acquisition shall not be consummated before the fifteenth calendar day following the effective date of this order, or later than three months after the effective date of this order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board or the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, acting pursuant to delegated authority. By order of the Board of Governors, effective April 21, 1997. (signed) Jennifer J. Johnson Jennifer J. Johnson Deputy Secretary of the Board Footnotes After the merger, G.B. Financial will change its name to Border Bancshares, Inc. Asset data are as of December 31, 1996. State deposit data are as of June 30, 1996. The Roseau banking market is approximated by Roseau County, Minnesota. No savings associations operate in the market. Market data are as of June 30, 1996. The HHI would increase by 414 points to 3769. Under the revised Department of Justice Merger Guidelines, 49 Federal Register 26,823 (1984), a market in which the post-merger HHI is above 1800 is considered highly concentrated. The Department of Justice has informed the Board that a bank merger or acquisition generally will not be challenged (in the absence of other factors indicating anticompetitive effects) unless the post-merger HHI is at least 1800 and the merger increases the HHI by more than 200 points. The Justice Department has stated that the higher than normal HHI thresholds for screening bank mergers for anticompetitive effects implicitly recognize the competitive effects of limited-purpose lenders and other non-depository institutions. Common shareholders own a substantial majority in each organization -- 77.4ï¿½percent of G.B. Financial and 97.3ï¿½percent of Border Bancshares -- and both organizations have had identical boards of directors since 1993. The directors comprise most of the common shareholders and own approximately 70ï¿½percent of G.B. Financial and approximately 93 percent of Border Bancshares. Voting for this action: Chairman Greenspan, Vice Chair Rivlin, and Governors Kelley, Phillips, and Meyer.

The Federal Reserve Board today published a revised list of over-the-counter (OTC) market stocks that are subject to its margin regulations (OTC List). Also published today is a revised list of foreign equity securities that meet the margin criteria in Regulation T (Foreign List). The Lists are effective May 12, 1997, and supersede the previous Lists that were effective February 10, 1997. The next revision of these Lists is scheduled to be effective August, 1997. These Lists are published for the information of lenders and the general public. The changes that have been made to the revised OTC List, which now contains 4,849 OTC stocks, are as follows: 160 stocks have been included for the first time, 136 under National Market System (NMS) designation; 41 stocks previously on the List have been removed for substantially failing to meet the requirements for continued listing; 84 stocks have been removed for reasons such as listing on a national securities exchange or involvement in an acquisition. The OTC List is composed of OTC stocks that have been determined by the Board to be subject to margin requirements in Regulations G, T, and U. It includes OTC stocks qualifying under Board criteria and also includes all OTC stocks designated as NMS securities. Additional NMS securities may be added in the interim between quarterly Board publications; these securities are immediately marginable upon designation as NMS securities. The Foreign List is composed of foreign equity securities that are eligible for margin treatment at broker-dealers. Effective July 1, 1996, foreign stocks that have a "ready market" for purposes of the Securities Exchange Commission's (SEC) net capital rule may be included on the Foreign List. The SEC effectively treats all stocks included on the Financial Times/Standard & Poor's Actuaries World Indices (FT/S&P-AW Indices) as having a "ready market" for capital purposes. The Board is adding 23 foreign stocks and deleting 32, based on changes to the FT/S&P-AW Indices. The revised Foreign List now contains 1,965 securities displayed in country order. Margin regulations generally limit the amount of credit a person or firm may obtain to buy or carry stock. Stocks on the OTC List and the Foreign List are subject to the same margin requirements (currently 50 percent) as stocks listed on national securities exchanges in the United States. This means a person or firm buying a stock on credit must make a down payment equal to at least 50 percent of the purchase price of the stock and may obtain credit for the remaining 50 percent. These margin requirements are only applicable to credit extended on OTC or foreign stocks after they are placed on the Lists and the Lists have become effective or the stocks are designated as NMS securities. No credit may be extended by broker-dealers on stocks that are not traded on a national securities exchange unless they are on the OTC List, the Foreign List, or in the NMS group. Credit extended by banks and other lenders on foreign stocks or OTC stocks that are neither on the OTC List nor in the NMS group need only conform to the good faith lending limitation contained in Regulations G and U. It is unlawful for any person to cause any representation to be made that inclusion of a stock on the OTC List or the Foreign List indicates that the Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission has in any way passed upon the merits of any such stock or transaction therein. Any references to the Board in connection with these Lists or any stocks thereon in any advertisement or similar communications is unlawful.
