Remarks by Governor Edward M. Gramlich Economic and financial education At the Georgia Summit on Economic and Financial Education, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia September 4, 2003 Thank you for inviting me to speak at today's conference. For many years, the Federal Reserve has played an active role in furthering economic education among youth. Recently, we expanded our involvement by promoting the importance of personal financial education for all demographic and social groups. In May, we launched a national campaign that included a public service announcement featuring Chairman Greenspan. Our goal is to increase public awareness of the value of effective personal financial management in home ownership, higher education, retirement security, and overall economic well-being. While some may not consider the topic of economic and financial education to lie within the purview of a central bank, it is in fact quite consistent with the Federal Reserve's interests in many areas--economic policy, banking supervision, consumer regulation, public information, and community affairs. Hence, we appreciate your efforts in furthering education on these topics and applaud your interest in strengthening the effectiveness of your programs. As you are well aware, a solid understanding of economics and finance is relevant to both individual financial success and to the proper functioning of markets. Consumers who are familiar with basic economic principles, who are able to analyze personal financial scenarios and options, and who have access to pertinent financial information are important components to the success of our free market system. With these tools--knowledge, analytical skills, and access to information--consumers are able to make more effective financial decisions. This furthers market efficiency by creating demand for products that are more responsive to consumer needs. As providers of economic and financial education, you are quite familiar with the difficulties of choosing among the myriad products and services offered by our financial services sector. Financial markets are becoming steadily more sophisticated and expansive. Consumers are required to assume ever greater responsibility for managing their personal finances, such as their employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts. The result is that the need for financial education is also growing, and is indeed experiencing an unprecedented level of attention and funding from a broad base of supporters, ranging from financial institutions to employers to faith-based organizations. With the growth in financial education programs has come an increased interest in measuring the effectiveness of such programs. Performance and outcome measurement should be the way to justify continued support for any program. Further, the data collected for the program evaluation process can identify "best practices" which can be replicated on a broad scale to increase the reach and effectiveness of successful programs. But unlike readily quantifiable outcome measures such as business profits, a bright-line test of success is not always available for financial education programs. There is often no single outcome that conveys success, and the determinants of achievement may depend on factors that vary from one individual to the next. Further, these programs may not realize a return on their investment for months, or even years. Given the importance of evaluating a program's success, leaders of various economic and financial education programs have been exploring ways to measure the effectiveness of their activities. Staff of the Federal Reserve and the Department of Defense are currently collaborating to develop extensive and ongoing survey instruments to measure the value of financial education courses offered to Army personnel. Organizations such as Jump$tart, the National Endowment for Financial Education, and the National Council on Economic Education have employed various testing and survey strategies to quantify the impact of and measure the need for their programs. In considering how to develop measurement criteria for financial education programs, it is logical to begin with primary objectives. The desired outcomes for financial education are Getting the message out--that is, increasing consumers' awareness of the importance of the issue to their well-being. Altering consumer behavior to improve short- and long-term prospects. These goals have parallels to other public awareness and educational campaigns, and the parallels can assist in program design and evaluation. I will illustrate by offering some perspectives. With regard to the first outcome--getting the message out--the Ad Council has sponsored studies to determine the impact of public service announcements on its targeted audiences. The findings suggest that certain public service announcements are effective in increasing awareness, reinforcing positive beliefs, intensifying concern, and moving people to action. One study, conducted by the Advertising Research Foundation, focused on the impact of public service announcements for colon cancer awareness that were aired in four major cities over the course of a year. The research found that as a direct result of the public service announcement, awareness of the threat of colon cancer increased by more than 3.5 times after a year, and the number of people discussing colon cancer with their doctor increased by 43 percent. The research also found that the message had a particularly strong impact on men, with awareness among males increasing nearly six times and the number of males taking action increasing by 114 percent. A separate study was conducted by the University of Wisconsin to gauge the impact of the National Crime Prevention Council's anti-crime campaign. This study found that awareness of the trademark McGruff the Crime Dog reached 80 percent among the general public and 88 percent among crime prevention practitioners. In addition, nearly one-third of respondents indicated that they had learned from the public service announcements, and one-fifth reported that they had taken specific actions as a result of what they had learned from the campaign. These research findings suggest that issue-related information campaigns not only increase awareness of the importance of a given topic, but also motivate positive behavior change. The second objective is to alter consumer behavior. This key goal is unfortunately quite difficult to quantify, but financial education organizations have committed their resources to conduct surveys and administer tests in order to better estimate programmatic impacts. The U.S. Department of Education is one agency that has conducted such assessments. It studied literacy programs involving teaching-related issues, including the provision of reading skills instruction to parents alongside children, the effectiveness of participatory and traditional approaches to teaching, and strategies for increasing participation and ongoing development of reading skills. While there are many factors that differentiate financial education from adult literacy training, certain research results are suggestive. In particular, studies of methods that engage both parents and children in the educational process do reveal positive outcomes. One study compared the results of participants in Toyota Families for Learning, a family literacy-training program, with the results for participants in two adult-oriented literacy programs. Participants in the family-focused programs gained more than one grade level in their reading skills after one year, much greater than the grade-level increase of students in the two adult-oriented programs. The study attributes the increased level of success to higher retention rates in the family-focused program. It showed that 19 percent more adults remained in the family-focused program for more than twenty weeks. Other research on family literacy programs indicates that benefits also spread to child participants, with young children showing an increased interest in literacy and being better prepared for school than their peers. Some other relevant information on educational programs designed to change consumer behavior may be found in research sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service. The agency has evaluated a range of nutrition education, health promotion, and social marketing programs intended to improve consumers' understanding of the importance of good nutrition. The agency reviewed more than 200 studies that evaluated education research and intervention programs. These studies found that successful programs typically had five common characteristics: They set behavior change as a specific program goal. They incorporated motivating communications into the program. They taught strategies for behavior change. They included active involvement of both the individual and the community. They attempted to build health-enhancing environments. The review also highlighted the findings of one evaluation of a school health education program reaching about 30,000 students. This study found that between five and fifteen hours of instruction resulted in enormous gains in students' knowledge about nutritional programs. However, between twenty-five and fifty hours of instruction were required to bring about any change in student behavior and attitudes, and even with this amount of instruction, the effects on attitudes were very small. These findings demonstrate the enormousness of the challenge in influencing behavior change through education. I would also like to comment on the importance of developing effective information-delivery mechanisms. The agencies previously mentioned, along with others, have developed innovative Internet-based programs to provide education and information. Technology can play a big role here, by increasing the efficiency of financial education programs and by centralizing resources into information clearinghouses, which may help to reduce duplicative efforts and better exploit scarce resources. One example involves the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), which engages in activities that promote informed consumer decision-making. The agency uses different strategies to provide information to consumers on various health-related issues, including medical conditions and procedures, as well as on the range of choices in health care options and plans. Over the last several years, AHRQ has been developing software and database programs designed to help consumers and others choose among the wide variety of health care plans. This system, the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans, uses computer-driven survey instruments and reporting tools to collect data that permit a better understanding of consumers' sentiments about health care programs and experiences. Such a system could serve as a model for using technology to help consumers assess their financial needs. Let me conclude by repeating how pleased I am to see this group of dedicated professionals meeting and discussing the challenges that face public educators. I would like to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta for hosting today's conference and bringing together this group of educators. With your expanded knowledge and new contacts, I encourage you to continue to seek new and innovative ways to further your work and measure the outcomes of your programs. Success in increasing economic and financial literacy will be very important to the individuals you serve, as well as to the overall economy.
For immediate release An online guide for U.S. and foreign banking organizations submitting applications to the Federal Reserve has been added to the Board of Governors' public web site. The new web page, , describes the regulatory requirements and processing procedures for applications, notifications and requests necessary for a broad range of activities, including mergers of banking organizations. The site describes specific types of applications as well as the statutory factors considered by the Federal Reserve in evaluating applications, including the banking organization's record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. It provides links to application forms and lists contacts at each Reserve Bank for questions regarding the submission of applications or the submission of public comments on applications.
Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Department of the Treasury For Immediate Release September 9, 2003 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY AND FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM ANNOUNCE DATE OF ISSUE FOR SERIES-2004 $20 NOTE Safer, Smarter, More Secure $20 Note to Begin Circulating October 9 Businesses Prepare Employees and Vending Machines for "The New Color of Money" The first newly redesigned Series-2004 $20 notes, featuring background colors and improved security features, will be issued October 9, the U.S. government announced today. On the day of issue, the Federal Reserve System will begin distributing the new notes to the public through the nation's commercial banks. "This is the most secure note the U.S. government has ever produced," said Federal Reserve Board Governor Mark W. Olson. "Its enhanced security will help ensure that our currency continues to represent value, trust and confidence to people all over the world. It will co-circulate with older-design notes, and the public can rest assured that all U.S. notes will continue to be legal tender." The U.S. government launched a worldwide public education program last May when the new $20 design was unveiled, to create awareness among the general public and to help banks and businesses prepare for the new $20 note. A wealth of training and informational materials, highlighted by an interactive demonstration of the bill's security features, is available to download or order through . Since the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) began taking orders last May, more than 7,500 businesses and organizations have ordered training materials. Today's announcement of the October 9 day of issue will signal to banks and businesses that they should make final preparations for the new notes. "Our aim is the seamless introduction of the newly redesigned bills," said BEP Director Tom Ferguson. "To that end, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has been working with the vending machine industry for over a year to ensure that they have the information they need to make their equipment compatible with the newly redesigned bill by the time it enters circulation on October 9. Additionally, we have been working with businesses and industry associations across the country to provide them with the materials they need to educate their employees on the new $20 note and its updated security features." Counterfeiting: Increasingly Digital To stay ahead of counterfeiters, the U.S. government plans on introducing new currency designs every 7-10 years. The new design for the $20 note will be followed by new designs for the $50 and $100 notes over the next few years. Redesign of the $5 and $10 notes is under consideration, but there are no plans to redesign the $1 and $2 notes. Counterfeiters are increasingly turning to digital methods, as advances in technology make digital counterfeiting of currency easier and cheaper. In 1995, for example, less than 1 percent of counterfeit notes detected in the U.S. was digitally produced. By 2002, that number had grown to nearly 40 percent, according to the U.S. Secret Service. Yet despite the efforts of counterfeiters, U.S. currency counterfeiting has been kept at low levels, with current estimates putting the level of counterfeit notes in circulation worldwide at about 1-2 notes in every 10,000 genuine notes. Security Features The new $20 design retains three important security features that were first introduced in the late 1990s and are easy for consumers and merchants alike to check: The watermark --the faint image similar to the large portrait, which is part of the paper itself and is visible from both sides when held up to the light. The security thread --also visible from both sides when held up to the light, this vertical strip of plastic is embedded in the paper. ï¿½USA TWENTYï¿½ and a small flag are visible along the thread. The color-shifting ink --the numeral ï¿½20ï¿½ in the lower-right corner on the face of the note changes from copper to green when the note is tilted. The color shift is more dramatic and easier to see on the new-design notes. Because these features are difficult for counterfeiters to reproduce well, they often do not try. Counterfeiters are hoping that cash-handlers and the public will not check their money closely. The New Color of Money The most noticeable difference in the notes is the subtle green, peach and blue colors featured in the background. Different colors will be used for different denominations, which will help everyone--particularly those who are visually impaired--to tell denominations apart. While consumers should not use color to check the authenticity of their currency (relying instead on the user-friendly security features noted above), color does add complexity to the note, making counterfeiting more difficult. The new bills are the same size and use the same, although enhanced, portrait of Andrew Jackson on the face of the note and historical vignette of the White House on the back. The redesign also features symbols of freedom--a blue eagle in the background to the left of the portrait, and a metallic green eagle and shield to the right of the portrait in the case of the $20 note. The first newly redesigned Series-2004 $20 notes, featuring background colors and improved security features, will be issued October 9, the U.S. government announced today. On the day of issue, the Federal Reserve System will begin distributing the new notes to the public through the nation's commercial banks.

For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the issuance of a Cease and Desist Order against Craig Van Stone, a former senior vice president, chief financial officer, and cashier of the Premier Bank, Denver, Colorado, addressing Mr. Van Stone's compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act. A copy of the Cease and Desist Order is attached.
Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For Immediate Release September 12, 2003 Agencies Issue Rulemakings to Amend Risk-Based Capital Treatment of Exposures to Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Programs and Securitizations with Early Amortization Provisions The federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies today requested public comment on an interim final rule and a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) to amend their risk-based capital standards for the treatment of assets in asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) programs consolidated under the recently issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). The NPR would also modify the risk-based capital treatment of certain securitizations with early amortization provisions. An ABCP program is usually carried out through a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity generally sponsored and administered by a banking organization (banks, bank holding companies, and thrifts) to provide funding to its corporate customers by purchasing asset pools from, or extending loans to, those customers. The ABCP provides funding for these assets through the issuance of commercial paper into the market. These issuances may be credit enhanced by various means, usually by a sponsoring bank. Under the interim rule, sponsoring banking organizations may remove consolidated ABCP program assets from their risk-weighted asset base for purposes of calculating their risk-based capital ratios. However, sponsoring banking organizations must continue to include any other exposures they have to these programs, such as credit enhancements, in risk-weighted assets. The interim rule also amends the risk-based capital standards to exclude from tier 1 and total capital any minority interests in ABCP programs consolidated by sponsoring banking organizations under FIN 46. The interim rule will be in effect only for the regulatory reporting periods ending September 30 and December 31, 2003, and March 31, 2004. The risk-based capital treatment set forth in the interim rule does not alter the accounting rules for balance sheet consolidation as set forth under generally accepted accounting principles. Consequently, banking organizations will be required to report consolidated ABCP program assets in their tier 1 leverage ratio calculation. The NPR solicits comments on a permanent, risk sensitive risk-based capital treatment for the risks arising from ABCP programs. In particular, it proposes to permanently permit banking organizations to exclude from their risk-weighted asset base those assets in ABCP programs consolidated onto sponsoring banking organizations' balance sheets as a result of FIN 46. In addition, the NPR also would require banking organizations to hold risk-based capital against liquidity facilities provided to ABCP programs with an original maturity of one year or less. This treatment recognizes that such facilities, which currently are not assessed a capital requirement, expose banking organizations to credit risk. The agencies are also proposing a risk-based capital charge for certain types of securitizations of revolving retail credit facilities (for example, credit card receivables) that incorporate early amortization provisions. The goal of these capital proposals is to more closely align the risk-based capital requirements with the associated risk of the exposures. The interim final rule and NPR are being issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision. Comments on the interim final rule and NPR are due 45 days after their publication in the Federal Register.

Remarks by Governor Mark W. Olson At the America's Community Bankers 2003 National Compliance and Attorney's Conference and Marketplace, San Antonio, Texas September 22, 2003 Increased Availability of Financial Products and the Need for Improved Financial Literacy
Remarks by Governor Donald L. Kohn At the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Monetary Seminar, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania September 24, 2003 Productivity and Monetary Policy President Santomero promised you my "perspectives on monetary policy." That is an open-ended topic, and I thought it might be useful to focus on one factor that has been critical in making policy since the mid-1990s--the behavior of productivity. It was about that time that the underlying growth of labor productivity turned up. And productivity has risen even more rapidly over the past few years, when the economy has been through recession and modest recovery. Indeed, in the second quarter of this year nonfarm business productivity increased at an astounding 6-3/4 percent rate. My focus will not be on the reasons for the changed behavior of productivity--though they will inevitably be an important part of the story. Instead, I thought I would concentrate on one aspect of the acceleration of productivity: its consequences for aggregate demand. That relationship is of obvious interest to monetary policymakers, who are constantly assessing the balance of aggregate demand and potential supply as we pursue our legislated goals of maximum employment and stable prices. I think that the relationship should also be of interest to teachers of economics as a real-world illustration of some of the complications that we face in the policy process. Movements in potential GDP affect how interest rates and aggregate demand relate in product-market equilibrium--and not in entirely straightforward ways. The topic seems particularly timely now in light of the behavior of productivity over the most recent business cycle. We can all agree that faster productivity growth benefits U.S. residents over the long-run; it is the foundation for rising standards of living. But its cyclical effects may differ--or be perceived to differ--over time. In the late 1990s, the pickup in productivity fueled a powerful surge in output that resulted in a drop in the unemployment rate. Eventually, a rise in interest rates was required to align aggregate demand with potential output to avoid a pickup in inflation. More recently, rapid productivity growth has been associated with the "jobless recovery" and a period of unusually low interest rates to stimulate aggregate demand. I have some thoughts on these issues but no definitive answers. And, I stress, they are my thoughts and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or its staff. We will really know the answers only ex post , after the final chapter is written on the current business cycle and after numerous data revisions provide us with a better fix on the behavior of productivity. As policymakers, of course, we don't have the luxury of waiting for the outcomes and revisions. We are weighing probabilities in the here-and-now, given incomplete information. That is what makes policy so much of a challenge--and so much fun--at least for an economist. Productivity and Monetary Policy: The Theory In standard models, at a given real interest rate, a sustained increase in the growth rate of productivity should boost demand even more than it does potential supply in the long run. Or, to put the same thing another way--market interest rates eventually must rise after an upturn in productivity growth to equate demand and supply. The extra pressure on demand comes from several sources once the long-run growth of supply notches higher and is recognized by economic agents. To keep the growth of the capital stock in line with the now-elevated growth of output, investment needs to rise substantially. The principal incentive for this rise comes through the marginal product of capital, which will increase if the capital stock does not keep up with output. Consumption also should rise relative to income because workers revise up their expectations of permanent income and, unless interest rates do rise promptly, because wealth tends to move higher with the increase in the expected rate of growth of profits and dividends. In the short run, whether demand exceeds or falls short of potential supply and whether interest rates need to rise are ambiguous. The answer will depend on such factors as how quickly households revise up their expectations of permanent income and whether the increase in productivity itself requires higher investment for it to be realized--for example, whether it flows from new technology necessarily embodied in new capital equipment. Indeed, if the recognition of these developments by households lags considerably and if growth in the capital stock need not pick up right away, interest rates might even have to fall for a time to boost demand to the higher level of potential. This short-run ambiguity presents a challenge to monetary policy. Because of the lags in the response of the economy, policymakers must not only analyze the existing situation but also form a judgment about how demand and supply are likely to evolve over the next several years. The Late 1990s It took some time to recognize the upturn in productivity growth in the late 1990s and to understand the effects it was having on the economy. What we observed was very strong growth in output accompanied by a decline in the unemployment rate, but that decline was smaller than would have been anticipated based on previous estimates of the rate of increase in the economy's potential. We also saw that the response of prices to the drop in the unemployment rate was considerably more damped than might have been expected given historical relationships; in fact, some measures of inflation decreased in circumstances in which previous statistical regularities suggested that they ought to have been moving higher. Of course many things were going on at the time, but one hypothetical change that seemed to solve a number of these puzzles was a rise in the trend rate of productivity growth. It explained the slow pace of the drop in the unemployment rate. Moreover, it made the behavior of inflation more understandable because the productivity gains seemed to take a while to feed through to higher growth of labor compensation in labor markets and thus lowered business costs initially. As indicated by the drop in the unemployment rate, the response of demand was rapid and strong and exceeded the pickup in supply. Steep decreases in the prices of high-tech equipment contributed to a boom in investment as companies acquired new capital equipment to make use of new technology. Consumption was boosted by a rising stock market when investors built in higher growth of expected corporate earnings as well as by upward revisions to permanent incomes. The strength in activity was all the more remarkable when one considers that a sharp rise in tax payments associated with capital gains on equity and increases in income damped the rise in disposable income. Moreover, a portion of the pickup in demand was deflected to other countries by a surge in imports when foreign investment attracted to the United States by new profit opportunities strengthened the dollar. With increases in demand outrunning gains in potential output, it seemed evident that interest rates were going to have to rise at some point. The timing of that increase was influenced by several considerations. Financial and economic crises in East Asia beginning in 1997 followed by the financial market turmoil after the Russian debt default in 1998 damped global demand. In the latter event, the Federal Reserve actually eased policy to counter the potential threat to stability in financial markets and the economy. In addition, as I pointed out earlier, the inflationary effects of excess demand were held in check by the productivity gain itself, which lowered business costs and raised profits, with the subsequent price competition reducing inflation. In that environment, the unemployment rate fell a little below 4 percent without material effect on the rate of inflation. This high level of labor utilization probably could not have persisted indefinitely--at some point compensation might well have begun to accelerate beyond even that justified by the faster growth of labor productivity. But, in the interim, the absence of increasing inflation pressures meant that the Federal Reserve did not need to tighten to bring demand back in line with the potential as soon as it otherwise might have needed to. All this is clearer in retrospect. At the time, we could only observe outcomes that did not fit with preconceptions; try to find rationales that explained what we were seeing; and in the process, derive implications about the future that could be used to guide a forward-looking monetary policy. It also is now evident that demand became even stronger than was justified by the increase in potential. Something real definitely happened--productivity growth turned up--but, not surprisingly, private agents had a hard time evaluating this change and calibrating its implications for profits, incomes, and wealth. As a consequence, capital was overbuilt, especially in some sectors, and equity markets became overvalued. These miscalculations became evident only later, and the resulting corrections have roiled both product and financial markets in the past few years. Nonetheless, overshooting and correction do not invalidate the basic story I outlined above--that underlying productivity growth did increase and over time such an increase in trend productivity boosted demand at least as much as supply--a pattern consistent with economic theory. Recent Years In the past few years we have witnessed a very different macroeconomic configuration. Productivity growth has remained quite strong, but demand has been inadequate to keep the economy expanding fast enough to create jobs. The question is whether these circumstances are related--whether, as is often implied, the rapid productivity growth causes the weak employment. In an arithmetic sense the relationship looks plausible--for a given path of demand, the more rapid the productivity growth, the weaker the labor market. But the arithmetic explanation does not comport with economic theory relating demand and supply over the longer run or with the experience of the late 1990s. The facts are clear. The actual increase in productivity has been remarkable in the past few years. For productivity to accelerate early in a recovery is not unusual. But that surge typically follows a period of very weak productivity growth or even outright decline during recession when businesses lag in cutting back on labor. Most often, the pickup in productivity is also associated with a very rapid increase in demand and activity, which businesses may not have anticipated in their hiring and which they meet in part by correcting some inefficiencies that built up earlier when the economy had unexpectedly weakened. The current cycle saw neither a decline in productivity during the downturn nor a rapid rebound in output once recovery began. Instead, we have observed persistent strong productivity gains through the recession and even stronger increases in the modest recovery since then. Nonfarm business productivity rose 3-1/4 percent in the recession year of 2001, 4-1/2 percent in 2002 and at a 4-1/2 percent rate so far this year. From 1996 through 2000, it rose at a rate of 2-1/2 percent. It is also evident that despite rapid productivity growth, demand has been tepid. Moreover, the weakness has been led by business investment, which in our story ought to respond strongly to rising productivity. Demand has been sufficiently weak that jobs have continued to decline, opening up economic slack and putting further downward pressure on an already low inflation rate. Surely one important explanation for the weakness in demand is that the economy has been paying the price for previous over-exuberance. Anticipating greater profits and sales than they ultimately realized, businesses acquired more capital equipment than they could usefully employ, at least for a time. This was especially the case in telecommunications but likely pertained to equipment in some other sectors as well. As a consequence, beginning in late 2000, investment fell sharply as firms worked to align increases in capital stocks with now-lower longer-term expectations for growth in sales and earnings. Similarly, as equity prices fell, households needed to raise saving rates to achieve life-cycle objectives for wealth accumulation. The associated restraint on spending was compounded by multiplier-accelerator effects that followed the initial cutbacks. In sum, just as an increase in expected productivity growth tends to cause spending to rise, a downward adjustment in expected productivity growth, even if from unrealistic levels, will tend to bring with it a reduction in demand. It was not only capital spending and equity prices that seemed to overshoot in the late 1990s; credit was provided with undue optimism about prospects for repayment. With the realization that borrowers were riskier than had been earlier thought, yield spreads widened dramatically. Then, in mid-2002, both debt and equity markets reacted strongly to revelations that in some cases lenders and investors had been relying on incomplete and misleading corporate reporting. In an environment of very skittish financial markets, where the cost of capital to many private firms was increasing and access to funding could be impaired quickly and unexpectedly, businesses decided they had to conserve cash by further slashing capital spending and hiring. These corrections explain part of the weakness in demand, but they do not help us understand why productivity has been so rapid or why the productivity growth has not elicited a stronger response in demand. A clue is provided by the observation that the source of the productivity gains has shifted since the late 1990s. Productivity was boosted importantly by high investment earlier but not more recently. From a growth accounting perspective, capital deepening--the amount of capital for each worker--has become much less important as a contributor to productivity growth since 2000, with most of the increases attributed to rising multifactor productivity. Lags between the introduction of new technology and its full effects on productivity have been evident in history, and perhaps we are now seeing a version of these lags with respect to information technology. In the second half of the 1990s, the cost of high-tech equipment was falling so quickly and applications for it were spreading so rapidly that businesses found that they could raise productivity substantially by buying large amounts of this new equipment and other capital goods geared to working with it. In recent years, businesses have concentrated on reorganizing and rationalizing production processes to more fully realize the efficiencies inherent in the new equipment and the changing skills of the workforce. Obviously, productivity growth generated through this rationalization process will not have the direct demand-augmenting effect of productivity increases realized through more rapid investment spending. The shifts in the relationship between demand and productivity and in the source of productivity growth probably have been accentuated by the changing economic and financial environment. The rapid growth of output, the high profits, and the elevated share prices of the second half of the 1990s seemed to lead businesses to concentrate on expanding and on acquiring the latest technology rather than on wringing all they could out of the capital they were buying. The drop in profits, the heightened caution in financial markets, and the slower growth of demand in the past few years have reduced incentives to expand and have put considerable pressure on businesses to damp spending and cut costs. To the extent that the productivity increases of the past few years are resulting from businesses learning how to use existing technologies and capital more effectively and from more intense pressure to realize cost savings, productivity gains in the future may not be as large as those experienced recently. If private agents hold this view, expectations of future income and profits would be damped relative to the outsized productivity gains of late, curtailing the indirect effects of those gains on demand. In addition, the perceptions of households and firms about the growth of future income and profits may be heavily influenced by their recent experience, perhaps even more than by the longer-term trends in productivity and potential output that figure so prominently in our economic models. Just as households and businesses may have extrapolated earlier very rapid, but unsustainable, economic growth, it would not be surprising if the recent economic weakness may have led them to expect smaller increases in output and income than will turn out to be justified by underlying trends. Businesses in particular appear to have been quite restrained in their projections of future sales, likely further damping demand over the past few years. Moreover, the attacks of September 11, 2001, and subsequent geopolitical uncertainties, reflected in part in energy prices and in volatile financial markets, have given businesses added reasons to be guarded about the outlook and cautious in making the commitments for the future inherent in purchases of capital goods and expanding the workforce. The combination of high productivity growth and weak demand has presented some interesting issues for monetary policy. An ongoing challenge has been to analyze developments, as we have been doing this evening, and infer their implications. Because this cycle has been unusual, historical precedents or patterns have not provided much guidance about the future. Sorting out the possible reasons for the continuing weakness in investment, which has played a key role in this episode, and hence predicting its likely persistence has been especially difficult. Estimates of capital overhangs are problematic at best; and by their nature, the effects of one-time factors extraneous to the cycle--such as geopolitical risks--cannot be reliably quantified. In such circumstances, the policymaker has little choice but to pay particularly close attention to incoming data but also to remain mindful of the difficulty separating signal from noise in high-frequency information. As events have unfolded, surprisingly rapid productivity growth that did not feed through immediately to demand has had important implications for the stance of policy. With a very high pace of output growth needed just to keep margins of slack from rising but substantial restraints on demand, policy has had to be more accommodative for longer than it would otherwise have been. The real federal funds rate has been in the neighborhood of zero since late 2001--even longer than in the jobless recovery of the early 1990s. Nonetheless, growth has not yet strengthened sufficiently long enough to stabilize the job market, much less to begin to eat into the considerable margins of excess labor and capital capacity. I want to emphasize that the problem has not been productivity growth per se . The difficulty for policymakers has been anticipating how demand would evolve relative to the productivity-enhanced path of potential supply. Because productivity increases are not raising demand as much as might have been expected and may even have been delaying the recovery of investment by enabling businesses to increase output without expanding physical capacity, and because other forces also are holding back demand, the size of the task facing macroeconomic policies in promoting high employment has been all the greater. The reasons for pursuing an unusually easy policy to speed a return to higher levels of resource utilization have been bolstered by the effects of rapid productivity growth on inflation. Gains in efficiency have damped prices directly by holding down costs and indirectly to the extent they have made the tendency toward slack in labor markets greater. Inflation has been quite low--to the point of meeting Chairman Greenspan's definition of price stability as a situation in which expected price increases do not affect the decisions of households and businesses. In that circumstance, further declines in inflation will not increase economic efficiency; indeed, they could complicate the future conduct of policy if they resulted in inflation and nominal interest rates so low that the monetary authority had inadequate scope to counter downward shocks to demand with its usual policy instrument of the short-term interest rate. As the Committee's minutes relate, the desirability of forestalling significant additional declines in inflation has been a factor in the Federal Reserve's aggressive easing of policy in recent years and in its judgment that accommodative policy will be required for a "considerable period." Going Forward Long-term trends in productivity are extraordinarily difficult to forecast, as we learned in the 1970s and the 1990s. Nonetheless, I do not think I am too far out on a limb in predicting that the underlying growth in productivity over the next several years is likely to be less than the extraordinarily rapid gains of the past year or so but to remain considerably in excess of the weak growth of the 1970s and 1980s. As I noted, some of the very recent increases reflect efforts by firms to realize more fully the efficiencies inherent in the capital stock they had previously acquired. And some may be temporary responses to a high level of business caution. Still, the persistent outsized increases in productivity testify to the continuing potential for using new technologies to achieve greater efficiencies, and we have no reason to think that they have been fully exploited. We are on an "S"curve from one state of technology to another but very likely only part way up that curve. The rise in productivity is unambiguously beneficial over the long run. And over time, demand should strengthen at least enough to match potential supply. In particular, businesses will want to begin adding to capital stocks to keep pace with continuing growth in sales. Further declines in the relative prices of high-tech capital goods will reinforce the incentives to make these additions. The resumption of growth in capital implies a considerable rebound in investment. Such a strengthening will require that businesses feel comfortable with their current level of capital and more confident that demand for their products will grow in the future. In recent months, we have seen some encouraging signs of a pickup in business spending on capital equipment. Most of this demand is probably for replacement and modernization rather than expansion, but the stepping-up of such purchases after a long period in which replacement cycles had been stretched out does suggest that the sense of gloom is lifting, even if it has not been replaced yet by optimism about the growth of future sales. Businesses are being helped by stronger cash flows as profits revive and much more resilient financial positions after the balance sheet restructuring of recent years. They are also finding financial markets more receptive. As credit difficulties have begun to ease, much of the run-up in spreads since 2000 has been reversed. A substantial rise in equity prices since late last year has also evidenced greater confidence by investors and has helped to strengthen household balance sheets. But these are just early signs that the process of adjustment is ebbing and the extra degree of caution is receding. It will be a while before we can be sure that a self-sustaining expansion is underway of sufficient strength and persistence to put the economy back on a path toward full employment. Continued business caution is especially evident in spending on inventories and on hiring. Firms seemingly have not run out of ways to expand output without adding to their capital base or their labor force. As a consequence, labor markets remain quite weak, and slack, if anything, has increased despite what many economists are estimating to be quite vigorous growth in the third quarter. Our challenge as economists and policymakers remains to analyze these ongoing developments and to judge the likely course of productivity and economic potential and its interaction with demand. In my view, however, even if demand does continue to strengthen, the low level of inflation together with continued solid gains in labor productivity and the considerable margin of slack in resource utilization that has built up suggest that monetary policy can remain focused on fostering further robust expansion and limiting disinflation.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan At the 33rd Annual Legislative Conference of the Congressional Black Caucus, Washington, D.C. September 26, 2003 Financial Education I am pleased to be here today to discuss the importance of financial education for consumers. Forty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., challenged this nation to fulfill its promise of freedom and equality for all citizens, to ensure that all Americans are able to participate in day-by-day business without being hampered by debilitating discrimination. In those forty years we have witnessed a great deal of change. However, the momentous goal of ensuring that everyone has access to the benefits of our free and efficient market economy has yet to be achieved and remains as relevant today as it was in August of 1963, when marchers gathered around the Lincoln Memorial. Increasing economic prospects for people in traditionally underserved neighborhoods and granting every individual the opportunity to succeed remains crucial to our national well-being. A strong and effective system of education is one fundamental way to strengthen our economy and raise living standards. And education about personal finance that helps consumers of all ages meet the challenges and demands of our increasingly knowledge-based economy is one important component of such a system. Trends in Consumer Finances Today's financial world is highly complex when compared with that of a generation ago. Forty years ago, a simple understanding of how to maintain a checking and savings account at local banks and savings institutions may have been sufficient. Now, consumers must be able to differentiate between a wide range of financial products and services, and providers of those products and services. Previous, less-indebted generations may not have needed a comprehensive understanding of such aspects of credit as the impact of compounding interest and the implications of mismanaging credit accounts. Today, however, the advance of telecommunications technologies and the development of other new technological tools have broadened the availability of credit and other banking services. More generally, these advances mean consumers must be familiar with the role that computers play in the conduct of every traditional financial transaction, from withdrawing funds to borrowing. Data, both empirical and anecdotal, point to trends in consumer financial conditions that have caused concern among some consumer groups. Household debt has risen appreciably in recent years. While analyses suggest that, overall, the level of debt is being serviced adequately, a record number of nonbusiness bankruptcy filings reveals that many consumers are experiencing significant financial distress. Regulators, lenders, community leaders, and consumer advocates also continue to be concerned about abusive home mortgage lending practices and other consumer credit practices that target vulnerable populations. Financial education is especially critical in the effort against these deceptive practices. Consumers empowered with the information to make educated financial choices are less susceptible to fraud and less likely to become entangled in financially devastating credit arrangements. Trends in the Financial Services Industry Some may believe these trends indicate that market forces have hurt consumers. On the contrary, household and business borrowers have benefited from the technological developments that have enhanced financial services, and their remarkable growth. Computer and telecommunications technologies have lowered the cost and broadened the scope of such services. Consequently, specialized lenders and new financial products tailored to meet very specific market needs have proliferated. At the same time, the development of credit-scoring tools and the securitization of loan pools are opening doors to national credit markets for both consumers and businesses. Deregulation has encouraged competition and innovation by opening the marketplace to the entry of new service providers and the expansion of existing service providers. Throughout our banking history, markets have adjusted to respond to demand. These structural changes have heightened competition, resulting in lower costs and the emergence of increasingly diverse and highly specialized organizations. These entities range from banks and brokerage firms that offer their services exclusively through electronic delivery mechanisms to locally based public-private partnerships that provide counseling and financing arrangements to low- and moderate-income families. The Role of Financial Education Given the significant changes in the financial marketplace, some consumers may lack sufficient familiarity with the newer financial concepts to make sound decisions. In response, government agencies, major banking companies, grass-roots consumer and community groups, and other organizations have developed a wide variety of financial education programs. Some are tailored to specific products such as credit cards and home equity lines of credit, and others are focused on specific consumers, such as military personnel, college students, or first-time homebuyers. Yet other programs adopt a more comprehensive approach, teaching broad audiences about savings, credit, budgeting, and similar topics. All of these programs are designed to give individuals tools to manage their personal financial affairs and make responsible decisions about products that can improve their economic well-being. The financial services industry maintains a keen interest in financial education programs and provides significant support. A recent nationwide survey of bank-sponsored financial literacy programs at fourteen of the largest twenty-five banks, as well as other smaller banks, noted a consistent increase in the number of financial institutions that support financial education initiatives. Bankers who responded to a 2003 Consumer Bankers Association survey reported that 98 percent offer financial literacy programs or work with partners that support such efforts. Many bankers participate because they want to be recognized as good corporate citizens; however, many other bankers have realized that their activities may help them reach hard-to-serve markets such as immigrants or people without a relationship with a bank. Organizations, including some of the Federal Reserve Banks, working at the community level have established Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites, where instructors not only help people with their tax returns, but also teach them how to budget their income, pay their bills, and manage credit. These programs are especially noteworthy since preliminary research reveals a considerable number households that receive tax refunds intend to save them or invest them in education and other wealth-building activities. Building a Foundation for Financial Education Children and teenagers should begin learning basic financial skills as early as possible. Indeed, improving basic financial education in elementary and secondary schools can help prevent students from making poor decisions later, when they are young adults, that can take years to overcome. In particular, it has been my experience that competency in mathematics--both in numerical manipulation and in understanding the conceptual foundations--enhances a person's ability to handle the more ambiguous and qualitative relationships that dominate our day-to-day financial decisionmaking. For example, through an understanding of compounding interest, one can appreciate the cumulative benefit of routine saving. Similarly, learning how to conduct research in a library or on the Internet enhances decisionmaking. Focusing on improving fundamental mathematical and problem-solving skills can develop knowledgeable consumers who can take full advantage of the sophisticated financial services offered in an ever-changing marketplace. While some adults may believe that financial and related mathematical concepts are too complex for younger school children, I was pleased to have an experience that dispels such thinking. In June, I had the opportunity to discuss financial matters with a sixth-grade class that had begun a financial education program sponsored by Operation Hope, a national nonprofit organization. The children's surprisingly precocious questions demonstrated an ability and a desire to learn more about the fundamental principles of money and banking. This encounter and countless others in classrooms and community centers across the country indicate that, in the long run, better basic education at home and in elementary and secondary schools can provide the foundation for a lifetime of learning. But not all have risen to the level of that sixth-grade class. We need to exert especial effort to improve the skills and earning power of those who appear to be falling behind. The Federal Reserve has a keen interest in promoting financial education and increasing the visibility of resources for consumers. In May, the Federal Reserve launched a national campaign to highlight the importance of personal financial education and money management to achieving short- and long-term goals such as pursuing higher education, purchasing a home, or starting a business. This initiative includes a public service announcement, a printed brochure, and a dedicated that identifies resources for learning more about financial management products and services. The Federal Reserve also has a long-standing interest in increasing minority access to credit markets. We study access to mortgage and small business credit for underserved populations and have participated in a pilot program teaching mortgage finance at select community colleges. This innovative program, targeted to minority students in underserved communities, trains individuals for a broad array of career opportunities in mortgage lending. We also are interested in measuring the effectiveness of financial education programs. Studies evaluating such programs were presented at the . In addition, the Federal Reserve and the Department of Defense are collaborating on a study of the efficacy of personal financial management education provided to members of the military services and their families. This research will provide insights into what financial education interventions prove most effective with specific audiences and will provide valuable guidance for teachers, employers, and other financial education providers and funders. Building bridges between community organizations, educational institutions, and private businesses is essential to increasing familiarity with new technological and financial tools. And the success of such efforts will bear significantly on how well prepared our society is to meet the challenges of an increasingly knowledge-based economy. In closing, let us remember that education is the primary means for creating new economic and financial opportunity for everyone. If we are able to boost our investment in people, ideas, and processes, just as we do in machines and technology, consumers and the economy can readily adapt to change, providing ever-rising standards of living for all Americans.
