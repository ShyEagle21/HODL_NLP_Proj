Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. At the Owen Graduate School of Management, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee February 14, 2001 E-Commerce: Lessons Learned to Date I am pleased to be here with you today at Vanderbilt University. Your e-Lab and e-commerce programs make this a particularly appropriate place to talk about the lessons that can be drawn from developments in electronic commerce over the past several years. Governor Daane, thank you for inviting me to speak. The recent past has provided an excellent opportunity to observe how businesses and individuals respond to significant technological changes. But we should also be mindful that Internet-based commerce, in particular, is still young and unquestionably evolving. Hence, I must emphasize that these are only preliminary observations. Today I will touch on three main topics. First, I will explore a few early observations about the economics of electronic commerce based on the experiences of the past few years. Second, I will talk about payments, a key part of the country's economic infrastructure, and whether the current payment instruments can effectively support future electronic commerce. Finally, I will briefly review some activities that the Federal Reserve is pursuing to remove barriers to innovations in electronic payments and commerce. A Few Early Lessons of E-Commerce The terms "electronic commerce" and "e-commerce" generally refer to commercial activity involving the Internet, although they can also describe any commerce that relies primarily on electronic exchange of information. For many entrepreneurs, e--commerce is an entirely new market opportunity, while others see it as a versatile new channel offering opportunities to enhance existing markets. Whatever the business case for an application of new technology, generally successful applications have the potential to improve the lives of ultimate consumers by reducing transaction costs. Reduced transaction costs, in turn, can broaden the array of choices, expand the size of markets, and ultimately, through competition, improve the quality of existing goods and services. An initial observation is that, despite the novelty of the Internet applications we see today, electronics have been used for commercial purposes for well over a century. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, installation of telegraph wires and then telephone networks created a revolution in business communications not unlike the current e-commerce revolution, broadening markets by easing communications between distant trading partners and reducing risks associated with slow physical communication and transportation. In the extreme, telephone networks enabled two distant parties to communicate interactively and in real time. Of course, there are limits to the uses of voice communications. The advent of computers and new communications technology introduced the opportunity to transmit vast quantities of data, as well as voice, over existing telephone networks. The commercial prospects of combining new and existing communications technology with new information management technology, both software and hardware, spawned the investment boom that underpins, in part, the most recent revolution in e-commerce. But we must be careful to recognize that the rapid evolution of modern e-commerce does not repeal the laws of economics. In fact, we see now that economies with significant investments in information and communications technology remain subject to occasional capital goods overhangs, which may influence macroeconomic conditions. Over the last few months, data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods have provided hard evidence of a slowdown in business spending on high-tech capital goods. Our economy is clearly undergoing a stock adjustment to bring the supply of and demand for capital goods in some sectors into better alignment. Importantly, measures of growth of output per hour in the second half of 2000 were sufficiently strong to suggest that the growth rate of structural productivity remains robust. This in turn suggests that the rate of return on capital should be sufficiently attractive to foster new investment once this stock adjustment is complete. There are two key questions. First, when will the stock adjustment in high tech capital run its course, and the supply and demand for capital goods return to balance? Second, when balance is restored, what pace of investment in high tech capital goods will ensue? Unfortunately, neither question is answerable with certainty at this stage. With respect to the duration of the stock adjustment, those who think that the process will be protracted point to both the length of the current investment boom and the historical experience with lengthy stock adjustments in capital goods to suggest that the period of retrenchment will be a long one. Those who are optimistic that this phase of rebalancing will be relatively short highlight two facts. The adjustment in capital goods ordering and production has been relatively rapid in this cycle and modern high tech capital goods are relatively short-lived--being depreciated in many cases in three years or less as opposed to the seven years or more that characterizes many types of traditional capital equipment. Which of these sets of factors predominates will determine, in part, the shape of the recovery from this period of slowing. Similarly, we cannot know with certainty the pace of investment in capital goods going forward. As I will discuss below, it is certain that the pace of future demand for capital goods will depend in part on the ability of providers of capital--banks, creditors in fixed income markets, and purchasers of equity--to recognize the risks inherent in high tech capital investment plans and to price the risk appropriately. Let me now offer a few observations on cost, demand, and the microeconomics of e-commerce. The cost structure of electronic networks tends to be characterized by high fixed costs and very low marginal operating costs. This also appears to be true of the cost structure of a number of firms engaged in e-commerce. Initially, purchasing or developing software to support a competitive commercial enterprise on the Internet can be costly. But once software that meets a market demand is built, it can be paired with scalable hardware to handle significant additional volume for very little extra cost. It appears, however, that the basic cost structure of e-commerce has different applicability for different types of businesses in this sector. For example, the high fixed cost, low marginal cost model may fairly accurately characterize the cost structure of companies that provide on-line information services, such as information vendors, search engines, and electronic communications networks. Those that produce their own information content clearly pay some production costs, but those costs appear to be small compared with the cost of building and operating a network. Interestingly, many information providers do not originate any content at all and rely instead on markets, commercial partners, or even subscribers to provide the content. For different reasons, information-based e-commerce companies seek high sales volumes. They all wish to take advantage of the economies of scale that are inherent in their cost structure, seeking large scale to reduce their average production costs as volumes grow. As with other businesses that have this cost profile, e-commerce businesses in this category often respond to their cost structure by charging a flat fee per user, such as a subscription fee, with the price structure often transitioning to some form of discounted fee for heavy volume accounts. Obviously for those information-based e-commerce businesses for which advertising is the major source of revenue, scale is important to keep advertisers happy. Overall, even with rapidly declining marginal costs, if pricing does not cover the marginal costs and revenues in the long run do not recoup fixed costs, this model of e-commerce can prove financially disappointing. On the other hand, the cost structure for those e-commerce firms that use electronic means to distribute tangible goods, such as books, apparel, and toys, appears to mirror more conventional business models. The network costs for these firms reflect the well-understood high fixed cost and low marginal cost model of the electronic world. However, the economics of fulfillment--that is, providing and servicing the goods--still depend on these businesses' ability to achieve efficiencies and low unit costs for materials, storage, distribution, and after-sales service. The story of the demise of one prominent Internet-only retailer may be instructive in this regard. News reports indicate that the company had to build and maintain a web site costing about $40 million annually, the high fixed cost element of e-commerce, which it thought was required to achieve the desired revenue in the national market it hoped to serve. Besides this new economy cost, this retailer decided to build a proprietary distribution network, an old economy cost that, according to public sources, raised its investment in property and equipment to more than $100 million, a fourfold increase in one year. Analysts indicate that this equaled around 100 percent of the firm's 1999 revenues. As a benchmark, for land-based retailers a comparable number would be 20 percent of annual revenue and for catalogue retailers, who often subcontract distribution, the comparable number would be 12 percent to 13 percent. Finally, because of low barriers to entry to the Internet market and the low cost to customers of switching from one seller to another, Internet-only firms appear to face high costs to obtain and retain customers. Again, published reports indicate that the retailer increased its budget by 30 percent in one year as new competitors moved into its market. Clearly, appropriately scaling the cost model to the market potential is another key lesson in the world of e-commerce. On the demand side, the so-called network effect is extremely important for some e-commerce businesses because the value of some services increases as the number of customers using them increases. The most obvious example is an on-line auction site, in which the more buyers and sellers using an auction site, the deeper the liquidity--that is, the greater the number of opportunities to trade and the greater the likelihood that trades will occur. For these firms, which include those that support the "auction" of equities as well as collectibles, high volume is critical to their success, and volume expectations appear to influence investments in these firms. I have already referred to economies of scale. Auctions and chat rooms provide an example of how network effects and scale economies can be mutually reinforcing, making high transaction volumes critical to both the supply and the demand sides of the market. Here let me also note that, for those for whom advertising is a key source of revenue, there is a virtuous cycle as a large customer base attracts more advertisers, which in turn finances more and better content and attracts even more users. The need for scale or volume appears to create an advantage for the first business to achieve critical mass in any market in which there are strong network effects. Understanding this dynamic and taking advantage of it appears to be another lesson from the early experience with e-commerce. The evolution of investment in e-commerce firms, particularly web-only firms, continues to receive attention in the press. Needless to say, rational economic behavior suggests that investors would require a high return to invest in unproven but potentially profitable endeavors. After all, some innovations struggle but succeed, while others arrive too soon for the technology, arrive too soon for the market, or are not commercially successful for a wide variety of other reasons. The rapid reassessment of the business prospects of some e-commerce firms during the course of last year is a reflection of this reality. Of course, the equity securities of these firms were revalued to reflect these changing assessments. Are stocks today overvalued, correctly valued, or undervalued? I certainly do not know, and I am not aware of anyone who does. As a result, I believe that it would be unwise--and indeed impossible--for the Federal Reserve to target specific levels of valuations in equity markets. However, valuation methods that are appropriately sensitive to the obvious business risks of e-commerce, as opposed to being driven by the assumption of the most optimistic outcomes for every concept, are key. In the long run such approaches should provide a healthy base for maintaining a reasonable and sustainable pattern of growth and investment in the e-commerce segment. Costs of capital that reflect risks accurately are critical to a well-functioning economy. Therefore, with respect to observations and lessons, it appears that the basic rules of economics, commerce, and finance continue to apply. Though some macroeconomic conditions have changed importantly because of the technology investments that underpin e-commerce, the laws of economics have not been repealed. At the commercial level, any company considering a substantial investment needs to understand the business case and underlying market cost, competition, and demand structures. Companies and their investors still need to assess the potential risks and returns based on that commercial reality. Payments and E-Commerce Now I would like to turn to the topic of payment systems and discuss whether the existing arrangements support electronic commerce. In many ways the rapid growth of some elements of e-commerce is built on the solid base of preexisting payment systems and protocols. Even with the apparent ups and downs of specific electronic commerce providers, many purchases are being initiated through the Internet. The Census Bureau estimates that roughly $20 billion worth of retail transactions flowed over the Internet during the year ending September 2000, excluding large-dollar business-to-business transactions at least partly initiated through the Internet. Some private calculations reach twice that amount. These purchases are being paid for predominantly with traditional payment instruments that predate the World Wide Web. Given the growing importance and apparent potential of e-commerce, it is important that the older protocols of the payment system evolve to support this new element of our economy. To explore recent payment developments, it may help to distinguish among the markets for different types of payment transactions. Although the consumer-to-business (C2B), person-to-person, and business-to-business (B2B) categories likely break down when pushed too far, they can provide a convenient organizing framework for identifying payment transactions with some common characteristics. For some types of commerce, existing electronic payment instruments were easily adapted to the Internet. Most notably, small- to medium-sized C2B purchases are frequently made using credit cards. Because credit cards were already widely used for retail telephone transactions, these "card-not-present" transactions were easily accepted as part of commerce on the World Wide Web. Moreover, unlike many other payment instruments, credit cards could already support low-value international commerce, one of the historical barriers being challenged by the Internet. One card network estimates that 95 percent of retail purchases over the Internet in 1999 were made using debit, credit, and other payment cards. Some entrepreneurs are adapting other payment instruments for C2B electronic commerce. For example, debit card networks are exploring ways to enhance security and inter-network arrangements so that PIN-based debit transactions will be widely accepted as an alternative to credit cards for Internet-based sales. Similarly, vendors have developed pre-paid cards for which value can be purchased in advance and used to pay for on-line purchases by individuals who do not have access to credit cards or who prefer not to use them. In addition, some service providers have begun to offer "electronic check" or "e-check" products in which customers enter the information shown on the bottom line of a check and authorize the electronic debit of their checking accounts through a mechanism called the automated clearinghouse, or ACH. But existing and evolving payment instruments do not yet satisfy all of the needs of C2B e-commerce transactions. For instance, many firms provide bill payment services, and many are exploring ways to present bills electronically as well. Despite the growth of electronic bill payment applications, many of the bills for which payment instructions are initiated on-line are still paid by check. Similarly, there is not yet an easy way to pay for transactions such as on-line stock purchases, which have become popular. Instead, these purchases are generally charged against pre-funded brokerage accounts, although they could also be paid for by wire transfers through the purchaser's bank or by the prompt mailing of checks. Devising new ways to pay for securities trades is becoming increasingly important as the securities industry tries to reduce the time needed to settle trades from trade-date plus-three days to trade-date plus one day. For person-to-person commerce over the Internet, typically conducted through auction and similar web sites, there are very few electronic payment alternatives that can be easily transferred from physical commerce. Over the past few years, however, several service providers have created Internet-based person-to-person transfer mechanisms based on the credit card clearing mechanism but requiring transfer of funds through an intermediary. Other service providers enable individuals to accept credit card payments, a function previously available only to businesses. Finally, a number of service providers are also trying to address the market for electronic B2B transactions. Thus far, some companies have adopted corporate purchasing cards, issued by traditional card-issuing companies, for their low- and medium-value on-line purchases. The demand for improved payment instruments for B2B transactions, however, may be even greater than for the C2B and person-to-person markets. Improving speed, reducing risk, and ensuring appropriate levels of privacy are important in all three markets. Also, to attract users, B2B payment mechanisms may need to provide additional features--for example, tools that reduce credit and timing risks in domestic and international markets. Other desirable features might enable data to flow seamlessly through the internal systems of the purchaser, the seller, and perhaps intermediaries--all at a low cost, of course. Because the products or services, scale, and complexity of business-to-business transactions vary widely, satisfying the needs of this diverse market may be more difficult than satisfying those of the other markets. I have heard reports, however, that many banks and other organizations are aggressively seeking ways to provide services for this market. The Federal Reserve in the Payment System Now, turning to the role of the Federal Reserve, recall that one reason that the Congress established the Federal Reserve was to improve the nation's payment system; the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 provides the foundation for the Federal Reserve to establish a national check-clearing system. Today, the Reserve Banks distribute cash, clear checks, and provide electronic payment services to banks. In addition, the Federal Reserve System has had a long-standing role in helping to formulate public policies that improve the overall efficiency of the nation's payment system and reduce risks. Recently, evolving technology and growth in alternatives to cash and check payments have raised questions about the Federal Reserve's role in the payment system. In 1996 and 1997, a committee headed by Alice Rivlin, then the Federal Reserve Vice Chair, studied the Federal Reserve's operational role in the payment system. Ultimately, the study concluded that the Federal Reserve should continue to provide all its existing payment services with the explicit goal of enhancing efficiency, effectiveness, and convenience, while ensuring access for all banks. The study also recommended that the Federal Reserve work actively, closely, and collaboratively with providers and users of the payment system, both to enhance the efficiency of check and ACH services and to help develop strategies for moving to the next generation of payment instruments. To follow up on the recommendations of that study, the Federal Reserve created the Payments System Development Committee, which I co-chair with Cathy Minehan, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The Payments System Development Committee has an explicit mission. In addition to identifying strategies for enhancing the long-term efficiency of the retail payment systems, it also identifies barriers to innovation and works to address those barriers where possible. The committee is active in monitoring developments in payment markets and has sponsored workshops and forums that encourage focused discussions with the private sector. Our current activities include efforts to reduce legal and regulatory barriers to payment innovation, examine future clearing and settlement systems to support electronic commerce, assess our role in helping to set standards, and find ways to use new technologies to collect checks more efficiently. Conclusion The technological developments that enable us to engage in electronic commerce today have created tremendous opportunities to improve the ways in which we do business. Even as some businesses fail, they are contributing to our store of knowledge about what will and will not work in e-commerce. But beyond just the success or failure of specific businesses, electronic commerce has challenged the thinking of entrepreneurs and of those who lead traditional businesses. The developments in e-commerce have reminded us that change, even rapid change, is part of the normal evolution that we expect from market economies. They have also shown, however, that no matter what delivery mechanism is used, successful businesses must still follow good business practices, pay attention to basic economic principles, and sell products and services that buyers want. I believe this to be true for business generally and certainly for payments. A market-oriented approach to payment system innovation promises to provide long-lasting benefits to the consumers and businesses that use the U.S. payment system. We need to approach payment system innovations with an open mind and a willingness to learn. This is particularly true in the world of electronic commerce, where payments are being adapted to new technologies, products, and methods of doing business. These innovations are important in themselves. But they are also important because successful innovations to support electronic commerce may, over the long term, have a broad influence on the payment systems we use throughout our economy. I commend Vanderbilt University and its Owen Graduate School of Management for moving so forcefully to train the next generation of leaders in the e-commerce world. Not only are you serving your students; you are serving the global economy. Thank you for your attention.
Remarks by Governor Laurence H. Meyer Before the American Law Institute and American Bar Association, Washington, D.C. February 15, 2001 Implementing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: One Year Later Last year I spoke at this conference about the challenges of implementing the large and hugely complex Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB), the legislation that modernized our financial system for the twenty-first century. In the intervening twelve months, much has been accomplished. In keeping with the complexity of both the legislation and the issues, much remains to do. Today I would like to discuss both what we have done and what we will be doing, but, as I did last year, I will also try to give you some flavor of the issues we faced in making our decisions and how and why we came out as we did. Some of you may recall that I emphasized last year that GLB had two broad kinds of provisions. The first set was specific and explicit. In provisions, for example, such as the standards for becoming a financial holding company (FHC), the list of activities automatically permissible for FHCs, and cross-marketing restrictions with companies owned under merchant banking authority, the Congress told the banking agencies exactly what to do and how to do it, with little or no room for interpretation. Other provisions, such as the reasonable holding period for merchant banking investments and the specifics of permissible routine management for firms owned under that authority, were broad-brush, with little or no guidance for implementation. Most of the provisions were in the first category, perhaps reflecting the long time that the Congress has been debating the issues; when it finally acted, the lawmakers knew exactly what they wanted. The potatoes, as it were, had cooled and were reasonably easy to handle. In the second category of provisions, either the issues were particularly technical, or consensus was not reached; and hence the warmer--if not the hot--potatoes were handed to the agencies with the understanding that the decisions reached there were unlikely to result in unanimous acclaim. If that kind of decision were possible, the Congress would have reached it. I will begin by briefly reminding you of the thrust of GLB. GLB did not start with an entirely fresh sheet of paper but rather built on the pre-existing bank holding company structure. As such, the new activities authorized--all of which are financial--were to be contained in holding company affiliates or, with several exceptions, in financial subsidiaries of banks under certain broad constraints. The new activities were limited to companies that meet certain capital, management, and other tests. The holding company structure was favored explicitly as the vehicle to create the maximum separation between the bank and the new activities--both to protect the bank from the risk of the new activities and to avoid the extension of the safety net subsidy to a wider range of activities. This structure also retained the existing regulatory framework--with primary oversight of individual legal entities by functional regulators (if any) and umbrella supervision of the holding company by the Federal Reserve. The holding company framework also facilitated the so-called two-way street, permitting not only banking organizations to enter, de novo or by acquisition, the securities and insurance business but also securities and insurance organizations to enter the banking business, all the while leaving unchanged the regulation of individual legal entities. Though merchant banking--unlimited direct investment in nonfinancial companies for some limited holding period--was explicitly authorized for the newly created FHCs, full commerce and banking--the combining of nonfinancial and financial enterprises as integrated businesses--was explicitly rejected. Potential new activities must be evaluated on their financial--no longer banking--nature, as well as on whether they are complementary to finance--rather than on their intimate relationship to banking. This structure, of course, has some obvious tensions that, themselves, reflect some difficult compromises. These tensions, as we shall see, mean that both the regulators and the regulated face no bright lines on the commerce and banking front. The tensions also mean continuing frustrations on both sides as technology, innovation, and plain probing and creativity test the frontier. The Congress indicated that it wanted the system to evolve and gave the Federal Reserve the ability and authority to set the limits and, as events dictate, to adjust them within a broad range. One final introductory note perhaps is in order, and that is that GLB has not, as yet, induced a dramatic break with the past. It is true that we have seen the formation of almost 500 FHCs, twenty or so by foreign banking organizations. But the surprise is that three-quarters of the domestic FHCs have assets of less than $500 million, and half of these have assets of less than $150 million. We do not yet have full data, but these smaller entities creating FHCs--as well as the regionals--appear to be most interested in using the insurance agency and merchant banking powers authorized by GLB and far less interested in securities and insurance underwriting. And, of course, insufficient time has passed for more than a very few to have exercised even these more limited powers in a large way. Perhaps the second surprise is the lack of news among the largest entities, which most observers thought would be the significant beneficiaries of GLB. Only a small number of large FHCs have purchased securities firms since enactment of GLB, with the two largest involving FHCs based on large foreign banking organizations. The benefit of GLB to large domestic FHCs appears to be not so much the creation or acquisition of new securities subsidiaries as it is the freedom to exempt their pre-existing section 20 affiliates from the 25 percent revenue test constructed by the Board to comply with the old Glass-Steagall Act. No FHC has acquired a large U.S. insurance company since the Citi-Travelers merger before GLB. To date, only one broker-dealer, Charles Schwab, has purchased a commercial bank and become an FHC; only two other broker-dealers, both relatively small, have applied to the Board to buy a small bank. One large insurance underwriter was approved to acquire a bank and become an FHC since Citi-Travelers, and that bank is a small bank. Another insurance firm has filed an application to buy a bank, again small, and become an FHC. In short, except for the two foreign FHC acquisitions of large U.S. securities firms, there have been no cross-industry mega-mergers under GLB. It is, of course, possible that such mergers and even broader acquisitions of banks by insurance and securities firms have been slow to occur because of fear of the heavy hand of the Federal Reserve, despite pledges to be gentle by, and statutory restraints placed, on the Fed. I do not think that fear of the hand of the Fed--heavy or otherwise--has been significant, but I will not reject it outright. In addition, at least on the insurance side, there have been some necessary lags while insurance companies convert from mutual to stock form to facilitate their acquisitions of and by other firms. But it seems to me that fears of an aggressive Federal Reserve or changes in corporate form do not explain the slowness of banks to reach out across industry lines. These entities are used to Fed umbrella supervision and seem comfortable with it, and though their stock prices have declined, the purchasing power of their equities in an acquisition is still considerable. I continue to believe that the modest pace of financial restructuring can be explained by institutionsï¿½ taking the time to choose the businesses, markets, and structures that best fit their individual strategies. And, perhaps most important, many of the ï¿½newï¿½ activities had already been possible to banking organizations through various means, from section 20 to section 4(c)8, to the Small Business Investment Company, to the town of 5,000 insurance loophole, and so forth. The financial and banking revolution has always been more of an evolution. The genius of GLB is that it created a structure that will permit and channel that evolution for many years to come without the cost of seeking ways around the rules. But when GLB was passed, no backlog of new business concepts just lay in wait for the legal shackles to be broken; markets and deregulation had already moved financial organizations pretty much to where they wanted to be. What Has Been Done GLB requires several instances of joint rulemaking and study. Let me start with a couple of examples that I can cover without much discussion. One is the Treasury-Federal Reserve non-capital regulations on merchant banking, which covered everything from the scope of merchant banking activities to holding periods to permissible involvement in management. Proposed last March, these rules were adopted in final form at the end of last year. The blending of the expertise and focus of the two agencies, in both the policy and the regulatory senses, created, I believe, an excellent final product--again one that fully meets the congressional intent but that could not have been written by a legislative body. The GLB called for two studies. The first directed the Fed to evaluate the performance and profitability of loans made in conformance with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Board staff surveyed the largest 500 retail banking institutions and published the results last July. The study found that CRA-related lending was generally profitable but, for many institutions, less profitable than their other lending activities. Delinquency and default rates were typically similar to, or somewhat higher than, those of other loans. The second study--conducted jointly with the Treasury--considered the feasibility and desirability of a mandatory subordinated debt policy for systemically important depository institutions and their holding companies. The report on this study was submitted to the Congress in late 2000, almost five months ahead of the congressional deadline. The study found that subordinated debt issuance by large depository institutions may encourage market discipline and generate other supervisory benefits, and it indicated that the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision will consider ways to enhance their use of voluntarily issued subordinated debt in supervisory monitoring. Although the Federal Reserve and the Treasury chose not to recommend that the Congress make subordinated debt issuance mandatory at this time, the report indicated that research and evaluation of such a policy would continue. Now let me turn to several other implementation actions in somewhat more detail. Merchant Banking Capital GLB required the Federal Reserve and the Treasury jointly to write the rules on merchant banking but the responsibility for capital charges for this activity fell to the Fed. This experience turned out to be an educational one for us, in the best sense of the word. The merchant banking capital rule is a case study in the benefits of the public comment system. Regulatory agencies have their ideas and concepts vetted and challenged by the process, and I believe that as a result we developed a better and more workable capital rule--a rule we proposed last month. I am not naï¿½ve enough to believe that self-serving public comments are always better or more insightful than those of staff members or policymakers. But in this case, public comments led us to fundamentally review our approach, and I think the resulting proposed marginal capital charge better addresses the treatment of risks added by the increasing equity holdings at banking organizations. The new proposal is superior in another way. Very early in our review we recognized that the safety and soundness risks of equity holdings were the same regardless of the legal entity or the authority used. Though we began by considering the merchant banking authority, this risk concern quickly led us to consider all the other equity holdings--in Small Banking Investment Companies, under section 4(c)6, under section 24, and under Regulation K--as well. These considerations, and the views of our sister agencies, induced us to invite them to join us in developing joint interagency rules. I must say that the process was productive and creative, and I was struck by the high degree of cooperation and professionalism throughout. The resulting joint proposal by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is, in my judgment, an improvement on the original proposal. It carves out (or exempts) and therefore gives preferential treatment to equity investments in SBICs up to 15 percent of Tier 1 capital. Otherwise--with the exception of some holdings under section 24--it applies the same charge to all equity investments in nonfinancial companies held under these various authorities regardless of where held. Finally, the capital charge increases with the concentration of equity investments to tier 1 capital, beginning for non-SBIC investments with an 8 percent charge up to 15 percent of tier 1 capital and reaching a 25 percent charge for all equity investments in nonfinancial firms above 25 percent of tier 1 capital. In its own way, the joint proposal is another model for the kind of interagency cooperation required by GLB, a cooperation that leads to a better and stronger financial system. Privacy One of the more passionately debated issues in the law was the extent to which any financial institution, not just a bank, could share information about its customers with unrelated third parties . GLB requires that all financial institutions tell customers what information will be shared both with affiliated and with unrelated third parties . An institution may choose not to share information about its customers with either group, but GLB provides that, if the organization does share information with non-affiliates, consumers must be given the option to exempt themselves from such sharing. Now, most of this audience is composed of lawyers, and I assume, it comes as no surprise to you that translating these seemingly straightforward congressional instructions into regulations--to be jointly written by the Treasury, Fed, OCC, FDIC, OTS, National Credit Union Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission--was, at best, an interesting exercise and, at worst, a nightmare. The resulting initial effort was just that: our best start. Obviously, despite the fact--or maybe because of the fact--that we had an auditorium full of folks working on this, we could not predict every privacy issue or answer every question that might be raised by the myriad of privacy policies employed by the private sector. So, we'll revisit it over time and refine the rule as we gain experience. One of the major benefits of having developed this rule on an interagency basis is the simplified compliance burden for organizations that have entities subject to the privacy rules of different agencies. For example, a financial holding company that owns a national bank, a thrift, a securities broker, and a finance company would have entities subject to the privacy rules of the Fed, the OCC, the OTS, the SEC, and the FTC respectively. Because the agency rules are virtually identical in all key respects, those affiliated companies may use the same opt-out and disclosure forms if they all have the same privacy policies. An interesting side note on the privacy provisions of GLB is that they cover an expanding universe. The GLB applies the privacy rules to any "financial institution." That may sound like a banking term, but the GLB actually defines a "financial institution" to be any institution engaged in activities that have been determined to be financial in nature under the Bank Holding Company Act. There is no requirement that the company be a bank or be affiliated with a bank. As a result, every time the Fed and the Treasury determine that an activity is financial in nature and therefore a permissible activity for a financial holding company, a side-effect is that the privacy rules cover a new industry. For example, all securities brokers and dealers--even those that are not affiliated with a bank or thrift--are covered by the privacy rules because securities brokerage and dealing has been determined by the GLB to be financial in nature. This is an example of the Congress using one part of the GLB to do double duty to ensure that customers of like companies receive the same privacy protections, regardless of whether or not the company is affiliated with a bank. CRA and ï¿½Sunshineï¿½ One of the more difficult assignments the GLB handed to the banking agencies--one of the hot potatoes I referred to earlier--was development of the regulatory language to implement the so-called ï¿½sunshineï¿½ provisions of the CRA: the provisions require public disclosure of financial transactions between banking organizations and people and groups who discuss, with the organization or the agencies, CRA performance of the organizationï¿½s insured depository institutions. The difficulty is that the legislation is quite specific in places and, as I noted last year to this group, ambiguous if not conflicting in others. This difficulty, in turn, reflected hard bargaining and compromises among legislators. There might well have been no new law if the partiesï¿½ intent had to be unambiguously clear or, worse, if lawmakers had written the implementing regulations themselves. As might be expected when the OCC, FDIC, Fed, and OTS took pencil to paper, there were occasional disagreements about what the Congress intended. Again, the public comments were useful. Commenters from the banking industry as well as commenters representing consumer groups were surprisingly in agreement on a number of issues. We also received useful comment from several members of the Congress. Most commenters thought the agencies had gotten the disclosure and reporting provisions just about right--that is, they provided the amount of sunshine that was needed. There was also a fair amount of agreement that the agencies needed to better define exactly what the sun would shine on! Of course, this is where the statute was most opaque. In the end, the rule clarifies what types of CRA contacts are covered, who is covered, and when covered CRA contacts occur. These changes focus the sunshine more than the original proposal. Somehow, however, I don't think it's gotten us out of the heat. The reaction to our final rule so far has been rather subdued, and it's likely that some time will be needed to see how well the new rule works. New Activities and Banking and Commerce One of the places where the specificity in the legislation creates uncertainty is the intersection of constraints on banking and commerce, on the one hand, and the expansion of new activities on the other. The Congress specifically rejected commerce and banking in GLB but empowered the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to add to the permissible activities list any activity that is either ï¿½financial,ï¿½ without much guidance as to what that means, or is ï¿½complementaryï¿½ to financial activities, with no guidance. A ï¿½complementaryï¿½ activity, by the way, is not a financial activity, but it must both be related to financial activities and impose no substantial safety-and-soundness risk to depository institutions or the financial system. Now, this approach is both brilliant and frustrating. It creatively and pragmatically permits the Federal Reserve, as I noted in my introductory remarks, to respond to evolving market trends and technology without requiring the drawn out and always lagging process of amending statutes in response to market developments. But, at the same time, the legislation lists as explicitly permissible virtually all the activities that today are widely considered to be financial, while empowering the agencies to define as ï¿½financial,ï¿½ ï¿½incidental to financial,ï¿½ or ï¿½complementary to a financial activityï¿½ any new activity, with the constraint not to mix ï¿½banking and commerce.ï¿½ Put another way, perhaps in plainer English, GLB grants the agencies authority to move toward mixing banking and commerce at the margin as markets and technology begin to dim the already less than bright line between them. And it gives virtually no guidance on how to do so. This is, as a result, no easy task. Nevertheless, we have already begun carefully and deliberately to exert that authority, in keeping with clear congressional intent. Authorizing FHCs to act as a ï¿½finderï¿½ between buyers and sellers of goods and services was an easy first step, since national banks were already empowered to do so. But in response to requests, we have asked for public comment on proposals to authorize as ï¿½financialï¿½ or ï¿½complementaryï¿½ activities such as real estate agency, real estate management, expanded data processing, and development of new technologies for the delivery of financial products. In requesting that the Fed authorize these activities, FHCs offered their own rationales for why these activities are ï¿½financial in nature,ï¿½ ï¿½incidental to a financial activity,ï¿½ or ï¿½complementary to a financial activity.ï¿½ Some FHCs boldly argued that, on the one hand, anything done by a financial holding company or anything that includes processing a payment is intrinsically financial. Those approaches lead to no distinction at all between banking and commerce. On the other hand, simply allowing activities already allowed for banks is too limiting and undoes the change in standards that the GLB tried to make. These first proposals will allow the Fed to explore various rationales for finding activities to be ï¿½financial,ï¿½ ï¿½incidental to a financial activityï¿½ or ï¿½complementary to a financial activity.ï¿½ How we'll come out is unclear at this point; we are still collecting public comments. But what is interesting is that, because the GLB Act allows for a range of approaches, the exact definition of each standard may, as a practical matter, be less important to banking organizations. The ï¿½financial,ï¿½ ï¿½incidental to financial,ï¿½ and ï¿½complementary to a financial activityï¿½ authorities provide a range of standards that stretch from clearly banking to clearly commercial. Though we at the Fed must struggle to place each new activity in one of these categories, FHCs will be concerned only that we fit the activity into some category. To be sure, different procedural costs are associated with the different categories, but they are relatively minor. In the end, the key is whether the activity is permissible. And in that, the GLB has created a much more elastic framework than the previous Bank Holding Company Act and should allow the activities of FHCs to grow with--and perhaps lead--developments in the financial markets. Qualification Standards for Foreign FHCs The Congress, you may recall, required that foreign FHCs had to meet standards ï¿½comparableï¿½ to domestic organizations. The quandary created by the desirability and necessity to maintain competitive equity within the United States required some trade-off in areas where foreign and U.S. standards differ. A key issue is that foreign banks typically have no minimum home market leverage ratio while U.S. banks do. If ï¿½comparableï¿½ were taken too literally, the Board found itself potentially denying FHC status to foreign banks with high ratings because of these differences in U.S. and foreign regulatory capital rules, and being accused of imposing U.S. rules on foreign regulatory authorities. To deal with these differences, the Board last March adopted an interim rule that established a two-tier process. First, if a foreign bank's capital ratios met the threshold levels on a risk-based and leverage basis, the foreign bank was presumed to meet the regulationï¿½s well-capitalized standard. If one or more of the foreign bankï¿½s capital ratios did not meet the screening level, the foreign bank could use a pre-clearance process to request a determination by the Board that the foreign bank had capital comparable to that of a well-capitalized U.S. bank. In the comment period on this interim rule, foreign banks objected to use of the leverage ratio even as a screening device. After review of the comments and based on the Boardï¿½s experience with the interim ruleï¿½s pre-clearance process, the Board decided to eliminate the leverage ratio from the screening test for foreign banks. In making comparability determinations, the Board will consider such factors as the market ratings of the long-term debt issued by the foreign bank, the foreign bankï¿½s leverage ratio, the composition of the foreign bankï¿½s capital, other measures of the financial strength of the foreign bank, and, of course, the views of the home country supervisor of the foreign bank. This approach achieves comparability among banking organizations without penalizing foreign banks for their natural response to their own home country supervisorï¿½s capital requirements or allowing foreign banks an advantage over U.S. banking organizations that must meet the U.S. leverage ratio. This Board decision represented, I submit, a template of how to reach the intent of the Congress--competitive equity--while adjusting to international institutional differences. Put differently, it is an example of the application of agency expertise to fulfill congressional direction. Large U.S. banks, I might add, were in full support of this decision, both on equity grounds and in hope that the template I spoke of would be applied by the Europeans and others to U.S. bank activities abroad in similar cases. Umbrella Supervision and Interagency Cooperation As I mentioned both in my introductory remarks and in my comments last year, the GLB confirmed the Federal Reserve as the umbrella supervisor of BHCs and FHCs. However, it explicitly limited the Fedï¿½s role as umbrella supervisor reflecting concerns of securities and insurance firms that might become FHCs, and their functional regulators. The former were concerned about the intrusiveness of a regulator with a different historical responsibility and focus than they were used to, and the latter about the undermining of their authority. Briefly, the act limited the authority of the Fed to examine, impose capital requirements on, or obtain reports from those subsidiaries of FHCs that are also regulated by the SEC or the state insurance agencies. The role of the consolidated supervisor continues to be as the monitor of holding company risks that could affect the health or viability of affiliated banks. The Federal Reserve has initiated several efforts to enhance interagency cooperation, consistent with both the letter and the spirit of the GLB. The act calls for the Fed and the other agencies to cooperate on supervision and in some cases requires joint rule- and decision-making. I have already noted the merchant banking regulations and capital rules, the CRA sunshine regulations, and the joint privacy regulations. Now I would like to discuss other efforts. The Fed has aggressively sought ways to facilitate the sharing of crucial information concerning bank examination and other matters with the SEC and the state insurance regulators. We share information through writing formal memoranda of understanding (MOU) with the functional regulators. The Fed has worked out the provisions of the insurance-related MOU with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which is acting on behalf of fifty-five state and territorial insurance commissioners and is now in the process of getting these agreements signed. The Fed is also working with the SEC to develop an MOU covering the sharing of information about broker-dealers in FHCs. In the meantime, while we await the completion of the MOUs with the insurance and securities regulators, agency staffs have worked out arrangements to ensure that critical information is shared on a case-by-case basis. Besides the formal MOU arrangements, the Fed works continuously to improve its working relationships with other supervisors and to ensure maximum efficiency. For example, in May 2000, the Fed and the OCC developed and implemented a pilot program outlining practical operating arrangements for situations in which both agencies are involved in supervising individual large complex banking organizations (LCBOs). Within this framework, staff members from both agencies met to share supervisory strategies and examination plans and to coordinate supervisory actions for 2001. The general agreement that the agency supervisory teams will rely on each otherï¿½s existing work whenever possible, reflects both the letter and spirit of GLB. Working cooperatively, the agencies will assess their coordination at several LCBOs to learn from their relationships and to improve them. The bilateral relationships between different supervisors are obviously critical, but as the umbrella supervisor for FHCs, the Federal Reserve is in a unique position to facilitate multilateral relationships among supervisors. To this end, the Federal Reserve has hosted, and will continue to host, periodic cross-sectoral meetings for multiple supervisors to discuss issues relevant to various financial industries. These meetings are useful for building cooperation and improving each agencyï¿½s understanding of the different supervisory authorities and objectives. As these efforts and programs, as well as the recent joint merchant banking capital rules indicate, we believe that GLB requires communication, cooperation, and coordination among the banking agencies, the SEC, and the state regulators. This matter is not only one of congressional intent. It is a necessity for effective supervision and regulation of the small number of increasingly large, complex banking organizations. If, for whatever reason, we do not cooperate, the financial system may be put at risk. What is Left to be Done The Fed has not yet acted on one significant area, but plans to do so this spring: sections 23A and B. Sections 23A and B of the Federal Reserve Act limit the amount of funding that may flow from an insured depository institution to its affiliates, require that such credits be collateralized and require that all such funding be extended at market prices. These provisions have become even more important vehicles for insulating insured entities from the risks of ever-widening activities permitted by their affiliates and for limiting the use of subsidized resources outside banking. Next month we will begin collecting quarterly data on covered credit flows from bank subsidiaries of all BHCs to their affiliates and their own subsidiaries. We have been working to develop--and hope to publish this spring--a 23A and B regulation that incorporates new GLB provisions as well as many of the past interpretations, including definitions and exceptions. This regulation will include provisions implementing the GLB measures that address extensions of credits between a bank and its affiliates coming both from derivative transactions and through intraday settlement and payments transactions. The deadline for this part of the rules is May 2001. The challenge here is to implement the provisions of the legislation in a way that protects insured depository institutions with minimal disruptions to markets. Conclusion The challenges of implementing GLB will not end when 23A and B regulations, and the rules now out for comment, are adopted in final form. The real challenge will be to continue the interagency cooperation necessary to supervise and regulate the increasingly large and complex banking organizations that GLB authorized and the market and technology are creating. These entities are no longer banks, or securities firms, or insurance companies. They are something different, and it will take all our skills and best intentions to reflect the public interest in supervising them. The natural inclination of the agencies to protect and expand their jurisdiction must be reined in if we are to retain the spirit of this important legislation. Two other issues, it seems to me, will continue to challenge us. First, how should we supervise FHCs that are not dominated by banks, those that have relatively modest banking operations? Should they get the same prudential review as entities with large banking interests, and if different, how can competitive equity be maintained? Second, as hinted in my remarks, the Congress delegated considerable responsibility for adjusting the line between banking and commerce. Where should it be sketched, if not drawn, and how should it evolve over time?
Remarks by Governor Edward M. Gramlich Before the International Bond Congress, London, U.K. February 20, 2001 Governor Gramlich presented identical remarks at the Commonfund Forum 2001, Orlando, Florida, March 11, 2001 The Productivity Growth Spurt in the United States For the past five years the big news for the American economy has been a noticeable productivity growth spurt. Coming out of World War II, U.S. productivity growth was at historically high levels and then, in the early 1970s, it dropped suddenly and mysteriously. Apart from cyclical movements, low productivity growth continued to the mid-1990s and was thought to be a more-or-less permanent fixture of the American economic landscape. But, just as suddenly, in 1995 productivity gains started to shoot back up to very robust heights. Of all the economic statistics that analysts pore over, productivity growth is surely the most important in the long run. Productivity alone determines the long-run path of income per capita, or living standards. All kinds of projections feed off this long-run growth path--budget surplus projections, tax revenue projections, and entitlement trust fund projections. Because productivity growth is an important component of earnings growth, stock market valuations depend on the outlook for productivity. In today's open economy, internationally mobile capital searches the world for high returns, making productivity growth a factor in international currency valuations. Because productivity growth is also an important component of unit labor costs, it plays a major role in controlling inflation, at least in the short and medium run. Were national leaders able to pick one economic statistic to be favorable, they would surely pick growth in productivity. In this paper, I review some evidence on this U.S. productivity growth spurt. First I discuss its likely causes. Then I consider how widespread these gains in productivity growth are around the world and speculate on reasons that productivity growth gains may be positive in some countries and not in others. Finally, I discuss the macroeconomic implications of productivity spurts, paying particular attention to their implications for monetary policy. Recent U.S. Productivity Increases The growth of labor productivity is defined as the rate of growth of output less the rate of growth of labor input. Because firms typically let their employment respond sluggishly to output changes, productivity growth rates have always been volatile, falling sharply when labor is hoarded and surging ahead as output recovers. These spikes are quite evident in , which presents a historical series for labor productivity growth in the U.S. nonfarm business sector from 1960 to the present. Smoothing through these spikes brings out the essential picture. For most of the postwar period up to the early 1970s, U.S. labor productivity rose at the rate of about 3 percent per year. Then growth rates suddenly dropped to the level of about 1.5 percent per year. Though this drop may seem small, in fact it is enormous. At the earlier 3 percent rate of increase, per capita income would double in twenty-three years. At the subsequent 1.5 percent rate of increase, per capita income would double in forty-six years. But in the mid-1990s, just when everybody was getting used to low productivity growth, the growth in labor productivity picked up again. The smooth trend in shows that it is now back to the pre-1970 rate of increase. But the very recent numbers, arguably not the result of a cyclical expansion because they have appeared almost a decade after output began rising, are in fact among the highest in the whole forty-year period. At its rate of increase in the year 2000, per capita income would double in fourteen years. There could, obviously, be many determinants of rates of productivity increase. Given its definition, productivity growth could change with any factor that differentially affects output or labor growth, including the educational quality or demographic composition of the labor force. Productivity growth could also be influenced by atmospheric variables such as the overall business climate, stable prices, global competition, or the presence or absence of costly environmental and safety regulations. These factors are surely important and perhaps fundamental, but one can also look at productivity growth in a more technical way, using production functions. Explanations based on production functions try to distinguish between two components of productivity change. One is what is known as capital-deepening productivity change, or the amount of labor productivity attributable to higher levels of capital per worker. The other is what is known as multifactor productivity change (MFP), that occurring independently of supplies of capital and labor. As every economics graduate student learns early, production functions can be differentiated to identify the two terms, with the capital-deepening term represented by the growth of capital per worker times capital's share of national income and MFP growth represented by the production function growth residual. Since it is a residual, MFP growth could also reflect a great many other influences, including measurement biases. The U.S. economy has been in the midst of a significant investment boom, and a production function decomposition naturally emphasizes the role of capital deepening. As a share of nominal GDP, capital investment has been very large in recent years, close to its historical peak. And its rise has occurred with a fairly sharp drop in the average price of capital goods, so that the real investment share is clearly at a record high. An increasing portion of this capital investment is in the form of computers and other high-tech investment, which, because of its high gross rate of return, has a particularly large impact on overall productivity. If high-tech capital investment is defined as computers, software, and communications equipment, the real share of GDP devoted to this form of investment is now more than fifty times what it was in 1975. Using a narrower definition of just computers and software, the real share of GDP devoted to high-tech capital investment is now more than four hundred times what it was in 1975. The consequence is, however defined, an enormous recent buildup of the capital stock. And a production function analysis would tend to attribute much of that recent gain in overall labor productivity to capital deepening. Though capital-deepening productivity change may seem desirable, it is important to understand what it means in the long run. As a nation's share of income devoted to capital increases, its capital per worker rises, and there is capital-deepening productivity change. But as long as the nation does not indefinitely squeeze the share of output devoted to consumption, and what nation can, eventually capital's income share will stabilize at some higher level. Capital per worker will, too, and the capital-deepening term will then no longer contribute to increases in the rate of productivity change. Under most circumstances the nation will still be better off because the level of income per capita will be growing along a higher path, but rates of productivity change will no longer be increasing. Paul Krugman (2000) attributes some of Asia's recent economic difficulties to the fact that their earlier rates of productivity change were predominantly due to capital deepening and could not be sustained. Turning to the numbers for the United States, a comprehensive recent study has been performed by Board economists Stephen Oliner and Daniel Sichel (2000). They have broken capital into its various components, including information technology (hardware, software, and communications), and have estimated the separate contributions of each component. They find that, of the roughly 1 percentage point increase in labor productivity growth in the second half of the 1990s, capital-deepening from the information technology components together have accounted for about 0.5 percentage point of this increase. Oliner and Sichel's results run up to 1999--the recent even-more-rapid recent U.S. productivity gains are not included in their data. As for electronic commerce, Oliner and Sichel do a back-of-the-envelope calculation on the importance of network effects arising from the Internet and find its present contributions to productivity growth to be small. Most advantages of electronic commerce were not being realized even as recently as 1999--they remain for the future. Robert Litan and Alice Rivlin (2001) report results of interview studies suggesting that these future gains will be at least noticeable, if not substantial. Oliner and Sichel analyze the MFP residual and find that its growth, too, is influenced by the productivity advances in the production of semiconductors and computers. They estimate that this component of MFP growth alone accounts for another 0.25 percentage point of the productivity increase. Technology and investment together could then account for as much as three-fourths of the recent productivity increase. This is just one attempt at decomposition. Others lead to different results. Dale Jorgenson and Kevin Stiroh (2000) use a slightly broader concept of output and find the growth contribution from high-tech investment to be slightly smaller, both before and after 1995. Robert Gordon (2000) focuses on trend productivity growth, which in his model is smaller than actual productivity growth because of the sluggish response of labor demand to output growth. After this adjustment, Gordon finds much less of a change in trend productivity growth outside the computer sector itself. William Nordhaus (2000) uses the income side of the national income accounts and develops a concept called "well-measured output"--only those sectors for which output is relatively well-measured. Productivity change for this output concept has increased even more than for traditional concepts. The Council of Economic Advisers (2001) finds a substantial pickup in productivity, both inside and outside the computer industry. A number of disputes are implicit among these various estimates. There is the difference between actual productivity growth (Oliner and Sichel), trend productivity growth (Gordon), and well-measured productivity growth (Nordhaus). Given the difficulty in assigning productivity increases by industry, there is a dispute on how widely productivity implicit in the information revolution has spread across the economy. Gordon's results are on the narrow side; the Council, Nordhaus, and Litan and Rivlin either find or suggest much broader effects. There is also a significant dispute about measurement. Erik Brynjolfsson and Lorin Hitt (2000), and to some degree Nordhaus, make the argument that the productivity benefits of the information revolution are not captured in output statistics, leading to a downward bias in measured productivity. Others make essentially the opposite point on the input side, arguing that many high-tech workers put in much longer hours than they used to, and are paid for, implying an upward bias in measured productivity. As time goes on, many of these debates should presumably resolve themselves. At some point, it should be clearer how large the productivity shocks were, how much was cyclical and how much secular, how much was concentrated in particular industries, how much could reasonably be attributed to the boom in high-tech capital spending, how important electronic commerce will be, and how sustainable the growth spurt will be. International Experience Because the electronic revolution is at least in some sense a worldwide phenomenon, one should be able to understand recent trends in U.S. productivity better by looking at the degree to which this productivity growth spurt has been shared around the world. To a degree that is perhaps surprising to Americans, it has not been. International data are taken from a study by Christopher Gust and Jaime Marquez (2000) of the Board. The authors analyze data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for thirteen developed countries from 1980 to 1999. These data are not as complete as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data used to analyze U.S. productivity change because they do not permit the detailed decomposition of the capital stock that Oliner and Sichel use for the United States. But Gust and Marquez do show that both sets of data give a similar-sized increase in productivity growth for the United States. As the basic numbers from Gust and Marquez in show, overall U.S. labor productivity growth jumped from 1.5 percent in the 1981-95 period to 2.6 percent in the post-1995 period in the BLS data and from 1.2 percent to 2.3 percent in the OECD data. The increase in overall labor productivity growth between the periods is the same in both sets of data, and the increase in MFP growth is nearly the same. Using the internationally comparable OECD data to compare rates of productivity change across countries, we see that in the 1981-95 period the United States had the lowest rate of overall productivity change of all thirteen countries. The U.S. rate of 1.2 percent was slightly below that of Canada, Australia, and Sweden and far behind the rate of overall labor productivity improvement in all other countries. But in the post-1995 period, the U.S. sleeping giant awakened. In this recent period, the U.S. overall rate of labor productivity rose to third among the countries, behind only Ireland and Australia. In terms of growth rate changes, the United States, Australia, and Sweden are the only countries in which overall labor productivity growth increased, and the United States and Australia are the only countries in which it increased very much. In several countries--France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Spain--overall labor productivity growth slowed quite sharply. The decomposition given in permits this comparison to be made by controlling for the level of investment and hence focusing directly on the more sustainable component of productivity change, MFP growth. The United States, Australia, Ireland, Sweden, and Canada are the only countries in which the change in MFP increased, and the United States and Australia are again the only countries in which this increase was significant. Again, in France, Italy, Japan, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Spain, the rate of increase of MFP fell noticeably. Since changes in the rate of labor productivity growth can be partly explained by capital deepening, the real question brought out by these comparisons is why MFP rates of change are actually falling in many European countries. Gust and Marquez rule out several explanations. By showing that productivity growth is gradually slowing in most European countries, over fairly long periods of time, they strongly suggest that there is not a cyclical explanation for the international differences. By showing that some countries using hedonic price indexes for high-tech capital have not had productivity increases, they suggest that different measurement conventions are not the answer. The relative unimportance of measurement conventions is attributable to the fact that most foreign countries are not large producers of information technology equipment, suggesting that adjustment for quality in prices of these goods is likely to have little effect on their GDP growth. Indeed, a separate study by Gavyn Davies, Ben Broadbent, and Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli (2000) finds that, for the Euro area, the use of the U.S. hedonic price indexes to recompute GDP has only a small quantitative effect on labor productivity growth. These authors find that for Ireland, which produces a large share of high-tech products, the use of the U.S. hedonic prices would, however, have had a significant effect. There are other indications that the information technology revolution could explain the relatively good U.S. productivity performance. A recent study by the Agamus Consulting (1999) firm places the United States first or second among these countries in both the climate for and the success of innovation. The United States scores well in the OECD's (2000) index of regulation. In the automobile industry, U.S. carmakers have relatively short time lags between innovation and the actual production of cars. More broadly, countries that are leading in the information revolution might also be expected to be those showing the most significant MFP increases. As Oliner and Sichel find, the direct production of high-tech equipment can raise overall MFP growth if producers of these goods themselves are experiencing large efficiency gains. Moreover, the use of information technology may also boost MFP growth on the demand side, as transactions costs are lowered or as businesses reorganize to take advantage of network effects arising from greater use of Internet-ready computers and electronic commerce. This explanation can be crudely tested by running some simple, one-variable, cross-section regressions with the OECD data from the thirteen developed countries. The dependent variable is the change in MFP rates of increase, post-1995 compared with pre-1995. One independent variable is the number of secure Internet servers per capita in the country. An alternative independent variable is the nation's nominal share of capital investment devoted to information technology. The logic is that the capital-deepening term of the production function would control for plain old capital investment. Changes in MFP could then be related either to the composition of capital, high-tech versus low-tech, or to some other variable measuring the technological revolution, such as Internet servers per capita or the high-tech investment share. A final independent variable, using similar logic, might be the nominal share of business GDP made up of information technology spending. The regressions appear in . Each regression fits reasonably well for a cross-section regression, and the regressions tell a consistent story. Other things being equal, the number of Internet servers or the share of spending devoted to information technology has a strong positive influence on the change in MFP. In each case the relevant independent variable clearly passes the test for statistical significance. With due deference to the problems of international data comparison, in general and specifically regarding the hedonic pricing of high-tech investment, this international evidence then reinforces the domestic economy results of Oliner and Sichel. Overall investment seems to be important in raising productivity through the capital-deepening term. And information technology spending seems to be especially important--partly because it, too, is investment and partly because of its apparent role in raising MFP. Implications of Increases in Productivity Growth In the long run, the implications of increases in productivity growth rates are fairly obvious. Per capita living standards will grow at a higher rate, and all variables that depend on income will be influenced accordingly. Long-run budgets will move toward a greater surplus, as projected revenues grow relative to expenditures. The actuarial balance of social security trust funds will be improved, as projected payroll tax revenue based on wage income grows relative to retirement benefit costs. Forecast retirement costs will grow, too, because social security benefits are often wage-indexed until the time of retirement, but not as much as forecast trust fund revenues. Determining the implications of increases in productivity growth for inflation in the short- and medium-run is more complicated. Productivity gains are typically thought to reduce inflationary pressures by expanding aggregate supply relative to aggregate demand. But such need not be the case, if the productivity gains sufficiently expand equity values and spending on consumption and investment. Equity values are likely to rise in anticipation of later income gains, so the wealth-income ratio will rise. If the impact of wealth on spending is large enough, productivity increases can actually expand aggregate demand more than supply in the short run, though presumably not in the longer run once the rise in income causes the wealth-income ratio to readjust. Increases in productivity growth can also influence inflationary pressures on the cost side. Typically, wages are believed to lag productivity changes, so rises in productivity are reflected in near-term declines in unit labor costs, reducing inflationary pressures from the cost side. But in a competitive labor market, workers should eventually get paid for what they produce, so wages should eventually catch up and eliminate the short-term effect on unit labor costs. The way they catch up could depend on the pattern of productivity increases. There could be different types of productivity growth spurts. Labor productivity could follow an S-shape pattern, with a positive second derivative of productivity followed by a negative second derivative. This pattern would occur in a typical neoclassical growth model following a movement toward greater capital deepening. Or, productivity growth could jump to a new level, with no change in the second derivative of productivity in all periods other than the exact kink point. Though such a pattern is not consistent with any known growth model, it does more closely approximate the actual historical pattern in the United States, where productivity growth suddenly dropped to a lower level for more than two decades. In an S-shaped pattern, wages may initially lag productivity and then gradually catch up as productivity hits its phase of negative second derivatives. In this event, productivity gains will at first create a decline in inflationary pressures and then a rise--exactly the reverse of the aggregate demand-aggregate supply balance discussed above. In the kink pattern, wage growth may initially lag behind productivity change, but this decline in inflationary pressures would be followed by a movement back toward a neutral effect. Productivity gains may also have even more complicated influences. Both foreign and domestic investors may be tempted to invest in the new high productivity equipment. As stated above, this new investment may boost aggregate demand, hence increasing inflationary pressures. After a short interval, it will also boost the capital stock, generating further capital- deepening productivity change and a drop in inflationary pressures. To the extent that the capital inflows come from abroad, productivity gains are also likely to generate currency appreciation, putting downward pressure on import prices and overall prices. But the effect on capital equipment spending and foreign capital inflows should be temporary, and exchange rates, import prices, and domestic prices should all return to their previous paths. Finally, in most growth models, changes in long-run productivity growth will also raise real interest rates, limiting investment demand but also simultaneously raising domestic currency values. This effect, too, will improve the actuarial forecasts for social security trust funds that have at least some initial assets. Central Bank Responses How should a central bank respond to all of these factors? The balance between aggregate demand and supply is likely to be changing, cost pressures are likely to be changing, investment and the capital stock are likely to be changing, international exchange rates are likely to be changing, and real interest rates are likely to be changing. Many of these movements are likely to end or be reversed at some point. Analytically, one would clearly need a multi-equation model to work everything out. Although policymakers will generally have neither sufficient time nor sufficiently precise multi-equation models to analyze all these influences fully, I do think there is a workable policy strategy. My general answer to the policy quandary involves adapting a form of inflation targeting, a monetary policy strategy that has been successful and growing in popularity around the world. In forward-looking, flexible inflation targeting (FFIT), a central bank would try to steer the economy toward some target rate of core inflation. If inflation threatens to rise above the target, for whatever reason, the central bank would tighten policy to limit spending pressures that may lead to inflation. Though not as well publicized, most actual inflation-targeting regimes are also two-sided. This means that if recession threatens, actual inflation is likely to come in below the target level, inducing a central bank following FFIT to ease policy, limiting the recession and actually nudging inflation back up toward the specified inflation target. In this sense, a FFIT monetary strategy may be pragmatically indistinguishable from a monetary strategy that follows a Taylor rule or some other kind of automatic feedback rule. The harder question is operational. In actual practice, how does a central bank following FFIT know when to tighten and when to ease policy? In the U.S. context, such a central bank might use several proximate guides: The level of resource utilization and the balance between the growth of aggregate demand and aggregate supply seem clearly relevant to future inflation. The central bank should try to forecast these magnitudes. The central bank would have some estimate of the level and growth of aggregate supply, including any gains in productivity, and would compare this estimate with a forecast of the level and growth in aggregate demand, with the latter possibly generated by an econometric model. If the rise in the wealth-income ratio, investment demands, exchange rates, or real interest rates influence spending demands, they would be factored in here. Direct inflationary cost pressures also matter, and these should also be factored in. Here is where unit labor costs, or specifically the relationship between productivity growth and wage increases, would come into play. Here is also where the influence of commodity prices, energy prices, and exchange rates enter, though some of these factors would be temporary shocks and not indicators of true inflationary pressures. Because all forecasting is uncertain, it makes sense to get readings from other forecasters. At least in the United States, there are now a series of other forecasts that can be examined, from the Blue Chip indexes to longstanding surveys of the ways in which economists and average people are forecasting inflation. A standard drawback of reported forecasts is that the forecasters are not forced to stand behind their projections. In such cases, buttressing recorded forecasts with information about actual market trades makes sense. The most direct of these data is the spread between nominal bonds of a standard maturity, say ten years, and real or inflation-indexed bonds. This spread is sometimes affected by liquidity considerations, but in normal times it can be a good measure of the ten-year inflation foreseen by bond traders, a group that should be fairly sensitive to inflation. A FFIT regime might have these four, or more, components in its targeting exercise, tightening policy when most of the components suggest that inflation is accelerating and easing policy if inflation appears to be quiescent and recession threatens. A FFIT regime used in this way seems particularly well-adapted to episodes in which productivity changes, moving a number of variables in the inflation process in different directions, with different cycles. I make no claim that such a process is easy or mistake-proof, but I do claim that this type of a framework at least permits each of the variables to be factored in appropriately. However such factoring is done, a central bank should also take seriously the other F, for "forward-looking." Given lags in monetary policy, the central bank must move before the actual need for stimulus or restraint. Moreover, the indicators of upward or downward pressure should be leading indicators. For that reason, all the measures on the list above are either explicit forecasts or outcomes based on other forecasts. Conclusion The United States productivity growth spurt, realized to a much lesser extent around the world, can be attributed largely to a combination of an investment boom and a technological revolution. The investment boom generates productivity gains through capital-deepening, and the technological revolution seems to raise MFP growth. The two forces may also be complementary, in that the technological revolution could raise investment profitability while the investment boom could speed a restructuring of industry. The changes in productivity unleash all kinds of long- and short-run forces. In the long- run the effects are surely positive, leading to greater growth in per capita living standards and a lessening of the long-run entitlement spending problem. In the short-run, aggregate supply will rise, aggregate demand could rise, unit labor costs should fall, at least temporarily, and there could be further influences on investment, the capital stock, exchange rates, and real interest rates. Sorting through all of these influences is a daunting task indeed. But there is a policy strategy that nicely adapts to this welter of conflicting influences. Forward-looking, flexible inflation targeting can forecast future pressures in either an inflationary or recessionary direction, and it is at least a feasible way for the central bank to respond to this multiple-variable complexity.

Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. At a conference sponsored by the Securities Industry Association and the University of North Carolina School of Law, New York, New York February 27, 2001 Understanding Financial Consolidation Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to speak to you today, and I thank the Securities Industry Association and the University of North Carolina School of Law for inviting me to participate in this conference. Consolidation of all types of business activities has been a prominent feature of the economic landscape for at least the past decade. The financial sector has participated actively in this development. Indeed, the last few years have witnessed an acceleration of consolidation among financial institutions. Thus, your choice of topics for this afternoon's session is a timely one. In recognition of the importance of this marketplace evolution, and especially its potential effects on a wide range of public policies, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Ten nations in September 1999 commissioned a major study of the possible effects of financial consolidation on matters of policy concern to central banks and finance ministries in the G-10. This study, which I was privileged to direct, was released to the public late last month. Today I would like to discuss the study's major findings and their implications. Before reviewing these findings, however, let me make a few comments about current economic conditions. As always, the views I will be expressing are my own and are not necessarily shared by other members of the Board of Governors or of the Federal Open Market Committee. Current Economic Conditions Recent data on the U.S. economy confirm that a significant deceleration in activity has occurred. Our economy is clearly undergoing a stock adjustment to bring the supply of and demand for inventory and capital goods in some sectors into better alignment. One key question is: When will the stock adjustment run its course? Unfortunately, this question is not answerable with certainty at this stage. The predominant risk remains that growth will be notably slower than would be consistent with the economy realizing its full potential over time. One factor pointing to a risk of unacceptably slow growth is the uncertainty about consumer sentiment, which has been a feature of the recent period. It is therefore useful to explore more deeply economists' understanding of consumer confidence. Usually, consumer sentiment closely mirrors contemporaneous economic conditions, and it generally moves closely with the growth in household spending. Not surprisingly, the key influences on household spending, such as the growth of personal incomes and the buoyancy of financial markets, also appear to bear importantly on consumer sentiment. Relative to other indicators for the household sector, the indexes of consumer sentiment are available on a very timely basis and so can provide an early reading on the direction of household spending. Moreover, while it is a contemporaneous indicator of household spending, sentiment also seems to have some limited predictive ability for future household spending. These advantages notwithstanding, we are, of course, continually attempting to evaluate those numbers in the context of the entire range of other indicators for the household sector. A somewhat puzzling feature of the recent period has been that, despite the sharp weakening in sentiment, household spending appears thus far to have held up well. How these apparently conflicting signals will be resolved going forward is not at all apparent from today's vantage point, and will bear close scrutiny. Another recent development has been some adverse movement in inflation rates. Recent inflation changes have been influenced importantly by increases in energy prices. Prices of petroleum-related products increased notably through the first half of last year, followed more recently by sharp increases in prices of natural gas and, in some regions, electricity. Largely reflecting these developments, consumer price inflation has accelerated appreciably over the past year to 3-3/4 percent over the twelve months ended in January. The Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy has accelerated as well over the past year, but much more modestly than the overall index, to a rate of increase slightly above 2-1/2 percent. Energy prices likely contributed to the price increases of non-energy items through their effect on transportation costs and other inputs to production. Looking forward, participants in futures markets expect crude oil prices to continue to move down. Spot natural gas prices are well off their January highs and are expected to move still lower. If these expectations prove accurate, this should help contain inflation through both these direct and indirect channels. Furthermore, any easing of resource utilization associated with relatively damped economic growth should also restrain price pressures going forward. In the current environment, monetary policy faces the short-term challenge of discerning the uncertain dimensions of the current slowdown in economic growth and responding appropriately. Any such response, however, will be made in the context of our continued commitment to an unchanged long-term mission--namely, the promotion of maximum sustainable employment through pursuit of price stability over time. The G-10 Study of Financial Consolidation Let me now turn my attention to the topic of this afternoon's program, namely consolidation in the financial sector. The G-10 study had two primary objectives. It attempted to isolate the effects of consolidation from those of other powerful forces transforming our financial systems and to identify key areas in which financial consolidation requires new or accelerated policy development. The diversity of the economies involved--even among the G-10, Australia, and Spain--and the interdependent nature of many of the forces affecting our financial systems made achieving these objectives difficult, to say the least. However, I believe the study was a success. Patterns and Causes With a study of the depth, breadth, and quite frankly, the length of this one, it is always potentially dangerous and even possibly misleading to summarize the key points in a few words. However, I believe that policymakers should communicate to a wide audience their thinking on important policy concerns, and thereby stimulate and contribute to dialogues in the public and private sectors. Thus, despite the risks, I would like to highlight what are, in my judgment, the study's key findings and policy implications. The report documents that, in the nations studied, a high level of merger and acquisition activity occurred during the 1990s among financial firms, defined to include depository institutions, securities firms, and insurance companies. During the decade, approximately 7,500 transactions, valued at roughly $1.6 trillion, were consummated. Moreover, the pace of consolidation increased over time, including a noticeable acceleration in the last three years of the decade. For example, the annual number of deals increased threefold during the 1990s, and the total value of deals increased almost tenfold. In Europe, roughly two-thirds of merger and acquisition activity, as measured by the value of the European firm acquired, occurred during the decade's last three years. Using a variety of measures, the United States accounted for about 55 percent of M&A activity, partly because of our historically large number of relatively small financial firms. However, it is also true that many very large U.S. banking institutions expanded their geographic footprint by acquiring other very large banks, especially later in the decade. Most of the last decade's merger and acquisition activity in the financial sector involved banking organizations. Acquisitions of banking firms accounted for 60 percent of all financial mergers and 70 percent of the value of those mergers in the nations studied. In addition, most M&A transactions involved firms competing in the same segment of the financial services industry within the same country, while domestic mergers involving firms in different segments of the overall financial services industry were the second most common type of transaction. Cross-border mergers and acquisitions were less frequent, especially those involving firms in different industry segments. Still, all types of mergers and acquisitions, whether within one country or cross-border and whether within one industry segment or across segments, increased in frequency and value during the 1990s. Joint ventures and strategic alliances provide an interesting contrast with some of the patterns in outright mergers and acquisitions. As with M&A activity, the number of joint ventures and strategic alliances increased during the 1990s, with especially large increases in the last two years. In the United States, which accounted for nearly half of all joint ventures and strategic alliances, the arrangements were overwhelmingly domestic. However, in the other twelve countries studied, cross-border joint ventures and strategic alliances overall exceeded domestic deals. Our research shows that financial consolidation substantially decreased the number of banking firms during the 1990s in almost every nation studied, and measures of the national concentration of the banking industry have tended to rise. Still, at the national level, the structure of the banking industry continues to differ greatly, ranging from very unconcentrated in a few nations--the United States and Germany--to highly concentrated in about half of the nations in our study. In contrast to banking, there are no consistent patterns across countries in changes in the number of insurance firms or concentration in the insurance industry during the 1990s. Within the securities industry, several specific activities, such as certain types of underwriting, are dominated by a small number of leading institutions. It is unclear, however, whether this pattern changed much over the 1990s. One of the most important conclusions of our study is that financial consolidation has helped to create a significant number of large, and in some cases increasingly complex, financial institutions. In addition, these firms increasingly operate across national borders and are subject to a wide range of regulatory regimes. These observations have several important implications that I shall return to in a moment. Our work finds that the most important forces encouraging financial consolidation are improvements in information technology, financial deregulation, globalization of financial and nonfinancial markets, and increased shareholder pressure for financial performance. Because we expect these forces to continue, we expect financial consolidation to continue as well, even though the pace may be interrupted by swings in the macroeconomic cycle and other factors. The study considers few possible future scenarios but concludes that the likelihood of specific future developments is impossible to assess with confidence. My own guess is that various patterns will emerge. Globally active universal financial service providers will continue to emerge. We should also see the further development of firms specialized in the production of particular components of financial services or in the distribution to end-users of products obtained from specialized providers--providers that may exist within or outside the traditional financial services industry. I fully expect a large number of efficient and profitable small and medium-sized financial institutions to remain important players in the United States. I would guess this will also be the case in many other nations. In addition, the uncertainties of successful post-merger integration may well favor more use of looser forms of consolidation, such as joint ventures and strategic alliances. Monetary Policy One of our more important policy concerns in designing the study was the potential effect of financial consolidation on the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy. The study finds, however, that financial consolidation has not significantly affected the ability of central banks to achieve the objectives of monetary policy. Why is this? Although the answer is somewhat complex, let me try to explain briefly. As part of our research, we asked central banks in all the study nations about their experiences with consolidation and monetary policy. Virtually all reported that they had experienced at most minor effects, and those that had experienced somewhat stronger effects had been able to adjust with little difficulty. A key reason for this finding is that even with the substantial consolidation we have observed, the financial markets important for monetary policy have generally remained highly competitive. Even in those nations where consolidation has been considerable, competitive behavior has generally been sustained by the possibility that new firms could enter the markets at relatively low cost. It is also well worth noting that our work suggests that the development of the euro has been particularly helpful in maintaining competition in Europe. The euro has encouraged development of European money and capital markets, thus making the number of participants in a particular nation's markets less relevant. Consolidation could, at least in theory, affect the way changes in monetary policy are transmitted to the real economy. For example, consolidation could potentially alter the way banks adjust the availability and pricing of credit to their customers as the central bank changes the stance of monetary policy. However, central banks generally indicated that such effects had not been observed. Moreover, frequent reviews of the data should allow central banks to take account of any future changes when setting policy. On balance, and despite these quite positive results, our study recommends that central banks should remain alert to the implications of any future reductions in the competitiveness of the markets most important for monetary policy implementation. Similarly, we suggest that central banks ought to monitor potential future effects on the transmission mechanisms for monetary policy. Monetary policy is simply too important to the health of all our economies to do otherwise. Financial Risk Financial consolidation can affect the risks to both individual financial institutions and the financial system as a whole. Importantly, our study concludes that existing policies appear adequate to contain individual firm and systemic risks now and in the intermediate term. However, looking further ahead, the study identifies several topics that deserve careful attention by policymakers. For example, we conclude that the potential effects of financial consolidation on the risk of individual financial institutions are mixed and that the net result is impossible to generalize. Thus, we must evaluate individual firm risk on a case-by-case basis. Consolidation seems most likely to reduce risk through diversification gains, although even here the possibilities are complex. On the one hand, diversification gains seem likely from consolidation across regions of a given nation and across national borders. On the other hand, after consolidation some firms shift toward riskier asset portfolios, and consolidation may increase operating risks and managerial complexities for those firms. Diversification gains may also result from consolidation across financial products and services, although research suggests that the potential benefits may be fairly limited. In part because the net impact of consolidation on individual firm risk is unclear, the net impact of consolidation on systemic risk is also uncertain. However, as I noted consolidation clearly has encouraged the creation of a number of large and increasingly complex financial institutions. Our study suggests that if such an institution became seriously distressed, consolidation and any attendant complexity might increase the chance that winding down the organization would be difficult or disorderly. We recommend that the risks to individual firms and to the financial system could be reduced by stepped-up efforts to understand the implications of working out a large and complex financial institution. Because no institution is too big to fail, I believe that regulators should develop a clearer understanding of, for example, the administration of bankruptcy laws and conventions across borders; the coordination of supervisory policies within and across borders; the treatment of over-the-counter derivatives, foreign exchange, and other "market" activities in distress situations; the roles and responsibilities of managers and boards of directors; and the administration of the lender-of-last-resort function. I say stepped-up discussions are needed in some of these areas because considering adverse developments is or should be a normal activity in all countries. Our study helped to clarify the need for international attention to this topic. Consolidation, and especially any resulting increased complexity of financial institutions, appears to have increased both the demand by market participants for and the supply by institutions of information regarding a firm's financial condition. The resulting rise in disclosures has probably improved firm transparency and encouraged market discipline and has thus lowered individual firm risk and perhaps increased financial stability. However, the increased complexity of firms has also made them more opaque, and their increased size has the potential to augment moral hazard. Thus, the net effect of consolidation on firm transparency and market discipline is unclear. Indeed, we conclude that there appears to be considerable room for improvement in disclosures by financial institutions. Our study suggests that both crisis prevention and crisis management could be improved by additional communication and cooperation among central banks, finance ministries, and other financial supervisors, domestically and internationally. Indeed, the study strongly supports existing efforts in these areas. In our view, the most important initiatives include proposals to improve the risk sensitivity of the international Basel Capital Accord and bank supervision and efforts aimed at improving market discipline. A critical element of improved risk-based supervision is risk-based capital standards that are tied more closely to economic risk. Capital standards provide an anchor for virtually all other supervisory and regulatory actions and can support and improve both supervisory and market discipline. For example, early intervention policies triggered by more accurate capital standards could prove to be important in crisis prevention. Payment and Settlement Systems Financial consolidation is affecting the market structures for payment and securities settlement as well as banks' internal systems and procedures for payment and back-office activities. Our study concludes that, on balance, financial consolidation has led to a greater concentration of payment and settlement flows among fewer parties. Fortunately, our analysis indicates that the greater concentration of payment flows does not appear to have decreased competition in markets for payment and settlement services. However, we suggest that it would be advisable for government authorities to continue to monitor competition in the payment system. In contrast, our work indicates we should closely monitor the risk implications of consolidation in payment and settlement systems. On the one hand, consolidation may help to improve the effectiveness of institutions' credit and liquidity risk controls. For example, increased concentration of payment flows may allow institutions to get a more comprehensive picture of settlement exposures or create a greater ability to net internal payment flows. In addition, central banks have made major efforts over recent decades to contain and reduce systemic risk by operating and promoting real-time gross settlement systems and by insisting on the implementation of risk control measures in net settlement systems. On the other hand, consolidation may lead to a significant shift of risk from interbank settlement systems, where risk management may be more robust and transparent, to customer banks and third-party service providers, where risk management practices may be harder for users to discern. In addition, to the extent that consolidation results in a greater concentration of payment flows, the potential effects of an operational problem may increase. These and other developments imply that central bank oversight of the risks in interbank payment systems is becoming more closely linked with traditional supervision of individual institution safety and soundness. As a result, we conclude that increasing cooperation and communication between banking supervisors and payment system overseers may be necessary both domestically and internationally. Efficiency, Competition, and Credit Flows Our study concludes with an extensive evaluation of the potential effects of financial consolidation on the efficiency of financial institutions, competition among such firms, and credit flows to households and small businesses. The study determines that although consolidation has some potential to improve operating efficiency, and has done so in some cases, the overall evidence in favor of efficiency gains is weak. Thus, we suggest that policymakers should carefully examine claims of substantial efficiency gains in proposed consolidations, especially in cases where a merger could raise significant issues of market power. Our work also attempts to shed some light on why academic researchers are less optimistic than business practitioners regarding the potential for consolidation to lead to efficiency gains. We suggest four possible reasons, which are not mutually exclusive. First, practitioners may consider cost reductions or revenue increases per se to be a success, without also taking into account independent industry trends as a benchmark. Second, managers may focus on absolute cost savings rather than on efficiency measures that compare costs to some other variable such as assets or revenues. Third, research finds little or no efficiency improvements on average, but this also means that some institutions may improve efficiency while some suffer from lower efficiency. Managers with inside knowledge of their firm may be justified in believing that their institution might be among those improving efficiency through a merger or acquisition. Lastly, past M&As may have suffered from regulations that reduced the benefits, and such regulations may not exist in the future. The effects of consolidation on competition and credit flows are case-specific and depend on the nature of markets for individual products and services. Some markets, such as those for wholesale financial services, generally show few problems. Others, such as those for retail products and services, sometimes experience problems from consolidation. Thus, as with other issues addressed by our study, a case-by-case evaluation of the relevant facts is required. Conclusion In conclusion, financial consolidation clearly is a powerful force that is deeply affecting the evolution of the financial system of the United States and many other nations. A thorough understanding of this force and its potential effects is critical for prudent decision-making in both the public and the private sectors. I believe the study that I have just summarized takes some major steps toward that understanding, and I hope that my remarks have helped you to comprehend our study's findings and implications. Still, all of us have much to learn, and much of what we know today will almost surely change in the future. I commend the organizers of this conference for seeking to advance our knowledge, and I again thank you for inviting me to contribute.
