For immediate release The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5-3/4 percent. In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent. The Committee remains concerned that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the pronounced rise in productivity growth. Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion. Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future. In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board today approved action by the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis increasing the discount rate at that bank from 5 percent to 5-1/4 percent effective immediately. The Federal Reserve Board also today approved action by the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas increasing the discount rate at that bank from 5 percent to 5-1/4 percent effective Friday, February 4, 2000.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board today announced the execution of a Written Agreement by and among the Bank of New York, New York, New York, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the New York State Banking Department. A copy of the Written Agreement is attached.
Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan Over-the-counter derivatives Before the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, United States Senate February 10, 2000 I am pleased to be here today to underscore the importance of this committee's efforts to modernize the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and to express my support for the recommendations for amending the act that were contained in the report by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets entitled Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act. The Need for Legislation Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives have come to play an exceptionally important role in our financial system and in our economy. These instruments allow users to unbundle risks and allocate them to the investors most willing and able to assume them. A growing number of financial and nonfinancial institutions have embraced derivatives as an integral part of their risk capital allocation and profit maximization. In particular, the profitability of derivative products has been a major factor in the significant gain in the finance industry's share of American corporate output during the past decade--a reflection of their value to nonfinancial industry. Indeed, this value added from derivatives itself derives from their ability to enhance the process of wealth creation throughout our economy. In light of the importance of OTC derivatives, it is essential that we address the legal uncertainties created by the possibility that courts could construe OTC derivatives to be futures contracts subject to the CEA. The legal uncertainties create risks to counterparties in OTC contracts and, indeed, to our financial system that simply are unacceptable. They have also impeded initiatives to centralize the trading and clearing of OTC contracts, developments that have the potential to increase efficiency and reduce risks in OTC transactions. As I shall discuss more fully later in my remarks, rapid changes in communications technology portend that time is running out for us to modernize our regulation of financial markets before we lose them and the associated profits and employment opportunities to foreign jurisdictions that impose no such impediments. To be sure, the Congress and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have taken steps to address these concerns about the CEA. The Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 gave the CFTC authority to exempt OTC derivatives from most provisions of the act. In early 1993 the CFTC used that authority to create an exemption for OTC derivatives that reduced legal uncertainty for a wide range of transactions and counterparties. Unfortunately, some subsequent actions by the Commission called into question market participants' understanding of the terms of the 1993 exemption. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Rainer, the Commission is considering reaffirming and expanding the terms of the 1993 exemption. Nonetheless, even with such an important and constructive step by the Commission, legislation amending the CEA would remain critically important. The greatest legal uncertainty affecting existing OTC transactions is in the area of securities-based contracts, where the CFTC's exemptive authority is constrained. Furthermore, as events during the past few years have clearly demonstrated, regulatory exemptions, unlike statutory exclusions, carry the risk of amendment by future Commissions. Principles of Regulation Imposing government regulation on a market can impair its efficiency. Thus, when evaluating the need for government regulation, one must clearly identify the public policy objectives of the regulation. As the working group's report discusses, the primary public policy purposes of the CEA are to deter market manipulation and to protect investors against fraud and other unfair practices. We must of course assess whether government regulation is necessary to achieve those objectives. The regulatory framework of the CEA was designed for the trading of grain futures by the general public, including retail investors. Because quantities of grain following a harvest are generally known and limited, it is possible, at least in principle, to manipulate the price of grain by cornering a market. Furthermore, grain futures prices are widely disseminated and widely used as the basis for pricing grain transactions off the futures exchanges. The fact that grain futures serve such a price-discovery function means that if attempts to corner a market result in price fluctuations, the effects would be felt widely by producers and consumers of grain. OTC Derivatives The President's working group has considered whether regulation of OTC derivatives is necessary to achieve these public policy objectives of the CEA. In the case of financial OTC derivatives transactions between professional counterparties, the working group has agreed that such regulation is unnecessary and that such transactions should be excluded from coverage of the act. Importantly, the recommended exclusion would extend to those securities-based derivatives that currently are subject to the greatest legal risk from potential application of the CEA. The rationale for this position is straightforward. OTC transactions in financial derivatives are not susceptible to--that is, easily influenced by--manipulation. The vast majority of contracts are settled in cash, based on a rate or price determined in a separate highly liquid market with a very large or virtually unlimited deliverable supply. Furthermore, prices established in OTC transactions do not serve a price-discovery function. Thus, even if the price of an OTC contract were somehow manipulated, the adverse effects on the economy would be quite limited. With respect to fraud and other unfair practices, the professional counterparties that use OTC derivatives simply do not require the protections that CEA provides for retail investors. If professional counterparties are victimized, they can obtain redress under the laws applicable to contracts generally. The working group also considered whether the introduction of centralized mechanisms for the trading and settling of what heretofore have been purely bilaterally negotiated and settled transactions would give rise to a need for additional regulation. In the case of electronic trading systems, the working group concluded that regulation under the CEA was unnecessary and that such systems should be excluded from the act, provided that the contracts are not based on nonfinancial commodities with finite supplies and that the participants are limited to sophisticated counterparties trading solely for their own accounts. Electronic trading of such contracts by such counterparties, it was reasoned, would be no more susceptible to problems of manipulation and fraud than purely bilateral transactions. It was suggested that some limited regulation of such systems might become necessary in the future if such trading systems came to serve a price-discovery function. But it was agreed that creation of a regulatory system for such systems in anticipation of problems was inappropriate. As I have already noted, the vast majority of OTC derivatives simply are not susceptible to manipulation. Thus, even if those contracts come to play a role in price discovery, regulation of the trading mechanism might still be unnecessary. In the case of clearing systems for OTC derivatives, the working group concluded that government oversight is appropriate. Clearing tends to concentrate risks and responsibilities for risk management in a central party or clearinghouse. Consequently, the effectiveness of the clearinghouse's risk management is critical for the stability of the markets that it serves. Depending on the types of transactions cleared, such oversight might appropriately be conducted by the CFTC under the CEA. Alternatively, it might be conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or a foreign financial regulator that one of the U.S. regulators has determined satisfies appropriate standards. Provided such government oversight is in place, OTC transactions that would otherwise be excluded from the CEA should not fall within the ambit of the act because they are cleared. If market participants conclude that clearing would reduce counterparty risks in OTC transactions, concerns about legal risks associated with the potential application of the CEA should not stand in their way. Traditional Exchanges The working group's report does not make specific recommendations about the regulation of traditional exchange-traded futures markets that use open outcry trading or that allow trading by retail investors. Nevertheless, it calls for a review of the existing regulatory structures, particularly those applicable to financial futures, to ensure that they are appropriate in light of the objectives of the act. Consistent with the principles of regulation that I identified earlier, the report notes that exchange-traded futures should not be subject to regulations that are unnecessary to achieve the CEA's objectives. The report also concludes that the current prohibition on single-stock futures can be repealed if issues about the integrity of the underlying securities market and regulatory arbitrage are resolved. I want to underscore how important it is for us to address these issues promptly. I cannot claim to speak with certainty as to how our complex and rapidly moving markets will evolve. But I see a real risk that, if we fail to rationalize our regulation of centralized trading mechanisms for financial instruments, these markets and the related profits and employment opportunities will be lost to foreign jurisdictions that maintain the confidence of global investors without imposing so many regulatory constraints. My concerns on this score stem from the dramatic advances in information technology that we see all around us. In markets with significant economies of scale and scope, like those for standardized financial instruments, there is a tendency toward consolidation or even natural monopoly. Throughout much of our history this tendency has been restrained by an inability to communicate information sufficiently quickly, cheaply, and accurately. In recent years, however, this constraint is being essentially eliminated by advances in telecommunications. We have not yet seen clear evidence of a trend toward natural monopoly. But the diffusion of technology often traces an S-shaped curve, first diffusing slowly, but then rapidly picking up speed. Once we reach the steep segment of that S-curve, it may be too late to rationalize our regulatory structure. Already the largest futures exchange in the world is no longer in the American heartland; instead, it is now in the heart of Europe. To be sure, no U.S. exchange has yet to lose a major contract to a foreign competitor. But it would be a serious mistake for us to wait for such unmistakable evidence of a loss of international competitiveness before acting. As our experience with the vast eurodollar markets demonstrates, once markets with scale and scope economies are lost, they are very difficult, if not impossible, to recapture.

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision AGENCIES PROPOSE REVISION OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES' TREATMENT OF RECOURSE AND DIRECT-CREDIT SUBSTITUTES The four federal banking agencies today released proposed revisions to their risk-based capital requirements for certain obligations related to securitized transactions. The proposal by the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Office of Thrift Supervision is intended to produce more consistent capital treatment for credit risks associated with exposures arising from securitization transactions. It would amend the risk-based capital requirements for asset-backed securities as well as recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes. Public comment is requested by May 26, 2000 . In securitizations, assets such as residential and commercial mortgages, credit-card receivables and automobile loans are pooled and reconstituted into securities. Securitizations typically carve up the credit risks from underlying assets and redistribute them to different parties. Sellers of assets into a securitization may retain part of the risk of credit loss through recourse arrangements. Sellers also may arrange for a third party, such as a banking organization, to accept some of the credit risk through guarantees, referred to as direct credit substitutes. The proposed revisions would: Assign a risk-based charge to positions in securitized transactions according to the relative credit risk of those positions, as measured by credit ratings received from nationally recognized rating agencies. Treat recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes more consistently under risk-based capital rules. Define "recourse" and revise the definition of "direct credit substitute." Permit the limited use of an institution's internal risk-rating system and other alternative approaches in determining the risk-based capital requirement for unrated direct credit substitutes associated with asset-backed commercial paper programs and other structured finance programs. Require banking organizations to hold additional risk-based capital against risks presented by the early amortization feature of revolving asset securitizations. The interagency proposal published today incorporates many of the industry comments received in response to an earlier version published in November 1997. A consultative paper issued in June 1999 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision considers a similar approach to that contained in this proposal. The preamble of the agencies' notice of proposed rulemaking is attached. The full notice will be published in the Federal Register.

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System United States Mint U.S. Mint and Federal Reserve Announce Program For Direct Shipment of Golden Dollars To Small Financial Institutions --Online Ordering to Begin on March 1, 2000-- The United States Mint and the Federal Reserve today announced a program to provide direct shipments of Golden Dollars to community banks, credit unions, and savings and loans across the country. Strong public demand for the new dollar coin has generated thousands of orders from banks and retailers and led some banks to create Golden Dollar waiting lists for their individual and commercial customers. "The U.S. Mint and the Federal Reserve have developed this program to accelerate shipments of Golden Dollars to small financial institutions," said Philip N. Diehl, director of the Mint. "We want to get as many Golden Dollars to these institutions as quickly as possible. This program is designed to augment, not replace, the routine delivery of coins through the Federal Reserve System." Depository institutions should continue to place regular orders for Golden Dollars with the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs). "We expect to produce at least 150 million Golden Dollars in March - about 100 million for distribution through the Federal Reserve System and up to 50 million for direct shipment to small financial institutions," Diehl said. "No FRB orders will be reduced to supply Golden Dollars to financial institutions that participate in the temporary direct-shipment program." By the end of March, the Mint expects it will have placed 350 million Golden Dollars into circulation - about 200 million through the Federal Reserve System and the rest through direct shipment to retailers and small financial institutions. It recently doubled Golden Dollar production to five million a day. The new program provides for direct shipment from the Mint of 1,000 or 2,000 Golden Dollars to community banks, credit unions, and savings and loans. The American Bankers Association, America's Community Bankers, Credit Union National Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, and the National Federation of Federal Credit Unions also are participating by assisting the Mint in informing the industry of the program. Orders will be accepted through the Mint's secure Web site March 1 through March 31. Only financial institutions may participate in this program, and the U.S. Mint will validate orders. Delivery is expected to require five to ten business days, and orders will be shipped on a first come basis. Coin will be shipped in rolls of 25 coins.

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System U.S. Department of the Treasury U.S. EFFORTS TO COMBAT GLOBAL COUNTERFEITING ARE WORKING Efforts to combat international counterfeiting of U.S. currency are working, according to a Treasury Department and Federal Reserve Board report released on Tuesday. ï¿½Our efforts to make the U.S. currency as secure as possible are working,ï¿½ said Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. ï¿½By combating global counterfeiting we can ensure that our currency will remain a symbol of our strength and stability.ï¿½ ï¿½The currency of the United States represents the strength and dependability of our economy and the financial system that supports it. As such, its integrity must be carefully protected," said Edward W. Kelley, Jr., member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. "This study indicates that the new-design notes have been quite successful in thwarting counterfeiters. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has detected a considerably smaller proportion of counterfeit notes among genuine new-design notes than among older-design notes.ï¿½ The report, The Use and Counterfeiting of United States Currency Abroad, mandated by Congress as part of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and conducted by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, is a comprehensive review of the international use and counterfeiting of U.S. currency. The efforts to protect U.S. currency have been effective. The incidence of counterfeiting is low both inside and outside the United States but slightly higher outside the United States, with approximately one note per 10,000 counterfeit worldwide. The U.S. Secret Service is working closely with overseas banks and law enforcement agencies to help suppress counterfeiting activities. The report highlighted important steps the U.S. Government is currently taking to combat global counterfeiting: A pilot Secret Service website allows law enforcement agencies and currency handlers worldwide to report instances of counterfeiting. Through its extended custodial inventory program, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has established overseas cash depots at foreign banks. By lowering transportation costs, these facilities allow overseas dollar users to more efficiently obtain new U.S. currency and return worn and old-design U.S. currency. U.S. enforcement agencies are working with their overseas counterparts to target cities and countries that first receive counterfeit notes in the wholesale distribution chain. The study concluded that between $250 billion and $350 billion of the $500 billion of U.S. currency in circulation was held overseas at the end of 1998. According to the report, technology will continue to require new and innovative responses to maintain the security of U.S. currency. These efforts will include: further security enhancements to our currency design, enhanced cooperation with international law enforcement agencies and additional training of foreign law enforcement and financial officials in counterfeit detection. The report is available through the Treasury Office of Public Affairs at (202) 622-2960 or the Federal Reserve Office of Public Affairs at (202) 452-2955 or via the Internet at www.treas.gov/press.
