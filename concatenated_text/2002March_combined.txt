Remarks by Governor Edward M. Gramlich Lending to lower-income households At the National Community Reinvestment Coalition 11th Annual Conference, Washington, D.C. March 1, 2002
Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. Before the Institute of International Bankers, Washington, D.C. March 4, 2002 A Supervisory Perspective on Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Good morning. I would like to thank the members of the Institute of International Bankers for the opportunity to speak about disaster recovery and business continuity. This topic has been receiving a great deal of attention at the Federal Reserve and in the financial industry as a whole since September11. It's fair to say that following September 11, we (bankers and supervisors alike) have a renewed appreciation of the meaning of the term "emergency preparedness." The Federal Reserve and other regulators, both here and abroad, have been analyzing the aftermath of the terrorist attacks with a view toward strengthening the overall resilience of the financial system. This work has benefited from discussions with leading members of the financial services industry over the past several months. In this presentation, I want to give you a flavor of the ideas and issues under review. Since many of you had first-hand experience of the impact of September 11, I do not intend to dwell on the details of the operational breakdowns and related challenges that faced institutions in lower Manhattan. Suffice it to say that, through a fortuitous combination of existing plans, people, systems, and tools and an extraordinary level of cooperation among market participants, the financial system recovered remarkably quickly from the tragedy. However, we cannot assume that the same combination will always work in our favor, and therefore, regulators and the public have a strong common interest in learning from our horrific experience of September 11. What Did We Learn? Let me review some of the key lessons that we believe have emerged from September 11. First, business continuity planning at many institutions, although improved by Y2K preparations, clearly had not fully taken into account the potential for wide-spread disasters and for the major loss or inaccessibility of critical staff. Some firms arranged for their backup facilities to be in nearby buildings for quite legitimate efficiency and convenience, and, as a result, lost both primary and backup sites. Very few firms planned for an emergency that would disrupt multiple sites in an entire business district, city, or region. Second, business concentrations, both market-based and geographic, intensified the impact of operational disruptions. Besides the geographic concentration of financial institutions within New York City, some critical market functions, particularly in the clearing and settlement of funds, securities, and financial contracts, rely on only a few entities. When even one of those entities has operational problems, many market participants feel the effects. Moreover, significant telecommunications vulnerabilities resulting from concentrations became evident when failures affected numerous institutions, both within and outside lower Manhattan. In fact, Federal Reserve staff were personally involved in setting priorities for the restoration of key telecommunications circuits supporting the financial services system during the week of September 11. Third, the events of September 11 graphically demonstrated the interdependence among financial-system participants, wherever located. Though organizations located outside the New York City area were affected much less than those within it, many felt the effects of the disaster. The difficulty customers and counterparties had in communicating with banks, broker-dealers, and other organizations in lower Manhattan seriously impeded their ability to determine whether transactions had been completed as expected. In some cases, some customers were affected by actions of institutions with which they did not even do business, for example, when funds or securities could not be delivered because of operational problems at other institutions. In fact, during the week of September 11 liquidity bottlenecks at times became so severe that the Federal Reserve needed to lend substantial amounts directly to institutions through the discount window, besides providing billions more in payment system float on uncleared checks, and through open market operations. We kept our payment systems open until nearly midnight each night that week as institutions attempted to clear out payment queues. Heightened liquidity needs were not limited to domestic financial institutions. The Federal Reserve set up swap lines with other major central banks to allow foreign banking organizations to obtain liquidity directly from their own authorities, to prevent U.S. liquidity imbalances from being transmitted overseas. Most important, we learned, as a result of these interdependencies, that contingency-planning decisions made by an individual institution may affect not only the safety and soundness of that institution but also the safety and soundness of other institutions and, indeed, the very functioning of the financial markets. As a result, we believe that coordinated discussions of sound practices for business continuity involving the financial industry and regulators are an important part of our response to the events of September 11. Steps Financial Institutions Are Taking Let me turn to steps that institutions are taking to improve their own preparedness and business continuity planning. September 11 may lead to changes in institutions' planning for emergencies, as well as changes in their ongoing operations. In addition to a range of tactical steps, such as enhancing security measures, updating communication plans, and strengthening real-time data backup, institutions also are making some interesting strategic choices. For example, many institutions use a traditional model of business continuity that is based on an "active" operating site with a corresponding backup site, often with separate sites for data processing and for business operations. This strategy generally relies on relocating staff from the active site to the backup site and on maintaining backup copies of technology and data that are up-to-date. In the traditional model, backup capabilities are ensured through periodic testing. Even so, maintaining the effectiveness of backup sites, staff, and systems that are not routinely used for production is often difficult. For example, during the week of September 11, many institutions found that disaster-recovery plans of particular business lines were not always accessible or up-to-date, and sometimes the backup and primary sites used different hardware and software versions. Finally, the assumption that key personnel could be relocated was not always well founded. In contrast, some institutions are now moving toward a "split operations" model, in which two or more active operating sites provide backup for one another. Each site can absorb some or all of the work of another for an extended time. For banking organizations with nationwide operations (particularly those that have grown through mergers), such sites are often hundreds of miles apart. For international firms, routine workloads can be shared among sites in different countries or different continents. This strategy can provide almost-immediate resumption capacity, depending on the systems supporting the operations and the communications and operating capacity at each site. The strategy also addresses many of the key vulnerabilities of the traditional model. For example, technology must be kept current at all active operating sites for normal business operations to proceed. At the same time, the split-operations approach can have significant costs, in terms of maintaining excess capacity at each site and of adding operating complexity. This approach may be more suited to some types of business activities, such as trading, clearing, and settlement, than to others. Other business-continuity models may be able to provide a high degree of resilience. Over time, technological change will significantly affect the range of business continuity strategies and, importantly, their relative costs and benefits. Whatever operating model they chose, financial institutions clearly are reassessing the range of scenarios they need to address in their business-continuity planning. Such scenarios posit effects on business operations over much broader geographic areas than previously imagined (such as a city or a metropolitan area) and involve consequences that could harm or significantly disperse an organization's critical employees. Institutions are also exploring methods to provide a greater diversity of telecommunications services and to eliminate points of failure. Contract provisions and audit oversight of telecommunications vendors may heighten attention to this critical vulnerability. At the same time, many recognize that overcoming telecommunications vulnerabilities will be extremely difficult given the current physical infrastructure. In the longer term, establishing diverse telecommunications methods (such as Internet and wireless) and moving toward wider geographic diversification of operations may address these vulnerabilities. Industrywide discussions with telecommunications providers may help institutions to avoid some of the vulnerabilities exposed on September 11. Some institutions are reexamining arrangements with disaster-recovery vendors because they have found that these vendors' "first-come, first-served" policies mean just that. Testing of backup plans is also receiving renewed focus. Testing is seen no longer as a compliance issue or an item on a checklist but as a critical part of business operations. In the wake of September 11, many market participants found themselves operating from their backup sites and discovered they had problems connecting and communicating with the backup sites of other displaced entities. As a result, financial institutions now seem receptive to coordinated testing between backup facilities. In addition, several public and private-sector initiatives have begun to examine the issue of coordinated crisis management communication. Overall, I believe that financial institutions are addressing many of the key vulnerabilities. In large part, the market will demand this. Customers increasingly require assurances that their financial institutions' operations will continue as expected even in the event of a disaster. We need to maintain our focus on this issue even as the harsh memories of September 11 fade. We must also find ways to make business-continuity planning more consistent, more coordinated, and more transparent across the industry. With that in mind, I will discuss some of the steps that regulators are taking. Steps Regulators Are Taking The Federal Reserve and other financial services regulators want these lessons to be addressed before the next disaster, whenever and whatever it may strike. First, we are talking to our industry colleagues about appropriate sound practices. However, I would stress that we still have a lot to learn from financial institutions and from experts in business-continuity planning. No one knows for certain which threats (both man-made and natural) we are most likely to face in the coming years. We have much less experience modeling and predicting these operational risks than we do credit or market risks, and indeed some threats may be too idiosyncratic to be modeled at all. As a result, a prudential supervisory model appears preferable at this time. Through the routine supervisory process, we are talking to institutions about the robustness of their disaster-recovery planning but are stopping short of setting detailed regulatory standards at this point. Although I anticipate that we will issue updated supervisory guidance and examination procedures for business continuity before long, I am not certain that we want to approach this issue with a checklist. In this process, we are working closely with other regulators, including the other federal banking regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cities and regions outside New York City are not without risk and also need to consider reasonable threats, both man-made and natural. I am therefore pleased that many institutions in those cities and towns, like their colleagues based in New York City are seriously considering updating and implementing business-continuity plans. Institutions also need to define their targets for recovery from a disaster in a consistent manner. Although in practice, expectations for recovery time may differ depending on the scenario, some critical functions, including those safeguarding and transferring funds and financial assets, are so vital to the domestic and global financial system that they arguably should continue with minimal, if any, disruption, even in the event of a major regional disaster. Clearly, all institutions need to plan to continue serving their customers in a major disruption, and supervisory standards have required them to do so for many years. In addition, it is increasingly clear that the operational resilience of the largest institutions in key markets needs to reflect their systemic impact across the financial sector. Expectations should be highest for institutions whose activity can significantly affect other institutions, such as major clearing and settlement entities, and institutions that act as financial "utilities" in some of their functions. However, we need to balance competing issues. We have an ongoing interest in the safety and soundness of individual institutions, as well as in systemic financial stability. But we also recognize that, even though the largest nationally and internationally active U.S. and foreign banking institutions have a key role to play in financial stability, they also participate in a competitive marketplace. Thus, we need to be careful not to create undue burden on a handful of institutions. Conclusion Six months after September 11, much has been planned and achieved, but we still have much to do. We must sustain the current drive to minimize or eliminate the vulnerabilities I have discussed. We must view September 11 as a wake-up call to improve the resilience of financial markets and institutions. We cannot afford to ignore the lessons learned. I ask for your cooperation in what we view as a partnership. We were there for those who needed us on September 11 and in the days that followed, and we will be there again, if necessary. But we also look to financial institutions to conduct an honest appraisal of their vulnerabilities--or to listen to our appraisal of them in our routine supervision over the institutions' U.S. operations--and to take the necessary actions to remedy any significant operational weaknesses and deficiencies. I wish us all the best in this endeavor.
Remarks by Governor Edward M. Gramlich At the Conference on Combating Recessions, Ford School of Public Policy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan March 7, 2002 Governor Gramlich presented identical remarks at the Economic Department Lecture, Lake Forest College, Chicago, Illinois, April 12, 2002 Macroeconomic Policy in Recessions--and Other Times According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the U.S. economy entered its tenth postwar recession early this year. At this point, and according to the Blue Chip forecasters, the recession seems to have been much milder than most, with the unemployment rate unlikely to go much above 6 percent. But in the early fall there were moments when the risk of a serious downturn was much greater, and even the relatively flat 2001 recession prompted renewed policy discussions about how to deal with recessions. Today, I offer my own views on the subject. For obvious reasons, I will avoid an evaluation of specific actions or pieces of legislation and just discuss a general strategy. My central point is that putting in place a sensible long-term macroeconomic policy strategy, covering both fiscal and monetary policy, is extremely important. The main importance of such a strategy involves the effects of the policy position on trend economic growth, not recessions or expansions. Business-cycle movements obviously have to be dealt with, but for the most part they can be addressed through the existing system of fiscal and monetary shock absorbers. At times, these shock absorbers may have to be augmented with discretionary antirecessionary fiscal actions, but these times are relatively rare. And the discretionary antirecessionary fiscal actions should meet stringent criteria to make sure that they do more good than harm. Sound Long-Run Policies The fundamental reason for establishing a sound long-run macroeconomic policy strategy is that the path of trend productivity growth is a nation's most crucial economic variable. It determines the long-run growth of living standards and is a main determinant of the affordability of entitlement spending programs, the level of household wealth, the value of the currency, and other economic magnitudes. Whatever policy does in response to short-term needs, that policy should be formulated in the context of a sound overall long-run strategy. The path of trend productivity growth has many underlying determinants--the vibrancy of technology, the strength of entrepreneurial motives, the flexibility of labor and capital markets, and the effectiveness of regulatory policies, to name a few. But there are also two vital macroeconomic policy determinants. One, involving monetary policy, is a credible commitment to stable prices in the long run. The second, involving fiscal policy, concerns the share of total output devoted to national saving. Output that is not devoted to saving will be consumed, and that's that. Output that is saved, or reserved from consumption, will be devoted to capital investment, which equips workers with new capital, enhances productivity, and raises living standards. In recent years, the United States has been the fortunate beneficiary of a productivity growth spurt. Both monetary and fiscal policy have played an important role. The commitment to and realization of stable prices have surely been critical background forces, facilitating long-term planning and a more efficient allocation of resources. On the fiscal side, the role of saving and investment has been important as well. Production-function decompositions of this growth spurt suggest that a good 30 to 40 percent of it has been due to so-called capital-deepening productivity change, reflecting increases in the economy's capital-labor ratio. Fiscal policy is relevant because it helps determine the national saving that finances this capital investment. National saving can be generated privately, by households and business, or by government. Efforts to promote private saving certainly have merit in theory, but the bald empirical fact for the United States is that the government has introduced a number of tax provisions to increase private saving over the past twenty years, and almost all of them have been correlated with a reduction in the overall rate of private saving. These measures could have been effective at the margin, but they have not had a large enough effect to counter the general downward trend in private saving. As an added caution, from a standpoint of national saving, it makes no sense to introduce costly private saving incentives that then reduce government saving more than they raise private saving. What has seemed to raise national saving is government fiscal policy, the budget surpluses. Government saving, or a surplus, leads to a reduction in outstanding government debt to which wealth-holders, for the most part, seem to respond by devoting the funds to private credit markets. This response, in turn, finances capital investment. Much of this capital investment is likely to be in the United States, directly influencing output and productivity. But even if the saving flows abroad, either through the buying back of foreign-owned capital or the purchase of new capital in foreign countries, the United States gets the returns on this investment, which raise income growth and future consumption. The only instance in which government surpluses do not raise national saving is the so-called Ricardian equivalence scenario. In this scenario, households learn that the government plans to run a surplus, and they reduce their own saving by their proportionate share of this surplus. In general, economists find that if Ricardian offsets exist at all, they are a modest share of the relevant government surpluses. At a more casual level, I have, for many years surveyed my non-economist friends to see how they alter their own consumption behavior in response to national fiscal policy. The usual response is a blank stare: If these non-economists have even imagined there to be a connection between government deficits and their own saving, they have no idea how much to respond and in what direction. Fiscal Policy What, then, is the long-run fiscal policy that leads to a vibrant economy with a high rate of productivity growth? In general, it implies nudging the economy in the direction of raising the overall rate of national saving. It is theoretically possible for an economy to save so much that the long-term path of consumption per capita is actually lowered, but generally economists believe that the U.S. economy is well short of that saturation point. For the present circumstances, I am proceeding on the assumption that more saving is better. I start by decomposing the federal budget into two components, the cash surplus of the trust funds for social security and some other entitlement programs, and the net surplus for all other activities of government, which I will call the general budget surplus. For the general budget surplus, let me repeat a very simple rule, similar to that enunciated by both the Committee for Economic Development and Milton Friedman fifty years ago. The rule is that the general budget surplus should average zero over the long run. This general budget should not be exactly balanced each year, but there should be long-run balance. In the event of a recession, for example, it is natural, and actually healthy, for revenues to fall, spending to rise, and the general budget to move into deficit. This deficit helps prop up the economy in the recession, which is why these budgetary movements are called automatic fiscal stabilizers. But though deficits are excusable in a recession, they are not desirable in general. If the following period sees an expansion, the general budget should move into surplus, and over time the general budget surplus should average zero. Indeed, the long-term value of higher national saving gives an argument for aiming at a positive general budget surplus on average, but I will not push that argument here because it is most likely a political nonstarter. For the surpluses of the entitlement program trust funds, covering social security, Medicare, and the retirement benefits of government employees, one would follow a different rule. These trust funds are set up to finance long-term entitlement expenditures. To illustrate, for social security, the largest of these entitlement programs, revenue from worker payroll taxes go into a trust fund and, along with any earnings on asset holdings, are used to pay retiree benefits. These trust funds should then be evaluated on an actuarial basis--whether present and future anticipated inflows are adequate to pay anticipated present and future program benefits. If not, corrective steps should be taken. Again using social security as an example, inflows currently exceed outflows (a cash surplus), but forecast inflows do not cover forecast outflows (an actuarial deficit). Even though the fund has a cash surplus today, some combination of tax increases or long-term cuts in benefits is needed to maintain these surpluses into the future and to restore actuarial soundness. This situation is not atypical for countries like the United States with an aging population. For a country with an aging population, the combination of a general budget surplus that is zero on average and trust funds in cash surplus will normally lead to surpluses in the overall, or unified, budget. These surpluses can be rationalized as a technique to build up the nation's future capital stock. Since the population is aging, a relatively small cohort of workers will soon have to pay benefits for a relatively large cohort of retirees, and the idea is at least to give this small cohort of workers a larger capital stock to work with. Having this type of a budget policy accomplishes three objectives simultaneously: The surpluses provide for capital accumulation. They do that to a greater extent the more the country's population is aging. Automatic fiscal stabilizers remain to deal with recessions. The discussion to this point has been entirely in terms of the federal budget. In principle, state governments could follow the same countercyclical fiscal policy, except for one problem. States typically operate under legislative or constitutional limits on their deficits. The only way states could run deficits in recessions is if they had saved a store of assets in earlier booms. This presaving strategy sounds nice in principle and is a good idea, but very few states actually follow it to a sufficient degree. So, as state budget situations worsen because of the state automatic fiscal stabilizers, the unfortunate but likely result is that states will lack the rainy day resources to run deficits and will need to make budget changes that neutralize their own automatic stabilizers. Monetary Policy The automatic fiscal stabilizers help in stabilizing the economy over the business cycle, but the main burden of fighting recessions is left to the central bank. Traditionally there have been two reasons for this: Monetary policy responds to shocks much more quickly than fiscal policy. It is generally believed that, if an economy is open to foreign trade and capital flows and has flexible exchange rates, monetary policy becomes more effective in fighting cycles whereas fiscal policy becomes less effective. To be sure, one can raise questions about the second reason--the argument hinges on the fact that the value of the domestic currency is positively correlated with interest rates, which in recent years has often not seemed to be the case for the United States. But despite any qualms about the second reason, the first reason seems solid for just about any known real world economy. For a long time now, central banks have been trying to stabilize economies, in an art form known as "leaning against the wind." John Taylor has developed an equation that provides one statistical description of how this practice might be followed. Under what is known as the Taylor rule, there is a certain equilibrium position for some short-term interest rate. The central bank uses open market operations to raise the short-term rate above this equilibrium in response to threats of inflation and to lower the rate below equilibrium in response to threats of unemployment. I won't go into details, but if the central bank is willing to announce an inflation target, the policy responses implicit in a Taylor rule could be similar to those implicit in forward-looking, flexible inflation targeting, a policy strategy now used successfully in controlling inflation by about ten leading economies around the world (twenty, if one counts the European Central Bank, which practices a form of inflation targeting). Determining how much central banks should raise short-term interest rates in response to inflation, or lower them in response to recession, or even in response to subpar growth, becomes an empirical matter. However much they do, we have another stabilizer for the economy. As demand growth heats up, the central bank will raise short-term rates to try to limit the boom and the resulting inflation. As recessions threaten, the central bank will lower short-term rates to try to limit the downturn. Discretionary Fiscal Policy? With this long-run strategy in place, and with at least two shock absorbers--one monetary, one fiscal--we are now ready for the sixty-four dollar question. In the average recession, should there be additional discretionary fiscal actions? For such actions to be effective, they must satisfy three conditions: They should stimulate spending. They should be instituted quickly. They should be reversed quickly or automatically. The reason speed and reversibility are important is that most recessions are not very long, averaging about twelve months in the United States. If some expansionary action comes into effect late in a recession, say in the twelfth month, it is likely to add to the vigor of the next expansion and hence increase business-cycle volatility. Reversibility is also important because of the overall budget rule discussed earlier. If the general budget were already in approximate balance, any continuing expansionary fiscal action taken on top of that would generate normal deficits, not normal budget balance. There is a limited set of fiscal actions that satisfy all these conditions. Many of the commonly discussed proposals fall short on at least one ground. By way of illustration, I will discuss a few that have been mentioned in recent debates. Extend unemployment insurance . Unemployment insurance benefits run out after twenty-six weeks in the United States. In general having a time limit to control caseloads is helpful--the basic idea of unemployment insurance is to provide temporary, not permanent, support to unemployed workers. But in recessions, when unemployed workers have much more difficulty in getting new jobs, it may make sense for policy to be more lenient by extending time limits. Such extensions have been enacted in nearly all postwar U.S. recessions. The extensions would provide benefits to unemployed workers who might have trouble maintaining their pre-unemployment standard of living, implying that the extensions should stimulate consumption spending. The extensions, say to thirty-nine weeks, could be made for a defined period, such as a year. Even if the period exceeded a year, most of the budget dollars would be reversed as workers would naturally be better able to get jobs and would not be remaining on the unemployment rolls. This is one action that seems to satisfy all three conditions. Accelerate scheduled cuts in tax rates . If future tax-rate cuts are already enacted into law, putting them into effect sooner than planned could be done quickly. Presumably the relevant political compromises have already been made. As the acceleration would not damage the long-run budget position, the reversibility condition is satisfied. But that property could lessen the effect of the rate cuts. It has been found that consumers spend relatively little out of one-shot increases in their income. They spend much more when tax cuts are viewed as permanent rather than one-time events. Since rational, forward-looking consumers should view accelerated rate cuts as one-shot increases in income, the effect of these cuts on consumption could be limited. On the other hand, if consumers are not forward-looking but wait for their tax cuts before they begin spending, the accelerated rate cuts could stimulate a normal amount of consumer spending. In this case accelerated rate cuts could satisfy all three conditions. If one changed the tax policy expectations, the overall verdict is, if anything, less favorable. Suppose households did not expect proposed future rate cuts to become law. In such cases, moving up rate cuts might have a stronger perceived effect on permanent income and consumption and more clearly satisfy the impact test. But the same action might take the general budget out of long-term balance, at least as far as bond markets are concerned, and would fail the reversibility test. In this latter case, the accelerated tax cuts satisfy only two conditions. Temporary cuts in payroll taxes . One could also respond to recessions by cutting payroll taxes for a limited period. The cuts could be made quickly, satisfying the first requirement. But as with income taxes, if rates are cut only for a short time, the funds will appear to be temporary to consumers, in which case their effect on consumption may not be very large. Another problem with changing payroll taxes involves the fact that virtually all of them are now devoted to entitlement trust funds such as social security. The social security trust fund is already underfunded in a long-term actuarial sense, and payroll-tax revenues could not be removed from the fund, even for a short period, without raising the long-term actuarial deficit. Moreover, one would not want to start the tradition of using a long-term program to fund short-term needs--soon no long-term program would exist. Thus, if payroll taxes were to be cut, the fiscal flows would have to be kept separate from the social security system. Income taxes would need to be cut by an amount that workers would otherwise have paid into the fund as payroll taxes, without actually taking money from the fund itself. Such logistical complications could be difficult to work out and could lead to delays in enactment or implementation. Temporary cuts in sales taxes . A fast-acting, short-term measure with a powerful spending impact is a temporary cut in sales taxes. Whereas temporary income-tax cuts can be viewed as making a one-shot change in household disposable income, temporary sales-tax cuts bring about a temporary reduction in the prices of goods that consumers buy. The switch from a temporary income change to a temporary price change makes all the difference. The government is offering a sale on consumption goods and consumers should respond by raising consumption. The period of reduction should be kept reasonably short, to encourage households to take advantage of the favorable terms. It appears that this measure might satisfy all three tests. The only problem with temporary sales-tax cuts at the federal level is that the federal government does not impose any sales taxes. Most states do. Hence, for this measure to be effective, the federal government must give grants to those state governments that cut their sales taxes, roughly in the amount of the revenue lost to states from the cuts. Other arrangements might need to be made for the few states that do not impose sales taxes. Our supposedly quick program just got a bit more complicated, and one can easily imagine various states arguing about the revenue flows in the bill, holding up passage until the cyclical need has passed. Temporary inducements for investment . Following the same principles, the federal government, which does levy corporate taxes, could offer a sale on investment goods. Until 1986, the normal way of doing this was with a temporary investment credit. But the new tax laws make such a measure much more difficult. What can be done instead is to offer a temporary acceleration of depreciation allowances. As with temporary sales-tax reductions, making the period reasonably short could accelerate investment expenditures to the time when aggregate demand is weakest. A pro and a con are associated with focusing on investment instead of consumption. The advantageous feature is that investment represents capital deepening--the whole goal of keeping the long-run general government budget in balance is to encourage an investment-oriented economy. The con is that investment is already a more volatile spending component than consumption. If the temporary investment inducements are not timed to coincide with the cyclical dip in investment, they could exacerbate investment cycles and instability. But under some circumstances the investment inducements could pass all three tests. Conclusion The important point is to establish the right long-run policy framework, with general budget fiscal policy aimed at establishing budget balance on average over the cycle and entitlement trust fund policy aimed at making these programs actuarially sound over the long run. Monetary policy should be aimed at long-run price stability, with short-term flexibility in response to demand conditions. The fiscal measures and the monetary commitment to price stability stimulate investment, productivity, and technological change over the long term. The flexible monetary policy and the automatic fiscal stabilizers provide the economy with shock absorbers to smooth out business cycles. The unanswered question then involves the role of discretionary fiscal changes-- are they a valuable addition to this macroeconomic strategy? To be valuable, the measures should stimulate spending, take effect quickly, and be easily reversible. A number of temporary tax changes might do the job, but if they do not stimulate spending, their enactment is delayed, or if they are not easily reversible, they might do little more than to undermine the long-run fiscal strategy. The outcome ultimately depends on the details of the program, the speed of enactment, and the ease of reversibility.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced the issuance of a Prompt Corrective Action Directive against the New Century Bank, Shelby Township, Michigan. A copy of the Directive is attached.
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Conference of State Bank Supervisors Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Interagency Loan Data Request to Improve the Bank Examination Process The federal bank supervisory agencies and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors announced today an interagency effort to improve the efficiency of the examination process by standardizing the request for electronic loan information. This information is used primarily to conduct community and mid-size bank safety and soundness examinations and is currently provided in a variety of formats that can be time consuming and costly for regulators, banks and service providers to administer. The new standard provides improved data definitions and prescribes a standard format for the presentation of loan information. The new data format will improve the efficiency of the bank examination process and reduce the burden on banks, service providers, and vendors. Participation is voluntary, but the agencies encourage all institutions to participate when contacted as part of the pre-examination planning process. Examiners will begin asking for the new file in the second quarter of 2002. Today's initiative was a cooperative effort among the bank regulatory agencies and a number of service providers and software vendors. The agencies will host meetings in April to acquaint additional vendors with the new format.

Remarks by Governor Mark W. Olson At the Government Affairs Conference of America's Community Bankers, Washington, D.C. March 12, 2002 Current Industry Issues
Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Before the Independent Community Bankers of America, Honolulu, Hawaii (via satellite) March 13, 2002 The U.S. Economy I am pleased to appear once again before the Independent Community Bankers of America. There can be little doubt that the business environment in which you have operated over the past year has been challenging. Today I would like to review some of the principal forces likely to operate on the economy in coming months. But I would also like to focus on the emerging longer-term challenges, particularly on the need to augment our domestic saving rate to facilitate the financing of the investment that will almost surely be required as the baby boomers retire. As bankers, you will play a central part in meeting that challenge by channeling todayï¿½s saving into the capital that will be essential in providing for tomorrowï¿½s income. As I have noted in recent testimony, in the past several months, we have seen increasing signs that some of the forces restraining the economy over the past year are starting to diminish and that activity is beginning to firm. One key force in the economy is the movement of inventories. Stocks in many industries have been drawn down to levels at which firms will soon need to taper off their rate of liquidation, if they have not already done so. With production running well below sales, the lift to income and spending from the inevitable cessation of inventory liquidation could be significant. But that impetus to the growth of activity will be short-lived unless sustained increases in final demand kick in before the positive effects of the swing from inventory liquidation dissipate. In recent days, encouraging signs of strengthening underlying trends in final demand have emerged, although the dimensions of the pickup remain uncertain. Most recoveries in the post-World War II period received a boost from a rebound in demand for consumer durables and housing from recession-depressed levels as well as an abatement of inventory liquidation. Through much of last year's slowdown, however, spending by the household sector held up well and proved to be a major stabilizing force. As a consequence, although household spending should continue to trend up, the potential for significant acceleration in activity in this sector is likely to be more limited than in past cycles. Perhaps most central to the outlook for consumer spending will be developments in the labor market. The pace of layoffs quickened last fall, especially after September 11 and the unemployment rate rose sharply. However, layoffs diminished noticeably in January, and employment turned up last month. Moreover, initial claims for unemployment insurance have decreased markedly, on balance, providing further evidence of an improvement in labor market conditions. The dynamics of inventory investment and the balance of factors influencing consumer demand will have important consequences for the economic outlook in coming months. But the broad contours of the present cycle have been, and will continue to be, driven by the evolution of corporate profits and capital investment. The retrenchment in capital spending over the past year and a half was central to the sharp slowing we experienced in overall activity. On balance, the recovery in spending on business fixed investment is likely to be only gradual; in particular, its growth will doubtless be less frenetic than in 1999 and early 2000--a period during which outlays were boosted by the dislocations of Y2K and the extraordinarily low cost of equity capital available to many firms. Nonetheless, if the recent more-favorable economic developments gather momentum, uncertainties will diminish, risk premiums will fall, and the pace of capital investment embodying new technologies will increase. Even a subdued recovery would constitute a truly remarkable performance for the American economy in the face of so severe a decline in equity asset values and an unprecedented blow from terrorists to the foundations of our market systems. For if the tentative indications that the contraction phase of this business cycle has drawn to a close are ultimately confirmed, we will have experienced a significantly milder downturn than the long history of business cycles would have led us to expect. Although there are ample reasons to be cautious about the economic outlook, the recuperative powers of the U.S. economy in the recent past have been encouraging. One important ingredient in that resilience has been the performance of productivity. Even discounting somewhat the phenomenal strength of the growth of output per hour of late, one cannot help but be impressed with how well productivity has held up in the face of the abrupt slowing of the economy in late 2000 and in 2001. That performance has been encouraging because the nationï¿½s fortunes, to a very great degree, will depend on the evolution of the growth of productivity. In particular, productivity will play a central role in determining the nature of the economyï¿½s response to the aging of the population soon upon us. Most economic forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty. At least by comparison, one judgment looks to be a reasonably sure proposition: The ratio of retirees to those still working will rise precipitously starting at the end of this decade and will continue to climb through the first third of this century and remain high thereafter. In part, this projected development owes to the retirement of the baby boomers. But the phenomenon is broader than that and reflects the aging of our society. Importantly, according to the social security trustees, the demographic challenge will not go away with the passing of the baby-boom generation. This ever-larger retired population will have to be fed, clothed, housed, and serviced by a workforce growing far less rapidly. The retirees may have accumulated a large stock of retirement savings, but the goods and services needed to redeem those savings must be produced by an active workforce assisted by a stock of plant and equipment sufficiently productive to meet the needs both of retirees and of a workforce expecting an ever-increasing standard of living. Though from an individual householdï¿½s point of view, saving reflects financial claims adequate to meet future needs, the focus for the economy as a whole, of necessity, must be on producing the real resources needed to redeem the financial assets. The role of finance is to channel saving into investment in the physical capital assets that assist in the production of the gross domestic product, which, in turn, serves both retirees and active workers. Clearly, an efficient system of finance can more effectively deploy a given stock of capital and thus maximize its contribution to supporting the population. Any analysis of the amount and type of saving required to finance the bulge in retirements that is just over the horizon clearly needs to project (1) the number of retirees, (2) the size of our workforce, and (3) the productivity of that workforce. Of the three, productivity is most directly affected by the level of investment, which, of course, is financed by saving. The size of the future workforce, excluding immigrants, and the size of the future retired population are relatively simple to project from today's age distribution. The level of immigration, both legal and illegal, will be dominated by public policy decisions and by economic forces, both in the United States and in the countries from which our immigrants are drawn. This forecast is more problematic, and its level matters: Over the past decade, for example, immigration accounted for approximately one-third of the increase in our workforce. The larger our workforce in 2010 and beyond, the easier producing goods and services for both retirees and active workers will be. Immigration policy will, therefore, be a key component of baby-boom retirement policy. The rate of saving--for retirement and other purposes--may not directly affect either the number of retirees or the size of the workforce. But it surely affects capital investment, which it finances, and the productivity that it engenders. Besides the total amount of saving and investment, changes in the allocation of those funds among different types of capital also appear to influence the growth of labor productivity. A dollar of new saving flows through financial markets to firms that allocate it among different types of capital investment. Clearly, firms' choices about the types of investments to make matter crucially for how much labor productivity ultimately is boosted. In the late 1990s, for example, businesses allocated much more of their investment dollars toward high-tech, higher-return capital than they did in earlier years. Businesses made this shift and are continuing to move further in that direction in response to the extremely rapid decline in the prices of high-tech assets and the new opportunities that these assets have afforded. According to one set of calculations, of the roughly 2-1/2 percent annual rate of increase in output per hour, or labor productivity, between 1995 and 2001, perhaps a quarter of that growth could be attributed to on-going shifts in the composition, as distinct from the dollar level, of capital. Improvements in the quantity and quality of our workforceï¿½s education enhance workers' skills and contribute importantly to the growth of labor productivity. But far more important over the past six years have been the gains in output attributable to technological innovation, especially information technology and improved managerial organization, and, as I noted in testimony last week, the greater flexibility and resilience of our economy stemming from deregulation, primarily in finance. Notwithstanding these more-intangible contributions, the level of saving remains a key ingredient of economic growth. But we need also to know whether the source of that saving is sustainable and, beyond that, whether the type of financial assets in which our saving overall is accumulated affects our productivity. During the past six years, about 40 percent of the total increase in our capital stock in effect has been financed, on net, by saving from abroad. This situation is reflected in our ongoing current account deficit, which, by definition, is a measure of our net investment in domestic plant and equipment financed with foreign funds, both debt and equity. But this deficit is also a measure of the increase in the level of net claims, primarily debt claims, that foreigners have on our assets. As the stock of such claims grows, an ever-larger flow of interest payments must be provided to the foreign suppliers of this capital. Countries that have gone down this path invariably have run into trouble, and so would we. Eventually, the current account deficit will have to be restrained. The nation's economic potential will be brighter if that comes about through an increase in domestic saving rather than a reduction in domestic investment. A more contentious issue is whether the mix of domestic private and government saving affects the rate of productivity growth. Another is whether the form of private saving--for example in stocks or debt instruments including bank deposits--affects productivity growth. Ultimately, the composition of real investment in our economy will reflect, among other influences, the attitudes toward risk of those who own the financial claims against the capital stock. The nationï¿½s savers, daily in the marketplace, exhibit an obvious sensitivity to the association between expected return and risk. Few, if any, individuals would be willing to accept greater risk without the potential for greater reward. Similarly, a nation as a whole would not be willing to invest in riskier assets without a commensurately greater overall economic growth potential. That same tradeoff is reflected in the willingness of many investors to forgo the higher rates of return on equity for the greater tranquility of the lesser stress and risk associated with most debt instruments. Reflecting that differential in risk, returns on common stocks over rolling twenty-year periods have almost always outpaced the returns on less-risky securities. Should relative preferences of savers in the aggregate shift toward debt instruments and away from equity, interest rates will be driven lower and equity-price ratios higher. These shifts in asset valuation will induce business enterprises to alter their choice of capital projects. Specifically, firms will find that only projects with lower average rates of return will meet the requirement of providing the more certain, more stable income stream desired by savers. The physical counterpart to this choice by businesses of projects with lower expected financial returns is a slower growth of productivity, on average, across the economy. Conversely, if savers become more risk-tolerant, financial risk premiums will decline. In response to these reduced penalties on risk, firms will be induced to adjust the mix of their endeavors toward more-speculative projects--but, importantly, presumably ones that also offer higher prospective rates of return on average, which more often than not, translate into higher long-term average economic growth. Thus, the answer to whether government or private saving does more to foster productivity growth arguably comes down to the propensity of U.S. savers to take risks. Government saving is reflected largely in a retirement of debt. Having chosen to hold at least a portion of their savings in riskless securities, holders of government debt when confronted with debt retirement presumably would chose less-risky private debt securities over common stocks to rebalance their portfolios. Thus an increased share of saving from the government is a markedly more conservative financial strategy than if the saving were undertaken in the private sector. Obviously, the federal government could invest in higher-risk assets, such as equities. But for reasons that I have expressed many times, I do not believe that, other than in defined-contribution plans, such investment can be accomplished free of political pressures that would distort the efficient use of capital. Presumably, most of those who maintain that greater risk-taking would likely produce faster long-term growth would acknowledge that increased competition and economic growth would also bring greater volatility and social stress. Because of the near certainty of a major rise in the retiree-to-worker ratio in the next few decades, we now face the pressing need to set policies for the enhanced productivity growth that will be necessary if we are to successfully meet the pending demographic challenge. How much personal stress--and, some argue, increased inequality, which may be a byproduct of a highly competitive, high-octane economy--have we as a nation chosen? Is the amount compatible with the level of domestic saving and possibly the risk-taking that is consonant with the elevated level of productivity growth necessary to meet the needs of an aging population? A national consensus on these questions is clearly missing. This is doubtless an area for useful debate. Regardless of the outcome of that debate, there can be little disagreement that an efficient banking system and sound financial markets will be critical in directing our scarce national saving into the productive investments that will provide the wherewithal to meet our future needs. Each of you can contribute to a process that will lift the standards of living enjoyed by our fellow citizens.
Testimony of Mark W. Olson The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2002 Before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives March 14, 2002 Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2002. This is my first appearance before this subcommittee since becoming a member of the Board of Governors. In my previous careers, I have been a banker, an industry representative, and a consultant as well as a congressional staff member, so I can appreciate the importance to the banking industry, supervisors and consumers of legislation that balances burden reduction with effective supervision and good public policy. I also understand that drafting that type of legislation is no easy task. The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2002 should further improve efficiency and ultimately benefit the consumer. This past summer, Chairman Oxley asked the banking agencies for suggestions for ways to improve the banking laws and relieve unnecessary burden. The Federal Reserve made several suggestions that have been included in the bill. Let me start by indicating that we are happy to continue to work with the subcommittee and the full committee and their staffs to improve these provisions and the bill. De Novo Interstate Branching Our first suggestion--a recommendation joined in by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency--involves removal of barriers to de novo interstate branching. Since enactment of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, all fifty states have permitted interstate expansion through bank mergers. As a result, interstate branching is a reality. And it is a reality with good results: commercial banks currently operate more than 65,000 branches in the United States, an amount that far exceeds the 51,000 branches operated by banks in 1990. More than 2,500 branches were opened by banks in 2000 alone. The creation of new branches helps maintain the competitiveness and dynamism of the American banking industry and improve access to banking services in otherwise under-served markets. Branch entry into new markets leads to less concentrated local banking markets, which, in turn, results in better banking services for households and small businesses, lower interest rates on loans and higher deposit interest rates. As customers become more mobile and live, work and operate across state borders, they also benefit from allowing banks to operate branches across state lines. However, the Riegle-Neal Act permitted interstate branching through the establishment of new offices without an acquisition only if the host state enacted legislation that expressly permits entry by de novo branching (an "opt in" requirement). To date, seventeen states have enacted some form of opt-in legislation, and thirty-three states and the District of Columbia continue to require interstate entry through the acquisition of an existing bank. This limitation on de novo branching is an obstacle to interstate entry for all banks, and, in particular, is a costly and burdensome route for small banks to follow. Moreover, it creates an unlevel playing field between banks and federal savings associations, which have long been allowed to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis. The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2002 would remove this last obstacle to interstate branching for all banks and level the playing field between banks and thrifts by allowing banks to establish interstate branches on a de novo basis. The bill also would remove the parallel provision that allows states to impose a minimum requirement on the age of banks that are acquired by out-of-state banking organizations. These changes would allow banks, including in particular small banks near state borders, to better serve their customers by establishing new interstate branches and acquiring newly chartered banks across state lines. It would also increase competition by providing banks a less costly method for offering their services at new locations. These new interstate branches would continue to be subject to the regulatory provisions that were established by the Riegle-Neal Act for interstate branches, and could only be established if the opening bank meets the financial, managerial, Community Reinvestment Act and other requirements for establishing a de novo branch. While we support the provisions expanding the de novo branching authority for full-service banks, we call the committee's attention to an important issue that these provisions raise. Industrial loan companies (ILCs) and nonbank banks operate under special exemptions that allow them to be owned by commercial companies without the activities restrictions and supervision that applies generally to bank holding companies. When these statutory exceptions were originally granted, ILCs and nonbank banks were limited in both number and the types of activities that they were permitted to conduct. However, over time these loopholes have been expanded significantly to the point that ILCs and nonbank banks have virtually all of the powers of commercial banks, and the ILC charter in particular has become available to any commercial company. Deposits in these institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. However, the ownership requirements and regulatory oversight of these owners fall outside of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act). They operate, therefore, in a less constrained regulatory environment than do banks and thrift institutions. We are concerned that, should ILCs and nonbank banks be permitted the new branching authority, an unintended consequence of this action would be to create FDIC-insured depository institutions with the capacity to operate nationwide without federal supervision of the parent organization or restriction on their affiliations. This lack of consolidated supervision and regulation raises supervisory and safety and soundness issues because owners and affiliates of these insured institutions are allowed to take risks and conduct operations that may have a material effect on the insured institutions. In addition, granting expanded branching powers to these institutions would place commercial banks and their holding companies at a significant competitive disadvantage and would be a major expansion of the loopholes in which these companies are permitted to operate. For these reasons, we strongly urge this committee to exclude ILCs and nonbank banks from this proposed branching opportunity. Reduction of Cross-Marketing Restrictions An important provision of the bill amends the cross-marketing restrictions imposed by the GLB Act on the merchant banking investments of financial holding companies. Currently, a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company and a nonfinancial company that is held under the GLB Act merchant banking authority by the same financial holding company are prohibited from engaging in cross-marketing activities. The primary purpose of this cross-marketing restriction is to preclude an unintended breach of the separation of banking and commerce retained in the GLB Act. The GLB Act, however, already permits a depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities through statement stuffers and Internet websites with nonfinancial companies held by an insurance underwriting affiliate under the parallel insurance company investment authority granted by the GLB Act. These cross-marketing activities are permitted only if they are conducted in accordance with the anti-tying restrictions of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 and the Board determines that the proposed arrangement is in the public interest, does not undermine the separation of banking and commerce, and is consistent with the safety and soundness of depository institutions. The bill would allow depository institutions controlled by a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with companies held under the merchant banking authority to the same extent, and subject to the same restrictions, as companies held under the insurance company investment authority. We believe that this parity of treatment is appropriate and see no reason to treat the merchant banking and insurance investments of financial holding companies differently for purposes of the cross-marketing restrictions of the GLB Act. The bill also is intended to permit a depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with a nonfinancial company held under the merchant banking authority if the nonfinancial company is not controlled by the financial holding company. We agree that, when a financial holding company does not control a portfolio company, cross-marketing activities are unlikely to materially undermine the separation between the nonfinancial portfolio company on the one hand and the financial holding company and its depository institution subsidiaries on the other hand. In these noncontrol situations, the separation of banking and commerce is maintained by the other restrictions contained in the GLB Act that limit the holding period of the investment as well as the authority of the financial holding company to routinely manage and operate the portfolio company. We have offered some technical assistance on this provision of the bill and, with these changes, we support both cross-marketing provisions. Removal of the Post-Approval Waiting Period for Bank Acquisitions and Mergers Currently, banks and bank holding companies are required by statute to delay consummation of a proposal to merge with or acquire another bank or bank holding company for thirty days beyond the date that the transaction has been approved by the appropriate federal banking agency. This statutory delay is designed to allow the U.S. Attorney General an opportunity to initiate legal action in cases that the Attorney General believes will have a significantly adverse effect on competition. The Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act allow this post-approval waiting period to be shortened to fifteen days if the relevant federal banking agency and the U.S. Attorney General concur. However, those acts do not permit the agencies to shorten the period to less than fifteen days, even in cases in which the relevant federal banking agency and the Attorney General agree that the transaction will have no adverse effect on competition. The regulatory relief bill includes a proposed amendment that would remove this statutory minimum waiting period in cases in which the appropriate federal banking agency and the Attorney General agree that the proposal would not result in significantly adverse effects on competition in any relevant market. This revision would allow transactions that have been approved by the relevant agencies to be consummated immediately upon approval, without the costly and unnecessary delay that is currently imposed by statute. Under the amendment, unless the Attorney General agreed to a shorter period, a mandatory thirty-day waiting period would continue to be imposed (other than in cases involving a bank failure or an emergency, for which the statutes already set different periods). Eliminate Certain Unnecessary Reports Another provision in the bill would eliminate certain reporting requirements that currently are imposed by statute on banks and their executive officers and principal shareholders. In particular, the bill repeals three reporting provisions. The first requires any executive officer of a bank to file a report with the bank's board of directors whenever the executive officer obtains a loan from another bank in an amount that exceeds the amount the executive officer could obtain from his or her own bank. The second provision requires a bank to file a separate report with its quarterly call report regarding any loans the bank has made to its executive officers since its previous call report. The third reporting provision requires the executive officers and principal shareholders of a bank to file an annual report with the bank's board of directors if the officer or shareholder has any loan outstanding from a correspondent bank of the bank. This provision also authorizes the federal banking agencies to issue rules requiring a bank to disclose publicly information received from an executive officer or principal shareholder concerning his or her loans from a correspondent bank. These reports have limited usefulness and the Board has not found them to contribute significantly to the effective monitoring of insider lending or the prevention of insider abuse. In our supervisory experience, the costs of preparing and collecting these reports are not outweighed by their benefits. Importantly, elimination of these reporting requirements would not alter the statutory restrictions on loans by banks to their executive officers and principal shareholders, or limit the authority of the federal banking agencies to take enforcement action against a bank or its insiders for violation of these statutory lending limits. Moreover, each federal banking agency would retain authority under other provisions of law to collect information regarding insider lending. In addition, the existing record-keeping requirements in the Board's Regulation O should help to ensure that bank supervisors have access to sufficient information for determining compliance with the federal laws that restrict bank lending to insiders, and examiners would continue to be able to review these records during the examination process to verify compliance with these laws. Update Exception Allowing Interlocks with Small Depository Institutions The bill would also update an exception already granted by statute under the Depository Institutions Management Interlocks Act. That act generally prohibits depository organizations that are not affiliated with each other from having management officials in common if the organizations are located or have a depository institution affiliate located in the same metropolitan statistical area (MSA), primary metropolitan statistical area, or consolidated metropolitan statistical area. The Act provides some modest leeway for interlocks with a depository institution that has less than $20 million in assets. This exception for small institutions was established in 1978 and the asset limit has not been increased since that time. The bill would increase this exception to cover organizations with less than $100 million in assets that are located in an MSA. This change would allow smaller organizations increased access to management expertise and would conform the dollar limits for director interlocks with the exception already provided by statute for advisory and honorary director interlocks. Permit Exceptions to Attribution Rule The bill also contains a provision that we believe will help banking organizations maintain attractive benefits programs for their employees. A bank holding company is generally prohibited from owning, in the aggregate, more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any company. The Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act) also provides that, for purposes of determining the amount of shares owned or controlled by a bank holding company, any shares held by a trust for the benefit of the company or its shareholders, members or employees are deemed to be controlled by the holding company. This attribution provision was intended to prevent a bank holding company from evading the BHC Act's restrictions on the acquisition of shares of banks and nonbanking companies through the use of a trust established for the benefit of the management, shareholders or employees of the company. This attribution provision, while generally a useful tool to prevent evasion of the BHC Act, does not always provide an appropriate result. For example, it may not be appropriate to apply the attribution rule when shares are acquired by a retirement trust, 401(k) plan or profit-sharing plan that operates for the benefit of employees of the bank holding company. In these situations, the bank holding company may not have the ability to influence the purchase or sale decisions of the employees or otherwise control shares that are held in trust for its employees. The bill would allow the Board to address these situations by authorizing the Board to grant exceptions from the attribution rule where appropriate. Conclusion The bill has quite a few other provisions, many suggested by my colleagues at the other federal banking agencies, that you will hear about this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to speak about provisions suggested by the Board and look forward to working with the subcommittee on this and other useful legislation.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the publication of a guide to help consumers better understand their rights and responsibilities with regard to electronic check conversion transactions. The guide, "When is Your Check Not a Check? Electronic Check Conversion," discusses what electronic check conversion is, how consumers can tell if their check will be electronically converted, some of the differences between a regular check transaction and electronic check conversion, consumers' rights in an electronic check conversion transaction, and what consumers can do if they have problems with such transactions. In an electronic check conversion transaction, a consumer authorizes the use of a check to obtain information for initiating an electronic debit from the consumer's account. "When Is Your Check Not a Check?" covers electronic check conversion at the point of sale as well as when the consumer has mailed a check to a company that uses electronic check conversion. The guide also provides a checklist for consumers to use before and after an electronic check conversion transaction, and items to review when they receive their account statements from financial institutions. Print copies of the guide are available from Publications Services, Mail Stop 127, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551. The first 100 copies are free. The guide is also available on the Board's web site at . A PDF (Portable Document Format) version is provided on the web site so that consumer groups, financial institutions, and retailers can download and print copies for distribution to their clients and customers. It includes a space on the back panel for organizations to provide their own contact information.
Remarks by Governor Susan S. Bies At the Ohio Bankers Day Conference, Ohio Department of Commerce, Columbus, Ohio March 21, 2002 Current Challenges of Community Banks Good morning. I am delighted to be here to discuss a variety of issues that I believe are relevant today to directors and senior managers of banks. During my brief term on the Board, I have heard other governors say that they came to Washington expecting to spend most of their time discussing the economy and monetary policy with many of the Board's 225 PhD. economists and then making policy decisions and judgments. Although those activities are, in fact, an important part of the job, my colleagues have typically found that they spend significantly more time on bank supervisory and regulatory matters. I suspect that will be my experience as well, and--as a former banker--I look forward to dealing with these issues from the other side of the table. As I do so, I'm sure I will benefit greatly from opportunities like this one to meet with industry participants. In my comments today, I will address three topics: the financial performance of U.S. banks, in particular, of community banks; the improvements that banks large and small are making in measuring and managing risk; and finally, the responsibilities of directors and senior managers in corporate governance. In my view, these topics are integrally linked and, in light of current questions of confidence in America's corporations, quite timely. Financial Condition of U.S. Banks Last year was exceptional in many respects, with the United States slipping into what appears to have been a mild recession, and with the terrorist attacks in September. In response, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates at every meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2001 and an additional three times between meetings, for a total of eleven rate cuts totaling 475 basis points. Also, by year-end, serious concerns had arisen about the integrity of corporate management and financial reporting. Credit quality deterioration was concentrated in larger corporations, with several filing for bankruptcy. Argentina's economic difficulties reminded us, yet again, that exposures to emerging economies could present substantial risk. Given these events, the U.S. banking system has remained strong possibly in large part, because the recession in this country seems to have been relatively mild and short-lived. More directly, the strength seems also to reflect improvements in risk management at many banks and a greater awareness throughout the industry that institutions should promptly address problems as they emerge. This time, both the banking industry and the regulatory agencies appear to have done just that--acted promptly--and without going too far and unnecessarily constraining credit. Much of the weakness among banks recently has been concentrated in large regional and money center banks, rather than in smaller institutions. Bank earnings, capital levels, and asset quality all remain strong by historical standards. Indeed, as the industry's problem assets began to climb in recent years, banks were generally better prepared to deal with potential threats than they were in the past. The industry entered the latest slowdown in solid financial condition, giving both the banking system and the regulatory agencies much more freedom to respond than they had a decade ago when losses were large and broadly based and bank capital positions were weak. To be sure, there were signs that risks in recent years were building, to the point that both the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued warnings about lending standards as early as 1998, a time when many of today's weak credits were booked. Financial problems in Asia later that year further sensitized large banks, in particular, to potential risks and led many to strengthen their lending standards and practices. That proverbial "stitch in time" may have helped greatly in preventing problems from becoming larger. Nevertheless, for each of the past two years, the annual interagency reviews of shared national credits have shown clear deterioration in bank asset quality. Both times, the reviews of credits exceeding $20 million that are shared by three or more banking organizations indicated not only that problem assets were rising quickly but also that the lead underwriters were sometimes slow to recognize the deterioration in their internal credit ratings. Both of these findings were particularly apparent to us in 2000, but promptness in recognition of deteriorating credit ratings improved notably in 2001, when the supervisory reviews produced far fewer surprises to banks. When the economy slows, one expects the volume of problem credit to rise. The key, of course, is to anticipate such slowdowns and to maintain sound credit standards at all times. As a former banker, I know that is easier said than done, given the uncertainties of credit and economic analysis and the level of competition. That's where sound risk- management processes and procedures, diversification, corporate governance, and strong capital ratios play important roles. For the most part, community banks have so far been spared from the weakness in commercial and industrial loan portfolios that has affected many larger institutions. Though all banks were affected by the soft economy last year, those with less than $1 billion in assets saw little increase in their nonperforming C&I loans, compared with a rise of 37 percent for the industry overall. As a result, community banks generally avoided pressures to increase loss provisions and still maintained reserve coverage ratios that were stronger than those of larger banks. In short, smaller banks here in Ohio and across the country have weathered recent periods quite well and are advantageously situated to do their part in supporting economic growth. If not C&I lending, what areas may present heightened risks to community banks today? First, for most of the past decade, community banks--particularly those in the asset range of $100 million to $1 billion--have actively expanded their commercial real estate lending. Since the early 1990s, larger community banks have grown commercial real estate portfolios from 13 percent to 22 percent of aggregate assets. To date, these credits have generally performed well, and my comments are not intended to suggest a material concern. These credits, however, account for most of the group's increase in nonperforming assets last year. Given the checkered history of commercial real estate lending and its increased relevance to many community banks, this portfolio must be monitored and managed carefully. We have often seen the cyclical nature of commercial real estate and its links to the general level of economic activity. The loss of anchor firms such as K-Mart, for example, may reduce the market value of certain shopping centers and the consumer traffic and the financial strength of nearby businesses as well. The second area of potential risk relates to interest rates. For the industry overall, the Federal Reserve's rate cuts last year may have proved to be a mixed blessing. Lower interest rates undoubtedly eased payment pressures on many borrowers and prevented further deterioration in the quality of bank loan portfolios. Liability-sensitive banks saw their funding costs fall faster than loan and investment yields, widening their net interest margin. Lower interest rates also spurred a record volume of mortgage refinancings and sizable gains in bank securities portfolios. However, the lower rates will begin to narrow net interest margins for some institutions. Rates paid on deposits are close to their effective floors, and yields on loan portfolios are lower because of refinancings and the falling prime rate. Many banks responded to the low rates by sharply reducing their investments in Treasuries and shifting funds into mortgage-backed securities, as they searched for higher yields. Given the historically low interest rates at which recent mortgages have been originated or refinanced, one might expect that these loans would be much slower to prepay than previous ones. As a result, the effective maturity, or duration, of bank securities portfolios--and of many loan portfolios, as well--has been extended. Clearly, I am not about to forecast interest rates, something I've already learned that central bankers never do. Nevertheless, the interest-rate environment could present banks with a greater challenge this year. In this situation, the simple concept of "reversion to the mean" suggests a greater awareness of the risk of rising rates and their effect on long-term assets. Even stable rates could present increased risks, if savings and money market deposit accounts deposits flow out of banks as quickly as they came in last year. We should all ask ourselves how long depositors would be content earning the currently low rates as equity markets improve or interest rates rise once again. At some point, even loyal customers-- those on fixed incomes, in particular--may blink and take steps to improve their returns. Turning to the longer-term outlook, what are the prospects for community banks? The picture is mixed. Clearly community banks have performed and continue to perform well, and they will retain an important role in our banking system. They have historically had higher profitability, as measured by the return on average assets, than large regional and money center banks and, on an individual-institution basis, have enjoyed relatively strong asset and deposit growth. A study recently published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin examined growth rates during the past fifteen years for large and small banks. Adjusting the data for mergers and acquisitions, the authors found that small and medium-sized banks--defined as those below the 100 largest--grew faster than the larger banks in virtually every year between 1985 and 2000. Moreover, the smallest banks, those below the 1,000 largest in terms of assets, grew the fastest of all in both deposits and total assets. The banks did this the old-fashioned way, by earning more on assets than larger institutions. Although small banks paid higher average deposit rates than the large banks paid, their net interest margins were still much higher, and by a growing differential in recent years. Measured by return on assets, small banks have done as well as or better than large banks in all but a handful of years over the past decade and a half. Among small banks, those located in urban areas have done best, presumably because economic activity has been expanding the fastest in cities. Asset and deposit growth at small agricultural banks, by contrast, lagged behind that at other small banks, although not at large banks. The comparatively poor performance of agricultural banks seems to reflect the level of credit demand in the agricultural sector itself, as growth of farm business debt has lagged behind that of total nonfinancial debt. Another factor has been a pickup in market share by the Farm Credit System. Even so, when measured by return on assets, small agricultural banks have performed on a par with other small banks. The surprisingly strong and persistent growth in the number of branch offices also suggests that the personal touch, which plays to the strength of community banks, remains an important element of banking in the age of the Internet. During the past fifteen years, the number of branch offices has steadily increased, rising more than 50 percent, from about 43,000 to more than 65,000 branches. The creation of de novo banks also remains strong, rising in recent years to about 200, annually, from roughly 100 new banks each year during 1993-95. Regardless of how long these trends continue, the creation of so many new banks and banking offices suggests that the market still views the opportunities and business franchise of small commercial banks to be quite sound. On the other hand, trends in market share for community banks seem to present a less optimistic picture. Adjusting the data to account for inflation and real industry growth, the community bank share of industry assets has steadily declined, falling from 25 percent a decade ago to about 16 percent now. By other measures of industry structure, the number of banks, top-tier holding companies, and independent banks all declined sharply during the past ten to fifteen years. If small banks are doing so well, what explains their steady decline in market share and number? Apparently, the industry's massive consolidation has simply allowed many owners of small banks--as well as not-so-small banks--to liquidate their investments at nice profits. For now, the future of community banks remains bright. These banks are performing well, and those that remain independent are likely to thrive in the years ahead. A crucial question, though, is how large the community-banking group will be a decade from now and how much additional industry consolidation lies ahead. Although the banks that survive may do well, the number of community banks may continue to decline significantly. Managing Risks For the moment, another dynamic that may be working for community banks is their relatively simple--and more readily transparent--operations. Certainly complex, off-balance- sheet transactions and the accounting standards associated with them have appropriately attracted much attention in recent months. This increased complexity has become a particular challenge for bank supervisors as well. In the current, post-Enron environment, financial institutions, their accountants, and regulators must understand each other's role and the need for adequate transparency in reporting to investors and customers. You may recall that in the wake of the thrift industry problems of the 1980s legislation required the banking agencies to apply generally accepted accounting principles in their regulatory reports, rather than special accounting rules established by depository institution regulators. At the time, the Congress saw the requirement as helpful in strengthening regulatory standards and reporting requirements. As new types of transactions have developed, and organizations of all types have become more complex, concerns have been raised about the robustness of accounting standards. For various reasons, accounting and disclosure practices have tended to obfuscate more than clarify and to conceal rather than disclose. That situation must change. One of the challenges facing management and auditors is to fairly disclose the information that is most important to investors and customers in assessing the health of any organization they deal with. This necessarily includes sufficient information to understand the key risk exposures that the organization must manage successfully. Of course, before any risk can be disclosed it must first be identified and characterized in some fashion. Increasingly, this characterization and the entire risk- management process have become more quantitative, reflecting not only the enhanced ability and lower costs of collecting and processing data but also improved techniques for measuring and managing risk. Larger banking organizations quantify a borrower's probability of default, the bank's loss given default and its likely exposure at the time of default--practices upon which we are trying to construct new international capital standards. At community banks, the greater use of credit-scoring has, it seems, improved risk management as well. Such tools should perform even better after the effects of the most recent economic slowdown are incorporated. Consumer credit models were developed after the 1990-91 recession, and so their reliability in predicting credit quality in the current slowdown is yet to be determined. Further, we are already observing increases in delinquencies in subprime lending. Since many of these borrowers did not have significant access to credit in previous recessions, their ultimate default rate will also help to validate the strength of the new statistical models. Community banks have greatly improved their management of interest rate risk in recent years. Information developed from models that are used to identify sensitivity to market changes in the mix of loans and deposits are now part of asset/liability committee meetings at community banks. As a result, managers can better anticipate changes in net interest income and respond appropriately to their unique competitive conditions. Community bankers are also developing new revenue streams that will help to manage risk by diversifying sources of earnings. In addition, the fee income streams help to increase the cross-sell ratio with key customers. This in turn should improve customer loyalty, another factor that should help manage risk by stabilizing revenue. Providing the personal touch has served community banks well, but conducting sound market research and pricing to reflect competition, customer value, and risk are becoming more important for success. Corporate Governance As bankers and bank directors, you have specific responsibilities to manage and control your risks well. Not only are the activities of banks central to credit intermediation, in this country banks fund those activities in part with federally insured deposits. These deposits are the lowest cost source of funds for bankers because of the government's guarantee. Bankers also have obligations to investors and customers to clearly disclose the condition of their organizations and effectively oversee the system of internal controls. Bank directors are not expected to understand every nuance of banking or to oversee each transaction. They can look to management for that. They do, however, have the responsibility to set the tone regarding their institutions' risk-taking and to implement sufficient controls so that they can reasonably expect that their directives will be met. They also have the responsibility to hire individuals who they believe have integrity and can exercise a high level of judgment and competence. All the banking agencies have issued guidance describing the proper roles of bank officers and directors that address such matters as policies, procedures, information systems, and controls. For example, interagency policy holds boards of directors responsible for ensuring that their organizations have an effective audit process and internal controls that are adequate for the nature and scope of the business. The reporting lines of the internal audit function should be such that the information directors receive is impartial and not unduly influenced by management. Internal audit is a key element of management's responsibility to validate the strength of their internal controls. If internal audit is outsourced, the best practice is to not use the same firm for the external audit engagement. Indeed, the recent failure of Oakwood Deposit Bank Company, an Ohio institution, appears to underscore the importance of the audit function and sound internal controls in guarding a bank against harm. Audit committee members should have regular time in meetings to talk with the outside auditors without managers present. Best practices for audit committee processes have been laid out many times, including in the 1980s by the Treadway Commission and in 2000 by the Blue Ribbon Committee. Beyond that, boards of directors and managers should periodically test where they stand on ethical business practices. For example, ask whether we squeaked by on technicalities and on the margin, adhering perhaps to the letter but not the spirit of the "law"? Are we compensating others and ourselves based on the value of our contributions to the organization, or are we taking advantage of opportunities and abusing our positions? My intent today is to remind everyone of the importance of maintaining sound ethical practices to help protect the reputation of your bank. As recent events have demonstrated, if we fail to do so, the market will enforce the discipline. And that discipline can be harsh and sometimes indiscriminate. Investors and customers tend to vote quickly with their feet, once confidence is lost. Conclusion In closing, I commend you and the industry, generally, for the success of the 1990s and for dealing effectively with a challenging year in 2001. The industry has demonstrated that it is fundamentally sound and well positioned. Bankers should support the development of risk-management processes for those types of risk that are most relevant for their particular institution. Though the quality of bank accounting and control systems is strong, bankers should heed lessons to be learned from Enron. Strengthen corporate governance where needed to prevent such abusive practices from occurring at your institutions. As bankers and bank regulators, we are responsible for conducting our affairs with competence and integrity. Let's take the opportunity times like this present and make our banking system even stronger.
Remarks by Governor Mark W. Olson At the School of Business and Industry, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida March 26, 2002 Career Development in a Changing Economy I am delighted that my long-time friend, Ron Tate, invited me to participate in the Forum Series of the School of Business and Industry at Florida A&M University. In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on the economy and on the business environment that many of you will soon enter. In doing so, I will be drawing on my experience most recently as an economic policymaker and, before that, in business and banking. The views I will be expressing are my own and are not necessarily shared by other members of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. First, I will touch briefly on the current economic situation and on why, despite the weak pace of economic activity in 2001, I see the longer-run outlook for the U.S. economy as quite favorable. Then I would like to discuss the evolution of the labor market over the past few decades and its implications for someone about to embark on a career. In doing so, I will attempt to identify the challenges that changes in the work environment pose for new entrants to the workforce, and will offer my perspectives on how you might best meet those challenges. As you undoubtedly know, the National Bureau of Economic Research has determined that the U.S. economy entered a recession about one year ago, a downturn that ended an unprecedented period of economic expansion. That remarkable expansion was notable not only for its duration but also for its rapid advances in technology, which fueled a surge in business capital spending, an acceleration in productivity, and rapid gains in real income and wealth. However, when demand began to slow in late 2000, businesses were faced with uncomfortably high levels of inventories, an oversupply of capital goods, and declining profits. As a result, businesses made the usual adjustments to these conditions. They cut production, slashed inventories, reduced capital spending, and laid off workers. That adjustment process was subsequently exacerbated by the events of September 11. I am sure that all of you remember the uncertainty and shock of the period immediately after September 11, when our economy came briefly to a near standstill. Surprisingly, in light of that experience, the latest recession has turned out to be quite mild by the standards of the past thirty years. Current estimates indicate that real GDP was about flat during the last three quarters of 2001, in contrast with the average decline of 2-1/2 percent posted in the deeper recessions of 1973-75, 1981-82, and 1990-91. The better performance this time around has come in large part from the solid pace of household spending over the past year. Buoyed by low interest rates, falling energy prices, and tax cuts, home sales last year remained near a record high, motor vehicle sales peaked at their highest level ever, and overall real personal consumption expenditures increased about 3 percent, a rate well below the pace of the previous few years but still very respectable given the uncertainty of the times. A more important fact for the longer-run outlook is that, in comparison with the start of other recessions since the mid-1970s, the economy entered the recent slowdown with a much lower rate of inflation and a noticeably higher rate of increase in productivity. One favorable consequence of the subdued rate of inflation last year was that monetary policy was able to move aggressively to limit the extent of the downturn. Productivity growth during the recession has been even more strikingly out of character for a standard business cycle. Typically, a cyclical downturn in business activity leads to declines in or, at best, very anemic gains in labor productivity as firms struggle to adjust to declining demand and less efficient operating rates. However, by current estimates, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at a stunning annual rate of about 2-3/4 percent during the last three quarters of 2001--a pace equal to that which businesses were able to achieve over the previous three years of rapid economic expansion. That the recession does not appear to have much dented the rate of growth in productivity supports the view that the step-up in such growth that emerged in the mid-1990s resulted not only from the rapid expansion of real output but also from a more lasting shift in the structural trend rate of increase. The fundamental change in the pace of labor productivity seems to confirm what businesses were telling us--that they had used a wide range of technological advances and managerial innovations to improve their supply-chain management and information systems and to better tailor their products and services to meet customer demands. That is important because faster productivity growth is the crucial determinant of how quickly we can raise our nation's real standard of living. Productivity improvement has a bit of the same flavor as compound interest: For one year the number does not seem large. Only when considered over a period of years does it become dramatic. If productivity increases 1-1/2 percent per year on average, our standard of living will double about every forty-six years--or about every two generations. But if productivity rises 3 percent per year, the standard of living will double roughly every twenty-three years--or about every generation. Of course, while I can point to some favorable aspects of our economic performance during the recession, I also recognize that this recession, like the others before it, diminished job opportunities. Between the business cycle peak last March and this past January, employers shed almost 1-1/2 million jobs, and the unemployment rate rose more than 1 percentage point, to 5.6 percent, its highest level since mid-1995. Although the unemployment rate is still well below the peak rates reached in any recession since 1948, the comparison may be small comfort to those of you who are about to enter the labor market. Job opportunities in the current economic environment are obviously less favorable than what we enjoyed in the late 1990s. As is frequently the case when the economy is transitioning from contraction to expansion, uncertainty about the strength of the recovery is considerable. However, I am optimistic that, with the adjustments to production and inventories now largely behind us, the longer-run trends in productivity and output will begin to reassert themselves. And, while job prospects in the very near term may not turn out to be especially favorable, opportunities for building a successful long-term career in today's economy should, over time, be plentiful. Simply put, I believe that the next few years will prove to be a very good time to be a young person looking for interesting and challenging opportunities in business. But I would caution you that, even in a prosperous economy, individuals' success varies considerably. Thus, today's entrants to the workforce need to ask themselves how they can take maximum advantage of the opportunities they encounter. As I shift, here, from my perspective as an economic policymaker to my perspective as an observer of job-market and business-practice trends, I would like to describe some of the important changes that I have witnessed over the past several decades. To an economist, the clearest evidence of significant changes in the labor market during the 1980s and 1990s is the gap that opened between higher-paid workers and lower-paid workers. Most of that increase has resulted from exceptionally rapid gains in earnings for those in the upper half of the wage distribution, but you may be surprised to learn that it also represents a greater dispersion of outcomes for those with similar job titles and levels of education. This is a striking difference from other times--like those when Ron and I graduated from college. Let me repeat it with additional emphasis: Any two of you can enter the labor force with similar education backgrounds, and accept jobs that appear to be very much alike, but end up with a wide disparity in take-home pay. This issue is, I admit, complex, so let me first go over it in economic terms before adding some real-world observations. In broad terms, an important contributor to the rise in earnings inequality has been an increase in the premiums that firms are willing to pay for higher-level skills. For example, using education as one very rough measure of skill and using median usual weekly earnings as a wage measure, we can calculate a college wage premium as the ratio of wages for college-educated workers to wages for those with a high-school education. In 1979, that premium was about 40 percent; by the mid-1990s, it had increased to about 75 percent, and it has remained at that level since. Cutting the wage data another way, we find that even within the college-educated group, the ratio of median earnings of those at the 90th percentile of the college wage distribution to those at the 10th percentile has increased from 3.4 to 4.1 during the same period. Employers' needs for skills are often just associated with the capability to use new technologies, and one might assume that the forces driving the dispersion in pay would be strongest for jobs in information technology. But the skill premium is broader than that. Even among college graduates and among those with graduate degrees, employers are ready to pay a premium for managers who have the creativity and conceptual ability to apply their training and technological expertise to business lines in non-tech fields. For example, a recent study using detailed information on managerial pay structures within thirty-nine large companies found that the dispersion of compensation paid to managers within individual firms had increased because of differential rewards to those with higher levels of know-how, problem-solving skills, and accountability. Over the past twenty-five years, I have seen striking advances in information technology sweep through the financial services industry, and I have consulted with individuals in a broad range of other industries who report radical changes in how businesses operate--changes in production techniques, inventory management, distribution, sales, and marketing. Businesses have seen the scope of their products and services expand, and they are reaching a broader range of customers. And the changes have led these organizations to more highly value the managers and others who have the ability to understand and take advantage of the efficiencies offered by the new technologies. These changes, in turn, have led firms to reconfigure the way they advance and reward their employees. In particular, twenty-five years ago, the career path in many businesses looked much more predictable than it does today. A group of managers, for instance, would be hired by a firm in a particular year. These managers would tend to move up the management ladder together--usually promoted on the basis of seniority. In the process, they typically would accumulate broad experiences in a number of business areas within the organization, and a significant percentage would stay with their first employer for an entire career. In contrast, in today's work place, individuals gain responsibilities and become specialists much faster. Individuals with similar tenure may be promoted at much different rates, and, as suggested by the statistics showing rising earnings inequality within groups with similar education and experience, salary differentiation among employees is likely to be more pronounced than it used to be. Predictably, the person who stays with a single employer for an entire career is increasingly rare. Underlying this change in labor markets is the increasingly competitive environment in which firms find themselves. Given deregulation, global competition, and the resultant limits on pricing power in many industries, businesses are focusing more on the "bottom line" and are more aggressively searching for ways to improve their efficiency and profitability. They are asking what each unit within the company is contributing to the value of the firm. Many executives are increasingly interested in measuring the performance of individual units through the use of advanced accounting techniques--economic value-added systems being one example that has received a great deal of attention. Firms for which intangibles--brands, patents, software, research programs, and the like--are an important component of value have moved toward integrating, or at least producing, intellectual capital accounts in addition to the usual financial balance sheets. One result of this greater emphasis on firm value is that the work culture has become much more performance-based than it was twenty-five years ago. At the business-unit level, sales and marketing groups have had to become more responsive to the needs of their customers. Project life cycles are shorter now than in the past as firms aim to foster flexibility to keep up with the demand for new products. Businesses are looking for employees capable of expanding markets for their products and services or of developing innovative ways to reduce costs. They want to measure what their workers contribute to the value of the firm, and they are increasingly willing to reward their workers according to these contributions. Thus, as I noted above, firms have made their pay systems much more flexible and now routinely use merit-pay systems that base salary increases and promotions on performance. In addition, firms have increased their use of variable pay or have raised the potential value of bonus systems already in place. The most striking example of the expanded use of variable pay has been the sharp rise in stock-option grants in recent years. According to one survey, the number of U.S. corporations with employee stock ownership plans rose from just 200 in 1974 to roughly 10,000 in 1998. More important, these stock options are no longer limited to the top executives in a company. According to a recent KPMG survey of 133 companies, 72 percent of middle managers, 35 percent of all union-exempt employees, and 12 percent of nonexempt employees were eligible to receive stock option awards. Of course, as those whose options fell out of the money well know, stock options do not automatically translate into higher income. But for many, stock options paid off handsomely during the late 1990s. More than 50 percent of adults in the United States now participate in some form of stock ownership in large part because of participation in either stock option programs or retirement plans that invest in stocks. Another change in recent years is the greater tendency of firms to reconfigure work arrangements, both to increase their ability to adjust labor inputs and as a way to reward valuable employees. The most obvious examples are the increased reliance by many firms on temporary-help workers and contract employees. Both provide businesses with greater flexibility to alter the size of their workforces. But even for permanent employees, the employment relation between the firm and its workers has changed significantly. The rise in the use of less-traditional conditions of employment is one clear example of this. In particular, highly valued employees now have greater power to negotiate customized work arrangements suited to their own preferences. Such arrangements might include telecommuting, flexible hours, developmental leave, and a variety of other possibilities. Again, the underlying rationale for the firm is to provide a way to reward workers for good performance. While offering more flexible work environments and performance rewards, employers also have raised their expectations about their employees' willingness to develop their own individual capabilities. Workers today are pressed to invest in skill development and to seek new opportunities and experiences that will increase their value to the company. Employees can no longer rely on what they learned in school to suffice for their entire careers. Rather, today's workers are expected to accumulate an ever-expanding range of skills over their working lives--both on-the-job and through additional training. The real value of the formal education that you are now receiving is that, with it, you will be able to enter jobs in which you very likely will be challenged to learn more, to try new assignments, and to take some risks. One of the exciting--and admittedly unsettling--aspects of the economy in recent years is that we cannot predict exactly where technical change will take us, even in the fairly near term. That is, we cannot forecast what our business practices and products will look like only a decade ahead--over a period of time, say, in which your careers will have just begun. I have witnessed such a transformation as technological change has swept through the banking and financial services industries over the past ten years, and I have been a more-distant observer of the process in many other exciting areas--biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture, to name just a few. In sum, I will offer this advice as you make the transition from your university training to business. First, take with you not simply your BA or MBA but also a willingness to be flexible, a keen eye for new opportunities to increase your value on the job, and an appetite for lifelong learning. Second, leave here knowing your current strengths and what you enjoy, but be open to change. As those strengths and preferences are tested on the job, you should be looking for opportunities that kindle your creative spark and, as a consequence, give you great satisfaction. And if that process leads you in a different direction, do not be afraid to change course and follow it. Footnotes K.C. O'Shaughnessy, David I.
