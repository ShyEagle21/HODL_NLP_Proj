Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan Economic outlook Before the Joint Economic Committee, U.S. Congress November 3, 2005 Mr. Chairman, when I last appeared before the Joint Economic Committee in early June, economic activity appeared to be reaccelerating after a slowdown in the spring. The economy had weathered a further run-up in energy prices over the winter, and aggregate demand was again strengthening. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate over the first half of the year, and subsequent readings on activity over the summer were positive. By early August, the economy appeared to have considerable momentum, despite a further ratcheting up of crude oil prices; pressures on inflation remained elevated. As you know, the economy suffered significant shocks in late summer and early autumn. Crude oil prices moved sharply higher in August, bid up by growth in world demand that continued to outpace the growth of supply. Then Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast at the end of August, causing widespread disruptions to oil and natural gas production and driving the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil above $70 per barrel. Because of a lack of ready access to foreign supplies, natural gas prices rose even more sharply. At the end of September, with the recovery from the first storm barely under way, Hurricane Rita hit, causing additional damage and destruction--especially to the energy production and distribution systems in the Gulf. Most recently, Hurricane Wilma caused widespread power outages and property damage across the state of Florida. These events are likely to exert a drag on employment and production in the near term and to add to the upward pressures on the general price level. But the economic fundamentals remain firm, and the U.S. economy appears to retain important forward momentum. Of course, the higher energy prices caused by the hurricanes are being felt well beyond the Gulf Coast region. Those higher prices resulted from the substantial damage that occurred to our nation's energy production and distribution systems. Of the more than 3,000 oil and gas production platforms in the paths of Katrina and Rita, more than 100 were destroyed, and an additional 50 suffered extensive damage. Of the 134 manned drilling rigs operating in the Gulf, 8 were lost, and an additional 38 were either set adrift by the storms or were badly damaged. At present, both oil and natural gas production in the Gulf are operating at less than 50 percent of pre-Katrina levels. Since the first evacuations of oil and gas facilities were ordered before Katrina, cumulative shortfalls represented almost 4 percent of the nation's annual production of crude oil and 2 percent of our output of natural gas. The combination of flooding, wind damage, and a lack of electric power also forced many crude oil refineries and natural gas processing plants to shut down. The restoration of production at the affected natural gas processing facilities has proceeded particularly slowly, in part because of the lack of natural gas feedstocks and infrastructure problems. Most refineries, however, will be back on line within the next month or so, though a few may take longer. In the interim, a greater output of refined petroleum products in other areas of the country and much higher imports, especially of gasoline, are making up for the production shortfalls in Gulf refining. The temporary lifting of some environmental regulations and the suspension of the Jones Act facilitated those adjustments. In addition, refiners have shifted the mix of production toward more gasoline and less heating oil and jet fuel. That shift has had benefits in the short run, though the longer it continues, the greater the possibility of upward pressure on distillate fuel oil prices during the winter heating season. Releases from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve relieved much of the upward pressure on crude oil prices, and imports of refined products responded rapidly to ease the price pressures stemming from the loss of refinery production in the Gulf. As a consequence, the nationwide retail price of gasoline for all grades has declined 60 cents per gallon from its peak of $3.12 per gallon in the week of September 5. Motorists appear to have economized on their driving, and gasoline demand appears to be off a bit. However, it will take time and an appreciable increase in the fuel economy of our stock of motor vehicles to fundamentally change the amount of motor fuel used on our nation's highways. The far more severe reaction of natural gas prices to the production setbacks that have occurred in the Gulf highlights again the need to expand our nation's ability to import natural gas. In contrast to the fall in crude oil prices and the sharp narrowing of refinery margins during the past two months, natural gas prices have remained high. Moreover, judging from elevated distant futures prices, traders expect natural gas prices to edge lower but to stay high for the foreseeable future. This expectation largely reflects a natural gas industry in North America that is already operating at close to capacity and our inability to import large quantities of far cheaper, liquefied natural gas (LNG) from other parts of the world. At present, natural gas supplies appear to be sufficient to meet the near-term demands--even with some ongoing shortfall in Gulf production. However, a colder-than-average winter would stress this market, and prices will likely remain vulnerable to spikes until the spring. U.S. imports of LNG have been constrained by inadequate global capacity for liquefaction, as well as by environmental and safety concerns that have restricted the construction of new LNG import terminals in the United States. In 2002, such imports accounted for only 1 percent of U.S. gas consumption. Despite the major effort to expand imports, the Department of Energy forecasts LNG imports this year at only 3 percent of gas consumption. Canada, which has recently supplied one-sixth of our consumption, cannot expand its pipeline exports significantly in the near term, in part because of the role that Canadian natural gas plays in supporting increasing oil production from tar sands. The disruptions to energy production have noticeably affected economic activity. We estimate that the storms held down the increase in industrial production 0.4 percentage point in August and an additional 1.7 percentage point in September. Except for the hurricane effects, readings on the economy indicate a continued solid expansion of aggregate demand and production. If allowance is taken for the effects of Katrina and Rita and for the now-settled machinist strike at Boeing, industrial production rose at an annual rate of 5-1/4 percent in the third quarter. That's up from an annual pace of 1-1/4 percent in the second quarter, when a marked slowing of inventory accumulation was a restraining influence on growth. The September employment report showed a loss of 35,000 jobs. However, an upward revision to payroll gains over the summer indicated a stronger underlying pace of hiring before the storms than had been previously estimated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that employment growth in areas not affected by the storms was in line with the average pace over the twelve months ending in August. Retail spending eased off in September, likely reflecting the effects of the hurricanes and higher gasoline prices. Major chain stores report a gradual recovery over October in the pace of spending, though light motor vehicle sales declined sharply last month, when some major incentives to purchase expired. The longer-term prospects for the U.S. economy remain favorable. Structural productivity continues to grow at a firm pace, and rebuilding activity following the hurricanes should boost real GDP growth for a while. More uncertainty, however, surrounds the outlook for inflation. The past decade of low inflation and solid economic growth in the United States and in many other countries around the world has been without precedent in recent decades. Much of that favorable performance is attributable to the remarkable confluence of innovations that spawned new computer, telecommunication, and networking technologies, which, especially in the United States, have elevated the growth of productivity, suppressed unit labor costs, and helped to contain inflationary pressures. The result has been a virtuous cycle of low prices and solid growth. Contributing to the disinflationary pressures that have been evident in the global economy over the past decade or more has been the integration of in excess of 100 million educated workers from the former Soviet bloc into the world's open trading system. More recently, and of even greater significance, has been the freeing from central planning of large segments of China's 750 million workforce. The gradual addition of these workers plus workers from India--a country which is also currently undergoing a notable increase in its participation in the world trading system--would approximately double the overall supply of labor once all these workers become fully engaged in competitive world markets. Of course, at current rates of productivity, the half of the world's labor force that has been newly added to the world competitive marketplace is producing no more than one quarter of world output. With increased education and increased absorption of significant cutting-edge technologies, that share will surely rise. Over the past decade or more, the gradual assimilation of these new entrants into the world's free-market trading system has restrained the rise of unit labor costs in much of the world and hence has helped to contain inflation. As this process has unfolded, inflation expectations have decreased, and accordingly, the inflation premiums embodied in long-term interest rates around the world have come down. The effective augmentation of world supply and the accompanying disinflationary pressures have made it easier for the Federal Reserve and other central banks to achieve price stability in an environment of generally solid economic growth. But this seminal shift in the world's workforce is producing, in effect, a level adjustment in unit labor costs. To be sure, economic systems evolve from centrally planned to market-based only gradually and, at times, in fits and starts. Thus, this level adjustment is being spread over an extended period. Nevertheless, the suppression of cost growth and world inflation, at some point, will begin to abate and, with the completion of this level adjustment, gradually end. These global forces pressing inflation and interest rates lower may well persist for some time. Nonetheless, it is the rate at which countries are integrated into the global economic system, not the extent of their integration, that governs the degree to which the rise in world unit labor costs will continue to be subdued. Where the global economy is currently in this dynamic process remains open to question. But going forward, these trends will need to be monitored carefully by the world's central banks. * * * I want to conclude with a few remarks about the federal budget situation, which--at least until Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the Gulf Coast--was showing signs of modest improvement. Indeed, tax receipts have exhibited considerable strength of late, posting an increase of nearly 15 percent in fiscal 2005 as a result of sizable gains in individual and, even more, corporate income taxes. Thus, although spending continued to rise rapidly last year, the deficit in the unified budget dropped to $319 billion, nearly $100 billion less than the figure for fiscal year 2004 and a much smaller figure than many had anticipated earlier in the year. Lowering the deficit further in the near term, however, will be difficult in light of the need to pay for post-hurricane reconstruction and relief. But even apart from the hurricanes, our budget position is unlikely to improve substantially further until we restore constraints similar to the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, which were allowed to lapse in 2002. Even so, the restoration of paygo and discretionary caps will not address the far more difficult choices that confront the Congress as the baby-boom generation edges toward retirement. As I have testified on numerous occasions, current entitlement law may have already promised to this next generation of retirees more in real resources than our economy, with its predictably slowing rate of labor force growth, will be able to supply. So long as health-care costs continue to grow faster than the economy as a whole, as seems likely, federal spending on health and retirement programs would rise at a rate that risks placing the budget on an unsustainable trajectory. Specifically, large deficits will result in rising interest rates and an ever-growing ratio of debt service to GDP. Unless the situation is reversed, at some point these budget trends will cause serious economic disruptions. We owe it to those who will retire over the next couple of decades to promise only what the government can deliver. The present policy path makes current promises, at least in real terms, highly conjectural. If fewer resources will be available per retiree than promised under current law, those in their later working years need sufficient time to adjust their work and retirement decisions. Crafting a budget strategy that meets the nation's longer-run needs will become ever more difficult and costly the more we delay. The one certainty is that the resolution of the nation's demographic challenge will require hard choices and that the future performance of the economy will depend on those choices. No changes will be easy, as they all will involve setting priorities and making tradeoffs among valued alternatives. The Congress must determine how best to address the competing claims on our limited resources. In doing so, you will need to consider not only the distributional effects of policy changes but also the broader economic effects on labor supply, retirement behavior, and private saving. The benefits of taking sound, timely action could extend many decades into the future.
Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. At the Cato Institute 23rd Annual Monetary Conference on Monetary Institutions & Economic Development, Washington, D.C. November 3, 2005 Monetary Credibility, Inflation, and Economic Growth By now it must be universally agreed that low and stable inflation is a primary and essential goal for monetary policy, in large part because we believe it brings stability to financial systems and fosters sustainable economic growth over the longer run. ï¿½In pursuit of this goal, central banks can report some success.ï¿½ According to the latest World Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), consumer price inflation in the advanced economies over the decade beginning in 1997 and ending next year looks set to come in at an average annual rate of less than 2 percent, down from 3-1/2 percent for the previous ten years.ï¿½ The IMF figures for the United States show a smaller but still substantial decline in headline inflation, from about 3-3/4 percent to 2-1/2 percent.ï¿½ The drop in inflation for the non-industrial economies has been more striking, with average inflation falling from double to single digits over the same time periods. As someone who started work as a monetary policymaker in 1997, I am happy to acknowledge the accomplishments of many policymakers at the Federal Reserve and in other central banks around the world. ï¿½Thanks to their success in fighting inflation, the central banking profession enjoys a very high standing.ï¿½ And as a related matter, we might say that monetary credibility, which I would define as the perception in the private sector that central banks will do what it takes to keep inflation under control, is also quite high. This credibility is hard won, however, and can be easily lost. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at its most recent meeting increased the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4 percent, and observed: The cumulative rise in energy and other costs has the potential to add to inflation pressures; however, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. . .With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Unfortunately, however, the story over the past twenty years is not so uniformly positive for growth. Again according to IMF figures, growth among the non-industrial economies appears to have increased to about 5-1/4 percent in the decade beginning in 1997, compared with growth of 3-3/4 percent in the previous ten years. Growth in the United States has also moved slightly higher over the two periods, from 3 percent to 3-1/4 percent. However, growth in the other industrial economies has softened, to less than 2-1/2 percent in the recent decade from more than 3 percent in the previous one. This decline reflects slowing in some of the larger economies--Japan, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands--as well as the effect of the Asian crisis in 1997 on newly industrialized Asian economies. To me, it is axiomatic that monetary credibility, by reducing the level and variability of inflation, lays the foundations for stronger and more-sustained economic growth. In my remarks today, I want to discuss anecdotal and academic evidence for the relationship between monetary policy credibility and economic growth and to do so in two segments: first, the link between monetary policy credibility and inflation performance and, second, the link between inflation performance and longer-run economic growth. Before proceeding, I must indicate that the views I am about to express are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of other members of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. Monetary Policy Credibility and Inflation Performance Outcomes Does monetary credibility help secure lower inflation, less-variable inflation, and inflation that is less sensitive to shocks? Low and stable inflation must start with sound policy--that is, policy that keeps output near potential and offsets shocks to supply and demand appropriately. But beyond that, common intuition and numerous academic journal articles, a few of which I will discuss shortly, suggest that credibility can greatly enhance the virtues of sound policy. When the central bank is viewed to be both committed to and effective at keeping inflation contained, inflation expectations will tend to be anchored. And so long as the central bank pursues sensible policies, those expectations will tend to be self-fulfilling, as they should lead to movements in prices and wages that are consistent with inflation staying low and stable. Conversely, if credibility is lacking and inflation expectations are high, firms will be raising prices, and workers will be demanding large wage increases, making it more costly, in terms of jobs and output, for the central bank to tighten policy sufficiently to achieve low inflation. One does not have to look far to see examples of the practical importance of monetary credibility. In the past two years, crude oil prices have about doubled. During the 1970s, similar run-ups set off sharp increases in global inflation. Today, by contrast, core inflation rates both in the United States and abroad, while they have moved up some, remain essentially contained. In large part, they remain so because central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have substantially bolstered their commitment to price stability since the 1970s and markets are now much more confident that monetary authorities will keep inflation from rebounding. Accordingly, rising oil prices have not triggered a sharp rebound in long-term inflation expectations, and we have not seen the anticipatory hikes in prices and wages that were so destabilizing a few decades back. In essence, monetary credibility helps the central bank do its job, by inducing private sector participants also to take actions that help achieve the central bank's low inflation objective. Of course, given the persistence of high energy prices that the global economy has confronted of late, policymakers cannot be complacent. Central bankers must reinforce their credibility and validate the confidence of market participants by actively leaning against inflationary pressures long before inflation itself builds. Again, the FOMC has done just that through its commitment to adjust policy as required to keep inflation at bay. Aside from such anecdotal evidence, much formal research supports the view that a strong commitment to price stability helps reduce and stabilize inflation. For example, Gagnon and Ihrig, staff economists at the Federal Reserve, have studied the effects of monetary policy on the response of inflation to currency depreciation. They show that, over the past few decades, the sensitivity of inflation to currency depreciation has generally declined in industrial economies. For 18 of the 20 industrial countries studied, the authors find that the rate of pass-through of currency depreciation to inflation fell as the rate of inflation declined between 1971 and 2000, with pass-through in the second half of the sample period averaging about a third of what it was in the first half. In addition, they find that these declines tended to be larger in countries where central banks increased the weight they placed on fighting inflation. The Gagnon and Ihrig result represents evidence that a strong commitment to price stability can lead to more-stable prices, but it leaves open the extent to which central bank credibility--as opposed to policy action--contributes to this outcome. Other research, conducted by Laxton and N'Diaye at the IMF, shows that a model of inflation and unemployment performs better when inflation expectations are entered into the model as a function of long-term bond yields than when such expectations are assumed to depend on past inflation alone. Thus, their research affirms the influence of inflation expectations on actual inflation. Whether these expectations reflect monetary credibility, as the researchers argue, remains unclear. Finally, there is considerable literature on the effects of central bank independence on inflation. In one standard view, politically motivated desires to stimulate the economy, run budget deficits, or redistribute wealth in favor of one social group or another are important sources of inflationary pressure. These pressures have long been part of the political landscape, and indeed, it was for these reasons that the framers of the Federal Reserve sought to insulate the Fed from political pressures. That central bank independence frees the monetary authority to pursue price stability more diligently, resulting in lower and less-variable inflation, is supported by many studies. Inflation tends to be lower in countries where there are legal and other institutional safeguards to central bank independence. Of course, such results still do not tell us whether central bank independence matters mainly because it allows the central bank to pursue better policies or because it boosts the central bank's credibility. In spite of this ample academic evidence of the role of good policy and central bank independence in achieving price stability, we must face the fact that the particular contribution of monetary credibility, as contrasted with the contribution of central bank policies themselves, is difficult to measure. Not only does effective central bank policy lead to good inflation outcomes, but it is the primary contributor to monetary credibility. Sound policy and credibility are tightly, and perhaps inextricably, intertwined and cannot be separately measured with current statistical techniques. Am I bothered by the paucity of direct academic evidence regarding the specific role of monetary credibility? Not at all. The research I have briefly described makes clear that a commitment to fighting inflation, low inflation expectations, and central bank independence all contribute to restraining inflation. Thus, it would be surprising if monetary credibility did not play a role, even if, because it cannot be directly measured, its specific contribution is hard to gauge. Moreover, theory and intuition tell us that monetary credibility will be greatest when the central bank does what it is supposed to do: offset economic shocks to keep price pressures from building and thereby keep inflation itself low and stable. The effective central bank will pursue such policies regardless of how important it believes the role of monetary credibility to be. Inflation Performance and Economic Growth Assuming that monetary credibility does make it easier for central banks to pursue the objective of price stability, what can we say about how stable prices affect the bottom line--economic activity and growth? Empirical research attempting to establish solid links between low inflation and sustainable economic growth has met with mixed success, in part because of the many complicated factors determining both inflation and growth. Following seminal work by Stanley Fischer, researchers seem to agree that extreme inflation rates, say above 40 percent per year, are associated with reduced economic growth. Such high rates of inflation are often a sign of an economy in or approaching crisis, and once inflation crosses the threshold of 40 percent, inflation is considerably more unstable and likely to rise. Under such conditions, firms have great difficulty in setting prices and consumers in appraising them. In general, growth slows during such crises, as evidenced by the collapse of the Argentine economy during its hyperinflation at the end of the 1980s or the ravages of the European hyperinflations of the 1920s. In these situations, the association between growth and inflation is clear, although causality can be difficult to disentangle. But what can we say about lower inflation rates? Is the pace of economic development slower when inflation is at 15 percent than when it is at 5 percent? Research by IMF staff economists Khan and Senhadji has turned up a negative association between inflation and growth. Using nonlinear estimation techniques, these economists report finding thresholds above which inflation significantly slows growth. The thresholds identified in this work are 1 percent to 3 percent for industrial economies and 11 percent to 12 percent for developing economies. To be completely fair regarding the academic literature, however, others have not found such a clear relationship. Levine and Renelt (1992), for example, found no robust relationship in exhaustive cross-section studies, and many researchers using other techniques have also failed to detect a significant relationship. The problem may lie in identifying the direction of causation: In the short-to-medium run, causality may run from higher growth to higher inflation, as business-cycle pressures push spending and activity above the economy's capacity. This direction of causality may obscure the negative relationship, running from higher inflation to lower growth, presumed to hold in the longer term. Of course, as a central banker, it makes sense to me that lower and more-stable inflation, by making the returns to saving and investment more predictable and by diminishing the likelihood of shocks to the financial system, should encourage economic growth. For example, the United States has experienced a higher average, and less volatile, growth rate since the mid-1980s. This "Great Moderation" has been attributed by most observers, at least in part, to improved monetary policy and, by extension, to lower and more-stable inflation. Low and stable inflation offers other benefits as well, which may affect the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) over time. These include reducing the arbitrary redistributions of wealth and income associated with higher and more-variable inflation and shrinking the distortions to resource allocation in the tax code. Accordingly, and I am obviously not alone in this view, it is clear that central banks should strive to achieve low, stable inflation. Of course, low inflation is at best a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for growth. In many poor economies, inflation may be less of an obstacle to development than poor governance, inadequate education, and legal systems that fail to protect property rights or to enforce commercial contracts. Yet, no tradeoff forces countries to choose between lowering inflation and reforming their institutions. On the contrary, high inflation is often a sign of institutional breakdown, and reducing inflation may help to rebuild confidence in economic and political prospects. Conclusion In conclusion, let us not forget that the declines in inflation over the past two decades and the resulting boost to monetary credibility we currently enjoy were earned with some economic pain, as the pace of economic activity was slowed, at times severely, to bring inflation down. With longer-run inflation expectations better anchored now throughout the world, I believe that global economic growth will be stronger and more resilient as a result. If the academic evidence does not yet unequivocally support this conclusion, perhaps it is because we are only starting to see the return to sacrifices made in the past. My generation of central bankers has the job of maintaining the victories of the previous generation and of using all our tools to keep inflation expectations contained and inflation low and stable. We owe our predecessors and our fellow citizens nothing less.

Testimony of Governor Susan Schmidt Bies Basel II implementation and revisions to Basel I Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate November 10, 2005 Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and members of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, I thank you for the opportunity to join my colleagues from the other federal banking agencies to discuss the current status of Basel II in this country, as well as the status of proposed amendments to our existing Basel I-based capital rules. Introduction The Federal Reserve considers the maintenance of strong and stable financial markets as an integral part of our responsibility and critically related to safety and soundness of the participants in those markets. Financial stability contributes to sustained economic growth by providing an environment in which financial institutions, businesses, and households can conduct their business with more certainty about future outcomes. Part of maintaining a strong financial system is ensuring that banking organizations operate in a safe and sound manner with adequate capital cushions that appropriately support the risks they take. As many of you are aware, there have been two major developments within the past six weeks regarding U.S. regulatory capital requirements that apply to banking institutions. First, on September 30, the U.S. banking agencies announced their revised plan for the implementation of the Basel II framework in the United States. Second, the agencies published for comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) pertaining to amendments to the existing Basel I-based capital rules (the amended Basel I). Taken together, these proposals on Basel II and the amended Basel I represent substantial revisions to the regulatory risk-based capital rules applied to U.S. banking institutions, from the very largest to the smallest. From the Federal Reserve's perspective, these two initiatives, when implemented successfully, should produce a much-improved regulatory capital regime in the United States that enhances safety and soundness. The Federal Reserve considers the ongoing discussion between the Congress and the U.S. banking agencies--and, of course, with the banking industry and members of the public--to be critical to the success of both sets of proposals. Reasons for Pursuing Basel II We have all witnessed the substantial changes in the U.S. banking industry over the past decade, including growth in size and geographic scope, expansion of activities, development of new instruments and services, and greater use of technology. As a result, we have seen the rise of very large entities with large geographic reach operating in many lines of business and engaging in complex and sophisticated transactions. The largest institutions have moved away from the traditional banking strategy of holding assets on the balance sheet to strategies that emphasize redistribution of assets and actively managing risks. These dramatic changes to the risk profiles of many banking organizations have only accelerated with the continued evolution of many, often complex, financial tools, such as securtitizations and credit derivatives. Additionally, risk-management techniques employed by many banking organizations continue to change, improve, and adapt to the ever-changing financial landscape. For instance, operational risk was not part of our risk-management thinking ten years ago, but tools to identify, measure, and manage it are now becoming prevalent. Also, the lines between the banking book and the trading book have blurred significantly and organizations continue to move resources and products to optimize earnings and manage risks. And finally, global competition has intensified significantly, as the ability of customers to choose from a variety of local and international banking firms, as well as nonbank competitors, has increased. While the current Basel I-based rules have served us well for nearly two decades, they are simply not appropriate for identifying and measuring the risks of our largest, most complex banking organizations. Basel I, even when periodically amended, must be straightforward enough for even the smallest banking organizations to implement with relative ease. Thus, the categories of risk used to determine capital are very broad and are intended to capture the "average" risk levels across the banking system for that generic exposure. Large financial institutions, however, tend to manage risk in more proactive ways, and are able to take advantage of new innovations in financial instruments to hedge, sell, or take on risk exposures to support their business strategies and profitability targets. As a result, they are able to remove balance sheet exposures for risks where they feel regulatory capital is set too high, and thereby reduce minimum regulatory capital. Smaller organizations generally do not have the risk-management systems or scale of transactions to make these practices economically viable. While the balance sheet focus of Basel I is appropriate for most banking organizations, the largest organizations have significant exposures off the books, and these risk exposures need to be considered explicitly in determining minimum regulatory capital for these sophisticated organizations. Large organizations are increasingly gravitating toward fee-based revenue streams. This is due to securitizations of loan portfolios that retain the responsibility of servicing the loans, buying and selling financial instruments for customers, and growth in business lines where fees are generated by transactions and account processing. These activities have little exposure shown on the balance sheet at a moment in time, but failure to operate complex systems and negotiate complex financial deals in a sound manner can lead to large loss exposures given the volume of activity that runs through the line of business. They also use sophisticated models to manage credit, market, and interest rate risks. Poor data integrity, model reliability or lack of sufficient controls, can create losses when management action relies on the faulty results of decision models. Finally, the complexity of these organizations makes it more difficult for executive management to view risk in a comprehensive way, both in terms of aggregating similar and correlated risks, but also in identifying potential conflicts of interest between the growth of a line of business and the reputation, legal, and compliance risks of the firm as a whole. In recent years, large financial institutions have reported losses from breaks in these operating controls that in some cases have exceeded those in credit or market risk. The Basel II framework should improve supervisors' ability to understand and monitor the risk taking and capital adequacy of large complex institutions, thereby allowing regulators to address emerging problems more proactively. It should also enhance the ability of market participants, through public disclosures, to evaluate the risk positions at those institutions by providing much better risk measures. The advanced approaches under Basel II, which include the advanced internal ratings-based approach (or A-IRB) for credit risk and the advanced measurement approaches (or AMA) for operational risk, offer particularly good improvements in terms of risk sensitivity, since they incorporate advanced risk-management processes already used today by best-practice institutions. Indeed, the expected improvements in risk measurement and risk management form the core of our reasons for proposing Basel II in the United States. Its advanced approaches create a rational link between regulatory capital and risk management. Under these approaches, institutions would be required to adopt a set of quantitative risk-measurement and sophisticated risk-management procedures and processes. For instance, Basel II establishes standards for data collection and the systematic use of the information collected. These standards are consistent with broader supervisory expectations that high-quality risk management at large complex organizations depends upon credible data. Enhancements to technological infrastructure--combined with detailed data--will, over time, allow firms to better track exposures and manage risk. The emphasis in Basel II on improved data standards should not be interpreted solely as a requirement to determine regulatory capital standards, but rather as a foundation for more advanced risk-management practices that would strengthen the value of the banking franchise. But while the new framework would, in our view, provide useful incentives for institutions to accelerate the improvement of risk management, we believe that in most areas of risk management institutions would continue to have the choice among which methods they employ. Thus, from a safety and soundness regulatory perspective, for these large, complex financial organizations, regulators and market participants need the information provided by the advanced framework of Basel II. Recent Developments with Basel II The Federal Reserve considers the agencies' September 30 announcement relating to Basel II a good outcome and an example of successful interagency cooperation. As you may recall, in April of this year the agencies announced jointly their reaction to initial results of a fourth quantitative impact study pertaining to Basel II, known as QIS4. As the April statement indicated, we were concerned about results from QIS4 that showed a wider dispersion and a larger overall drop in minimum regulatory capital requirements for the QIS4 population of institutions than the agencies had initially expected. The initial QIS4 results prompted the agencies to delay issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for Basel II in order to conduct further analysis of those results and their potential impact. The agencies' reaction to the initial QIS4 results, deciding to take additional time to understand more fully the information provided by the QIS4 institutions, is an indicator of how seriously we are taking Basel II implementation. During the summer, the U.S. agencies conducted additional analysis of the information reported in QIS4. That analysis is for the most part complete. Based on the new knowledge gained from the additional QIS4 analysis, the U.S. agencies collectively decided to move ahead with an NPR but adjust the plan for U.S. implementation of Basel II. Adjustments to the plan include extending the timeline for implementation and augmenting the transitional floors, which should provide bankers and regulators with more experience with Basel II before it is fully implemented in the United States. In addition, the agencies stated specifically in our joint press release that after completing a final rule for Basel II, we intend to revisit that rule prior to the termination of the transitional floors. That is, we expect to perform additional in-depth analyses of the Basel II minimum capital calculations produced by institutions during the parallel run and transitional floor periods before we move to full implementation without floors. This is consistent with the overall process we have laid out for implementing Basel II. We want to ensure that the minimum regulatory capital levels for each institution and in the aggregate for the group of Basel II banks provide an adequate capital cushion consistent with safety and soundness. Probably the most important thing we learned from the QIS4 analysis is that progress is being made toward developing a risk-sensitive capital system. In terms of the specifics of the analysis, we learned that the drop in QIS4 capital was largely due to the favorable point in the business cycle when the data were collected. While the previous QIS3 exercise was conducted with data from 2002, a higher credit loss year, QIS4 reflected asset portfolio, risk-management information and models during one of the best periods of credit quality in recent years. We learned that the dispersion was largely due to varying risk parameters used by the institutions, which was permissible in the QIS4 exercise, but also due to portfolio differences. That is, banks have different approaches to risk-management processes, and their models and databases reflect those differences. We also learned that some of the data submitted by individual institutions was not complete; in some cases banks did not have estimates of loss in stress periods--or used estimates that we thought were not very sophisticated--which caused minimum regulatory capital to be underestimated. Based on the results of QIS4, the Federal Reserve recognizes that all institutions have additional work to do. In our view, the findings did not point to insurmountable problems, but instead identified areas for future supervisory focus. In that way, the analysis was critical in providing comfort to enable us to move forward. It is also helpful to remember that the QIS4 exercise was conducted on a best-efforts basis. It was just one step in a progression of events leading to adoption of the Basel II framework. We certainly expect that as we move closer to implementation, supervisory oversight of the Basel II implementation methodologies by our examination teams would increase. Indeed, during the qualification process we expect to have several additional opportunities to evaluate institutions' risk-management processes, models, and estimates--and provide feedback to the institutions on their progress. So while the QIS4 results clearly provided a much better sense than before of the progress in implementing Basel II and offered additional insights about the link between risks and capital, QIS4 should not be considered a complete forecast of Basel II's ultimate effects. It was a point-in-time look at how the U.S. implementation was progressing. Institutions participating in QIS4 put a lot of time and effort into assisting with the QIS4 analysis. For that reason, we owe it to the institutions to provide feedback prior to engaging in a detailed public discussion of the findings. Those feedback sessions, a full interagency effort involving an interagency agreed-upon presentation of the results, are now underway and we expect them to be largely completed by the end of this month. The agencies plan to release a public document describing our findings shortly after these sessions are completed, we hope by the end of the year. Proposed Next Steps in the Basel II Process I would now like to describe some possible next steps in the Basel II process. To be clear, these thoughts represent our best estimates at this time and could change, given the extensive opportunity for public comment and additional interagency discussions to come. But I thought it would at least be helpful to offer the Federal Reserve's perspective. First, we support the idea of finishing an NPR on Basel II and related supervisory guidance as soon as possible, which right now looks to be in the first quarter of 2006. We believe that the best way to further augment our understanding of the impact of Basel II is to issue the NPR and hear reaction from the Congress, the industry, and the public. In addition, we are interested in issuing the NPR and related supervisory guidance as soon as possible so that bankers can have a better idea of supervisory expectations relating to Basel II. The NPR will help bankers identify the areas where they need to strengthen their risk-measurement processes as they continue to prepare for adoption of Basel II. After the end of the NPR comment period, the agencies plan to review the comments and decide more specifically on how to move forward. The agencies would then develop a strategy for issuing a final rule on Basel II, of course taking into account comments received. Once the final rule is issued, those institutions moving to Basel II would complete preparations to move to a parallel run, a period in which minimum regulatory capital measures under both Basel II and Basel I will be calculated. Under the current timeline, the parallel run would start in January 2008. The parallel run period, which is intended to last for four continuous quarters, should provide us with additional key information about the expected results for Basel II on a bank-by-bank basis, as well as the level of bank preparedness to operate under Basel II. Once an institution conducts a successful parallel run, the relevant primary federal supervisor would then confirm the bank's readiness and give permission for the institution to move to the first initial phase of adoption, into the initial floor period. It is only after an institution has operated to the primary supervisor's satisfaction in the parallel run and each of the three years of floors that it would be allowed to have its minimum regulatory capital requirements determined by Basel II with no floors. During U.S. implementation of Basel II, if at any stage in the process we see something that concerns the banking agencies, we will reassess and propose amendments to relevant parts of the framework. The agencies have already decided to embed in the planned timeline the possibility for a later revision to the initial Basel II rule (before the floors are removed), since it is expected that new information provided in the parallel run and floor years might point to a need for adjustments to that initial rule. This is entirely consistent with the path we have taken in the past regarding Basel I, to which there have been more than twenty-five revisions since 1989. The Federal Reserve considers all of the planned safeguards and checks and balances to be sufficient for Basel II to be implemented in the United States effectively, and with no negative impact on safety and soundness or the functioning of banking markets. Proposed Amendments to Basel I As I noted, the Basel II proposal is not the only minimum regulatory capital proposal being contemplated by the U.S. banking agencies. We have issued an ANPR for amendments to Basel I that is another important initiative in our efforts to update regulatory capital rules. The regulatory capital rules to be amended by the ANPR would apply to thousands of banking institutions in the United States, while the Basel II proposal would likely only apply to ten to twenty at inception. The agencies are focusing considerable attention on the potential interplay between the proposed Basel II rules and the proposed Basel I amendments in order to ensure that the goals for each are achieved. The Federal Reserve's statement pertaining to the release of the ANPR highlighted that the revisions are intended to align risk-based capital requirements more closely with the risk inherent in various exposures. The ANPR relates, in part, to some long-standing issues in our current capital rules that have been identified (such as requiring capital for short-term commitments). We also noted that the amended Basel I is intended to mitigate certain competitive inequalities that may arise from the implementation of Basel II rules (such as lowering the risk weight for some residential mortgage exposures). In considering these possible revisions, the U.S. agencies are seeking to enhance the evaluation of bank portfolios and their inherent risks without undue complexity or regulatory burden. In issuing the ANPR, an advance notice, the agencies are emphasizing that views are still being developed and additional comment from the banking industry and other interested parties would be both beneficial and welcome before we move forward. We are intentionally leaving a number of areas open in order to solicit a broad range of comments before we narrow down the range of possibilities. The U.S. banking agencies have identified over the past several years a number of issues that need to be addressed within our current Basel I rules. The development of Basel II-based rules also creates the need for the U.S. agencies to amend the current rules in order to address issues relating to competitive impact. While we view that impact as limited, we want to ensure that institutions not moving to Basel II have equal opportunities to pursue business initiatives and are not placed at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise adversely affected. That is why we are being very careful to analyze the potential results of these two efforts in tandem, and asking for the Congress, the industry, and others to provide comments on the potential effects of both initiatives. We believe that the revisions to Basel I-based rules should benefit most institutions by better reflecting current risk exposures in regulatory capital requirements at little additional burden. Naturally, regulatory capital requirements are usually not the binding constraint for banking organizations. Nearly all institutions hold capital in excess of the minimum required regulatory ratios, in many cases several percentage points above, to satisfy rating agencies, debtholders and shareholders, and counterparties in the market. By the same token, pricing in the banking industry is not driven by regulatory capital, but rather, as most would intuitively assume, by supply and demand and business decisions made by bankers. But we think regulatory capital can act as a useful gauge of risk-taking, even though it would not be the deciding factor in business decisions. With respect to the proposals for amended Basel I, as well as Basel II, the Federal Reserve fully supports retention of the existing prompt corrective action (PCA) regime, which the Congress put in place more than a decade ago, as well as existing leverage requirements. In addition to the safeguards planned for initiatives being discussed today, we at the Federal Reserve take comfort that the PCA and leverage requirements will continue to provide a level of protection for depositors, consumers, and the financial system as a whole. These regulations help to ensure a minimum level of capital at individual institutions and in the aggregate that we consider to be absolutely vital to the health of our banking system and the economy more broadly. Importance of the Rulemaking Process At the Federal Reserve--indeed, I think I can say among all the U.S. banking agencies--we understand and respect the rulemaking process and the legal requirements for implementing regulatory revisions. This, of course, includes comment periods for each of our regulatory capital proposals and transparency in our overall process. We encourage a healthy debate about the agencies' proposed initiatives--including the recently revised timeline for Basel II. We look forward to continuing to engage the industry, the Congress, fellow supervisors, and others in a discussion about what effects the Basel II framework and the Basel I revisions might have on our banking system. The proposals are intended to provide the right incentives for bankers, but if the proposals do not achieve this goal, we want to know why. In the past, when we have been provided with well-documented and convincing reasons for making a change to the Basel II framework or the U.S. implementation process, we have heeded those arguments. We expect to have the same posture regarding comments on the proposed Basel I amendments. We continue to recognize that vigorous discussion and debate produce a much better product. And we expect to remain vigilant about the potentially unintended and undesired consequences, particularly those that might affect a certain class of banks. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that from my perspective the U.S. agencies continue to work well with one another on these regulatory capital proposals in a general environment of cooperation and good will. While the U.S. agencies naturally disagree on certain policy matters and implementation issues from time to time, we at the Federal Reserve are pleased with the outcomes to date and recognize that all four agencies are making considerable contributions to the overall effort. Dialogue with the Industry The extension of the U.S. timeline for Basel II, along with the ongoing proposals for amended Basel I, obviously present some challenges for U.S. institutions. We will continue our efforts to ensure that we hear about these challenges and do our best to assist institutions in meeting them. First of all, bankers must keep track of the latest proposals and understand what they could mean for their own institutions. For those institutions looking to prepare for adoption of Basel II, making the manifold upgrades in risk-measurement and -management systems--not the least of which is developing credible databases--is even more difficult, especially since complete and final supervisory expectations have yet to be released. But we certainly hope that institutions do not lose momentum based on the revised timeline for Basel II; indeed, that timeline reflects our assessment of the work that still lies ahead. While institutions might be challenged to move forward in certain areas until the Basel II NPR and its associated supervisory guidance is issued, we still believe that they can make strides in other areas. For one, the agencies all along have emphasized the importance of institution-specific implementation plans, which include gap analyses, clearly defined milestones, and remediation plans. In other words, we think that institutions could now continue development of the corporate governance surrounding each institution's efforts in Basel II implementation and focus on their individual implementation processes. In addition, supervisors have begun to discuss individual QIS4 results with each participant; these discussions include specific feedback about the institution's results and some general peer comparisons. Additionally, we do recognize that the recent update to U.S. implementation plans could generate some challenges for U.S. institutions as they try to implement Basel II worldwide, as well as for foreign banks operating in the United States. Overall, we think these challenges are manageable and we can facilitate solutions to them during the implementation process. While not downplaying potential challenges, the U.S. agencies, in deciding to adjust implementation plans, thought it was important to ensure that implementation in the United States be conducted in a prudential manner and without generating competitive inequalities in our banking markets. As before the September 30 announcement, we continue to work with institutions and foreign supervisors to minimize the difficulties in cross-border implementation. Our support includes extensive discussion with other countries in the Basel Accord Implementation Group, as well as more informal, bilateral discussions with institutions and foreign supervisors. Our view is that these cross-border issues do not necessarily represent fundamentally new problems; while requiring some work, these challenges are manageable. It is also useful to point out that all Basel member countries have their own rollout timelines and national discretion issues, not just the United States--which is entirely appropriate. In order to assist institutions in resolving their cross-border challenges, we are eager to hear specifics from institutions so that we can develop targeted solutions. Conclusion Mr. Chairman, in my remarks today I have described the Federal Reserve's views on suggested changes to the current regulatory risk-based capital regime, namely the proposals for Basel II and amended Basel I. I have outlined the need for change, the work completed to date, and some of the lessons learned. In our view, recent exercises such as QIS4 have served as useful indicators of the progress being made and the direction needed for these initiatives on regulatory capital requirements. QIS4 was part of an extended series of activities to ensure that the suggested regulatory capital revisions are implemented in an appropriate and prudent manner. From the Federal Reserve's perspective, we should continue to move forward with the activities I described, while seeking comment and listening to feedback at every stage. Our support for Basel II stems from the belief that it would provide a much better measure of minimum regulatory capital at the largest, most complex institutions, aligning capital with risks to which these institutions are exposed. We also believe that Basel II would bring about substantial improvements in risk management to those institutions. At the same time, amending Basel I for the vast majority of banking institutions in the United States could improve the reflection of risks in Basel I-based rules without much additional burden. Taken together, these initiatives should ensure adequate minimum capital cushions, allow fair competition, maintain safety and soundness, and enhance financial stability. I am pleased to answer your questions.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced its approval of the application under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act by Sky Financial Group, Inc., Bowling Green, to acquire Falls Bank, Stow, all of Ohio. Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action.

Testimony of Ben S. Bernanke Nomination hearing Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate November 15, 2005 Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and Members of the Committee, I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today and for the expeditious scheduling of this hearing. I would also like to express my gratitude to President Bush for nominating me to be a Member and Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. If I am confirmed, I will work to the utmost of my abilities to fulfill the important responsibilities of this office. I recently testified before this Committee in my capacity as Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Today, however, I appear before this Committee in a different capacity, as the President's nominee to lead the Federal Reserve System. In this prospective new role, I would bear the critical responsibility of preserving the independent and nonpartisan status of the Federal Reserve--a status that, in my view, is essential to that institution's ability to function effectively and achieve its mandated objectives. I assure this Committee that, if I am confirmed, I will be strictly independent of all political influences and will be guided solely by the Federal Reserve's mandate from Congress and by the public interest. With respect to monetary policy, I will make continuity with the policies and policy strategies of the Greenspan Fed a top priority. Several aspects of the policy strategy that has evolved under Chairman Greenspan, and Chairman Volcker before him, deserve special note. First, central bankers in the United States and around the world have come to understand that ensuring long-run price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and overall economic stability. In recent decades, the variability of output and employment has decreased markedly, and recessions have been less frequent and less severe. I believe that the Federal Reserve's success in reducing and stabilizing inflation and inflation expectations is a major reason for this improved economic performance. If I am confirmed, I am confident that my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I will maintain the focus on long-term price stability as monetary policy's greatest contribution to general economic prosperity and maximum employment. Second, monetary policy at the Fed has been executed with both careful judgment and flexibility. To cite one prominent example, Chairman Greenspan's risk-management policy approach attempts to take into account the possible consequences of not only the most likely forecast outcomes but also of a range of lower-probability outcomes. Implementing this approach requires sophisticated judgments about possible risks to the economy as well as the flexibility to respond quickly to new information or unexpected developments. Risk analysis of this type is a necessary component of successful monetary policymaking. To be sure, the need for flexibility does not imply that good policy is undisciplined, as Chairman Greenspan himself has emphasized. Monetary policy is most effective when it is as coherent, consistent, and predictable as possible, while at all times leaving full scope for flexibility and the use of judgment as conditions may require. Finally, under Chairman Greenspan, monetary policy has become increasingly transparent to the public and the financial markets, a trend that I strongly support. A more transparent policy process increases democratic accountability, promotes constructive dialogue between policymakers and informed outsiders, reduces uncertainty in financial markets, and helps to anchor the public's expectations of long-run inflation--which, as I have argued already, promotes economic growth and stability. One possible step toward greater transparency would be for the FOMC to state explicitly the numerical inflation rate or range of inflation rates it considers to be consistent with the goal of long-term price stability, a practice currently employed by many of the world's central banks. I have supported this idea in my academic writings and in speeches as a Board member. Providing quantitative guidance about the meaning of "long-term price stability" could have several advantages, including further reducing public uncertainty about monetary policy and anchoring long-term inflation expectations even more effectively. I view the explicit statement of a long-run inflation objective as fully consistent with the Federal Reserve's current policy approach, including its appropriate emphasis on the role of judgment and flexibility in policymaking. Most important, this step would in no way reduce the importance of maximum employment as a policy goal. Indeed, a key justification for this action is its potential to contribute to stronger and more stable employment growth by further stabilizing inflation and inflation expectations. In any case, I assure this Committee that, if I am confirmed, I will take no precipitate steps in the direction of quantifying the definition of long-run price stability. This matter requires further study at the Federal Reserve as well as extensive discussion and consultation. I would propose further action only if a consensus can be developed that taking such a step would further enhance the ability of the FOMC to satisfy its dual mandate of achieving both stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. My comments so far today have focused on monetary policy. Of course, the Federal Reserve's responsibilities extend well beyond this area. Since its founding, the Federal Reserve has been given substantial responsibility for protecting the stability of the nation's financial system, which is a precondition for stability of the broader economy. For example, the Fed works closely with other regulators to ensure the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system, and over the years it has played a constructive role in managing and mitigating diverse types of financial crises. If I am confirmed, I will work to enhance the stability of the financial system and to ensure that the resources, procedures, and expertise are in place as needed to respond to any threats to stability that may emerge. The Federal Reserve, along with other regulators, is also engaged in trying to ensure that consumers are treated fairly in their financial dealings: that their privacy is protected, that they receive clear and understandable information about the terms of financial agreements, and that they are not subject to discriminatory or abusive lending practices. The Fed also enhances consumer welfare through programs to promote financial literacy and community economic development. These are important responsibilities and, if I am confirmed, I will give them my close attention and active support. I have emphasized this morning the importance of intellectual continuity in policymaking. A more fundamental source of continuity, however, is the superb staff and leadership of the Federal Reserve System. If I am confirmed, I will have the privilege of drawing on the great strengths of this institution to ensure a continuity of the policy process that transcends any single person. I very much look forward to this opportunity. Let me conclude by offering special thanks to Chairman Greenspan for his collegiality and support when I served on the Board of Governors and for his exemplary leadership of the Federal Reserve System. One may aspire to succeed Chairman Greenspan but it will not be possible to replace him. Thank you. I would be happy to take your questions.
Remarks by Governor Mark W. Olson At the First EU/U.S. Retail Banking Forum Conference, Brussels, Belgium November 15, 2005 Perspectives on the Development of a Unified National Payments System in the United States Introduction Good morning. I would like to thank the World Savings Banks Institute, as well as the European Savings Banks Group, for the invitation to address this distinguished audience. I appreciate the opportunity to share some thoughts on the development of a unified national payments system in the United States. I am looking forward to Ms. Tumpel-Gugerell's remarks on the euro system's perspective, and I anticipate a lively panel discussion will follow. The European Union and the United States have had very different experiences with the origin and evolution of their payments systems. There is a great deal to learn by studying both systems and their ongoing changes. This morning, I would like to discuss the development of a unified national payments system, or single payments area, in the United States. I will sketch the foundations of the contemporary U.S. payments system and remark on the history of U.S. banking. I think you will recognize some parallels with, but also important differences from, the European Union experience. I will then discuss some of the challenges in the U.S. experience, as well as some thoughts on the future of the U.S. payments system. The overarching theme of my remarks is that the United States has evolved toward an increasingly unified national payments system, through both market-driven development and some specific public-sector actions. A Brief History of the U.S. Banking and Payments System From the late 1700s through the mid-1800s, the development of the U.S. banking system was dominated by roles played by individual states. Generally, commercial banks were not chartered by the federal government; rather, they were chartered, regulated, and supervised by the states and operated under different state legal and regulatory frameworks. The explicit delegation of bank supervision to the states reflected the strong preference for decentralized authority and resulted in the first brief efforts to establish a national bank. In 1791, the federal government chartered the First Bank of the United States with a twenty-year charter, its first attempt to establish a central bank. After that charter lapsed in 1811, the federal government in 1816 made a second attempt to form a central bank, by establishing the Second Bank of the United States. That twenty-year charter was also allowed to lapse amid the economic and political controversies of that time. In ensuing years, the banking system was highly decentralized with individual state-chartered commercial banks issuing their own bank notes. Although there has been an academic debate about the success of this period of competitive, private-bank note issuance, the federal government ultimately acted to address significant problems posed by this banking structure. In the payments system, for example, state bank notes were subject to devaluation in response to credit risk and to counterfeiting, creating a significant burden on local and interstate commerce. In 1863 and 1865, the National Bank Acts permitted the federal government to charter national banks and allowed these banks to issue national bank notes backed by federal bonds. The collateralization of national bank notes with U.S. government bonds, along with a 10 percent tax on state notes, expedited the acceptance of national bank notes and quickly eliminated state notes from circulation. In addition, the United States Treasury also began directly issuing notes backed by gold in the 1870s. These developments were important first steps in unifying the national payments system. In retrospect, the overall fragmentation of the U.S. banking system helped produce a fragmented national retail payments system, including a fragmented check-clearing system. Checks, which were traditionally cleared through local private clearing houses or correspondent banks, were the predominant alternative to making payments with bank notes or gold. However, checks were not paid at par. That is, checks cleared between banks in different states or locales were discounted based on the costs of transportation needed to collect the checks, the risk profiles of the banks on which the checks were drawn, and the need to earn a return on clearing activities. Neither the consumer nor the merchant knew how much of the value of a check would ultimately be delivered to the intended beneficiary, so it was difficult to determine the value of a check needed to pay a bill. As the level of interstate commerce grew, the costs associated with this inefficient practice became quite burdensome. Also, collecting a check could take a long time. Because a check could be forwarded to numerous correspondent banks before ultimately being presented for payment, some public officials charged that banks deliberately engaged in the “circuitous routing” of checks to exploit the inefficiencies of the payments system. The risks and inefficiencies in the fragmented banking system also resulted in bank panics, which were relatively common, and made it difficult to transfer liquidity from one region of the country to another. In 1913, the U.S. Congress established the Federal Reserve System, not only to provide greater financial stability and to improve banking supervision, but also to provide an elastic currency and a national check-clearing system. The Federal Reserve began issuing currency in 1914. Moreover, checks that were cleared through the Federal Reserve and that were drawn on Federal Reserve member banks were exchanged at par value. In the early days, the Federal Reserve's national check-clearing service was provided free of charge to nationally chartered banks that were required to join the system and state-chartered banks that joined voluntarily. Despite some early difficulties with achieving widespread par clearing, the Federal Reserve's check collection services ultimately provided the nation with a much more unified payments system. During this period, checks or drafts were also used as a means of settling interbank payment obligations. To improve the safety and efficiency of the interbank settlement process, in 1918 the Federal Reserve developed and implemented Fedwire, the first real-time gross settlement system. The key feature of the Fedwire system was the ability to transfer account balances held at the central bank through telegraphic messages using a secure communications network. Although Fedwire was intended to improve the large-value payment system, and quickly accomplished that goal, it was also used for some urgent large-value commercial and retail payments, and continues to be used that way today. The payments operations of state and federally chartered private banks, private clearing houses, and the operations of the new central bank, provided the foundation for the private- and public-sector payments infrastructure that exists in the United States today. Yet for many years, policies that deterred interstate banking shaped the design and operation of the retail payments system. The U.S. banking and payments system has also been shaped by other important state and federal laws. Starting in the late 1800s, states attempted to develop a more-uniform set of commercial laws codifying existing laws and common business practices. They eventually adopted the Uniform Commercial Code, or UCC, which states generally enacted. At the federal level, a number of laws influenced the development of the banking system. Laws such as the McFadden Act and the Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act were passed to restrict either bank ownership or bank branching across state lines. Over the years, legislation enacted by the various states, and ultimately at the federal level, eliminated the barriers to banks operating across state lines, at least with respect to interstate bank acquisitions. In 1994, the Riegle-Neal Act, which repealed most of the federal prohibitions on interstate banking, set the foundation for establishing efficient, national retail banking and payment arrangements. If the U.S. banking structure is the foundation of the retail payments system, the cornerstone is the competitive market model for payment system operators. The Monetary Control Act of 1980, or MCA, codified the use of the competitive market model for the U.S. payments system with the central bank as a provider of services. Prior to that Act, only Federal Reserve member banks were permitted to use the Federal Reserve's (free) payment services. Nonmembers typically cleared checks through a network of upstream correspondent banks that were Federal Reserve members. The MCA confirmed the Federal Reserve's role as a key provider of services and required the Federal Reserve to provide payment services to both member and nonmember banks. Most importantly, the MCA required the Federal Reserve to price its payment services and to fully recover the costs of providing those services, including imputed taxes and profits. The purpose of this requirement was to avoid having the central bank underprice payment services in a way that would undercut the existence and growth of private-sector alternatives. The ultimate goal was to stimulate efficiency and innovation by encouraging competition between service providers and payment system operators, including the central bank. The legal framework governing payment systems has continued to evolve. In its role as catalyst for payments system improvements, the Federal Reserve has worked with the private sector to identify and address barriers to improvements in payments system efficiency. It then developed legislative recommendations that eventually became the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, known as Check 21. Check 21, which became effective in 2004, eliminated legal impediments to the use of electronic technologies to collect checks. Under Check 21, banks no longer need to physically move original paper checks from the bank where the checks are deposited to the bank that pays them. The law created a new negotiable instrument called a substitute check, which permitted banks to truncate original checks, to send digital check images across the country, and to deliver paper substitute checks to banks that wanted to continue receiving paper checks. As a result, checks will ultimately be collected faster and at lower cost through an electronic national clearing structure. Consumer Behavior and Market Response in the Future U.S. Payments System The development and adoption of new payments instruments is largely being influenced by consumers, merchants, and their banks and service providers interacting in a market setting. Until very recently, checks have been the dominant form of noncash payment in the U.S. payments system as measured by the annual number of payments. However, the 1990s saw a marked shift in consumers' behavior. Federal Reserve research has revealed a steady decline in check usage since the mid-1990s. By 2003, electronic noncash retail payments exceeded check payments for the first time. Debit cards, used primarily by consumers for everyday purchases, have represented the fastest growing segment of the retail payments system. They have been a natural bridge from cash and checks to electronics. Historically, automated teller machine and debit card networks, much like the early check-clearing network in the U.S., were generally regionally based. Banks issued debit cards that could be used only on certain networks, which had limited reach across state lines. This meant that, although early debit cards were a convenient new way to make noncash payments, the scope of their use was limited. Some networks developed interchange agreements to expand the acceptance of their debit cards. In addition, as debit cards evolved, the major credit card companies and their banks began to issue a new type of debit card that operated through the existing national credit card networks. The use of these so-called signature-based debit cards has been growing rapidly for several years. Another payment mechanism that was developed jointly by the private sector and the Federal Reserve was the automated clearinghouse, or ACH, system. The ACH system is a batch electronic payment system that has traditionally been used to process recurring credit and debit transactions, such as payroll payments, mortgage and utility payments, and government benefits. In its infancy, the ACH system was a segmented regional system that has since evolved into a nationwide payments system. More recently, banks have used the ACH system in innovative ways to make nonrecurring payments, such as payments over the telephone or Internet, which were typically made by credit or debit card. In addition, businesses that receive large numbers of checks from customers are obtaining their customers' permission to convert the checks into ACH payments. As a result, the ACH has exhibited significant growth in recent years and is contributing to the decline in the number of payments being processed as checks. It remains to be seen how significant an effect recently emerging instruments such as payroll cards, stored-value cards, or electronic benefits transfer instruments will have on the payments landscape. Whether or not these instruments are broadly accepted will depend largely on consumer and business preferences, and on how much of an improvement these instruments are over competing payment instruments. It is difficult to foresee how quickly and in what forms alternative payments will evolve in the U.S. economy. It is likely, however, that the evolution will continue to be market-driven. In conclusion, I want to emphasize that the national payments system of the United States has evolved through both private- and public-sector contributions. Both sectors have been involved in technological innovation and the development of payments infrastructure. In addition, the public sector has responded by addressing legal and other barriers that adversely affect the banking system. Together, private and public sectors have contributed to a more-efficient national payments system that facilitates greater commerce and innovation. Looking forward, market needs will ultimately shape the U.S. payments system and its direction. If the past is a guide, geography will continue to decline as an important factor in the national payments system just as it has in other areas of economic activity. Thank you.
Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For immediate release November 17, 2005 Agencies Finalize FACT Act Rules on Medical Information The federal bank, thrift, and credit union regulatory agencies today issued final rules under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) that create exceptions to the statutory prohibition against obtaining or using medical information in connection with credit eligibility determinations. The final rules, which are substantially identical to the interim final rules issued by the agencies in June 2005, also address the sharing of medically related information among affiliates. The effective date for these final rules is April 1, 2006. Section 411 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act) amended the FCRA to provide that a creditor may not obtain or use medical information in connection with any determination of a consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit, except as permitted by regulations. The FACT Act requires the agencies to prescribe regulations that permit creditors to obtain and use medical information for credit eligibility purposes when necessary and appropriate to protect legitimate operational, transactional, risk, consumer, and other needs. The proposed rules were published for comment on April 28, 2004 and interim final rules were adopted by the agencies on June 10, 2005. The final rules issued today permit creditors to obtain and use medical information that is typically considered in credit underwriting. Under the final rules, all creditors can rely upon the exceptions for obtaining and using medical information. Section 411 of the FACT Act also amended the FCRA to limit the ability of creditors and others to share medically related information among affiliates, except as permitted by the statute, regulation, or order. The final rules specify the circumstances in which certain creditors may share medically related information among affiliates without becoming consumer reporting agencies. The final rules are being issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision. The rules of each agency are substantively identical. The Federal Register notice is attached.

Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. (on November 8) To the Fourth Joint Central Bank Research Conference on Risk Management and Systemic Risk, Frankfurt, Germany (via videoconference) Financial Regulation: Seeking the Middle Way I am pleased to participate in the panel discussion at this Fourth Joint Central Bank Research Conference. As I will make clear, I think conferences of this sort, by contributing to our understanding of financial innovations, can play a critical role in policymakers' decisions. Financial innovations have been coming at a rapid pace in recent years; new financial products have been introduced and are expanding rapidly, and new institutions have taken on prominent roles in key financial markets. Financial technologies have improved as well and have the potential to contribute to the efficiency and resilience of financial markets. However, with new products and institutions comes the potential for new risks to financial stability. As a result, we policymakers are likely to be torn. On the one hand, we may want to encourage welfare-improving innovations by limiting the extent of regulation. On the other hand, because of possible systemic concerns, some policymakers may want to regulate innovative instruments and institutions even as they are developing. In my view, policymakers can best balance these goals by expending the effort needed to understand financial innovations as they emerge and by avoiding overregulation that may stifle valuable innovations. When I talk about financial innovations, I have in mind several types of developments. A far-reaching set of innovations--and the focus of this panel--is the development and increasing popularity of products for the transfer of credit risk. Prominent among such innovations are credit derivatives, asset-backed securities, and secondary-market trading of syndicated loans. Another important development has been the rapid growth of the hedge fund industry, about which we learned a lot this morning, and its expanded role in the financial system. On the retail side, we have seen a proliferation of new lending products in the United States, including home-equity lines of credit, interest-only and even negative-amortization mortgages, and subprime mortgages and consumer loans. Today, I will discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with new products and institutions and a middle way that regulators might pursue as these new products and institutions emerge. Benefits and Drawbacks Financial innovations hold the promise of improved efficiency and increased overall economic welfare. For example, new products and markets can open the door to new investment opportunities for a variety of market participants. And improved risk-measurement and risk-management technologies can contribute to an improved allocation of risk as risk is shifted to those more willing and able to bear it. Financial innovations also have the potential to boost financial stability. Risk-transfer mechanisms can not only better allocate risk but also reduce its concentration. Improved efficiencies and increased competition may result in substantially lower trading costs and may consequently improve liquidity in many markets. Better liquidity, which is instrumental to faster and more accurate price discovery and therefore to more-informative prices, can also be brought about by an increased presence of new institutions in new or existing markets. The entry of those new institutions into new markets can, so long as the institutions prove resilient, increase the availability of funds to borrowers in times of stress and may thus reduce the likelihood of credit crunches. Although financial innovations have the capacity to improve economic welfare overall, it is natural for policymakers to worry that innovations may have unexpected and undesirable side effects and may even represent new sources of systemic risk. For example, policymakers may be concerned about unexpected price dynamics or problems in infrastructure or operations. Market participants estimate how prices and investment flows are likely to behave for new instruments, but their understanding becomes more detailed and more accurate only as behavior under a variety of economic conditions is observed, and the development of that understanding obviously takes time. Under turbulent conditions, or when new information causes market participants to question their own investment strategies, their behavior may change rapidly, leading to rapid price changes that may seem outsized relative to changes in economic fundamentals. That was briefly the case recently in the market for synthetic collateralized debt obligations. Market participants did not anticipate the sharp decline in implied default correlations that followed the downgrades of Ford and General Motors debt. Prices moved quite a bit for a short time as portfolios were rebalanced, but spillovers to other markets were limited, and market volatility subsequently eased. Problems with the infrastructure or operations that support an innovation--including the underlying legal documentation and accounting--are also likely to be revealed only over time, as exemplified by the technical difficulties with restructuring clauses in credit default swaps that became apparent a few years ago. In that case, default events and related payoffs sometimes did not occur as expected, and so actual exposures differed from those investors had intended. The result was a change in the value of existing contracts and a period of market adjustment as new restructuring clauses were developed and implemented. Of course, we should not want to prevent rapid price changes or changes in investment flows, as such changes may be appropriate as new information about fundamentals emerges. And the occurrence of glitches in new markets and institutions need not reflect policy failures or provide evidence that an innovation is undesirable. Preventing all such occurrences would probably require us to stop all innovation. But neither is it desirable that growing pains in one market or at a few institutions spill over so strongly that the financial system as a whole could be destabilized. A Middle Way in Regulation Policymakers have a range of strategies available for dealing with innovation. At one extreme, in theory we could take a completely hands-off approach, allowing new financial markets and instruments to develop without restrictions and indeed without any scrutiny, trusting private market participants to do everything necessary for stability and efficiency. At the other extreme, policymakers theoretically might be quite heavy-handed, either imposing regulations on virtually every market and instrument to stop any innovations that, in their judgment, could cause harm or, conversely, actively fostering or subsidizing innovations seen as desirable. Obviously, these are extreme positions, and I do not know of any practicing policymaker who seriously wants to pursue either extreme course. Today I wish to argue for a middle ground in which markets are allowed to work and develop and in which policymakers work hard to understand new developments and to help market participants see the need for improvements where appropriate. In my view, regulations should be imposed only when market participants do not have the incentive or the capability to effectively manage the risks created by financial innovation. For example, explicit or implicit subsidies of some institutions could limit market discipline of their risk-taking, leading to a concentration of risk so large that even the most sophisticated institutions would find it next to impossible to manage the risk under stressful circumstances. Or policymakers may be concerned that some potential parties to innovative contracts, especially in the retail arena, are insufficiently knowledgeable to understand or manage the associated risks. I believe such instances are rare. Making a case for early regulatory intervention is particularly difficult when the private parties involved in an innovation are sophisticated because, in many cases, they will be the first to recognize possible problems and will have strong incentives to fix them and also to protect themselves against fraud or unfair dealing. So how should policymakers proceed down this middle path? First of all, we need to learn--we need to understand and evaluate the innovations that are taking place in financial markets. This process should include information sharing with other authorities, including those in other nations, in order to benefit from the experiences in other markets and regions. The resulting improved understanding is often enough to prepare policymakers to deal with any breakdowns that do occur and to avoid having the breakdowns turn into systemic problems. The U.S. response to the century date change is an example from a different context that fits into this category. In that case, policymakers worked hard to understand the complex practical issues and to share that knowledge with financial firms. Those firms independently evaluated the risks they faced and took appropriate action to manage them effectively. Improved understanding may also ease concerns about potential risks. For example, in light of the effects of financial consolidation on the number of firms acting as dealers in the market for dollar interest rate options, the Federal Reserve became concerned about possible risks to the functioning of that market. These concerns included questions about the adequacy of risk management at the remaining dealers and about the possible effects that problems at one of those dealers could have on its counterparties and market liquidity. However, further investigation by Federal Reserve staff suggested that market participants were generally managing their market and counterparty risks effectively and that those hedging risk in the options market would not unduly suffer from a temporary disruption in liquidity. Our wariness about concentration in this market has not disappeared as a result of our improved understanding, but it has diminished. In general, improved knowledge about financial innovations may prevent the imposition of unwarranted restrictions and is surely a precursor to intelligent regulation in the event it is warranted. A second step for policymakers walking the middle path should be to ensure that market participants have the proper incentives and the information they need to protect themselves from any problems related to new products, markets, or institutions; by so doing, policymakers can perhaps mitigate those problems. Policymakers should insist that regulated firms effectively manage the risks associated with new activities and markets, thereby fostering effective market discipline of risk-taking, including risk-taking by unregulated firms. Such an insistence generally does not require new regulation but rather is an application of existing regulation in a potentially new context. One of the lessons of the difficulties at Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was that the hedge fund had been able to achieve very high levels of leverage because some regulated counterparties had not appropriately managed their counterparty risk exposures. Subsequently, both banks and supervisors had to reassess what such management entailed. Clearly, supervisors should strongly encourage institutions to know their risk posture and to be able to control it and react appropriately as circumstances change. Policymakers should insist on similarly high risk-management standards for regulated financial institutions that provide retail products. As a case in point, bank supervisors in the United States recently issued guidance about the management of risks related to home-equity lines of credit. This guidance did not involve new regulation of these instruments but rather reminded institutions offering such products that they have an obligation to manage the resulting risks appropriately. A pervasive lack of awareness about the risks embedded in new financial products certainly increases the likelihood that users of those products may face difficulties and that those difficulties may become systemic. One way policymakers can help prevent this possibility from happening is by supporting increased transparency and disclosure. Although counterparties in wholesale markets should generally be expected to demand and obtain the information they need to evaluate their risks, policymakers can no doubt help establish high standards. In the case of retail transactions, support for efforts to foster the basic financial literacy of households is a useful complement to efforts to promote appropriate disclosure. The more consumers are equipped to interpret disclosures, the more effective those disclosures are likely to be. A third feature of the moderate approach I am trying to chart is an active dialogue between policymakers and market participants. In my view, policymakers should serve as a voice for the development of infrastructure and sensible standards and practices. Ideally such steps would be taken by market participants of their own volition, but sometimes informal interventions by policymakers can help foster cooperative efforts by market participants. For example, partly in reaction to the report of the second Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently hosted a meeting with representatives of major participants in the credit default swap market, as well as with their domestic and international supervisors, to discuss a range of issues, including market practices with regard to assignments of trades and operational issues associated with confirmation backlogs. The result was an industry commitment to take concrete steps to address issues of concern. A fourth dimension of my proposed middle path is the ongoing monitoring of key markets and institutions. Policymakers should be aware of any emerging stresses in the financial system, including those related to new instruments and institutions. Indeed, some central banks have created "financial stability" staff groups to oversee such monitoring and, in some cases, to publish regular financial stability reports. In the event that such monitoring suggests that the operations of some institutions or markets are under significant strain and, importantly, that the resulting pressures on businesses and households could have a material adverse effect on the real economy, the central bank may want to respond by adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Finally, financial innovations may on occasion warrant new regulations because financial institutions either cannot or will not manage the associated risks appropriately. Indeed, regulation should be seen as part of the broader "infrastructure" that supports both financial stability and innovation, and like other more traditional infrastructure, regulatory regimes have to keep up. For example, developments in financial markets and advances in the ability of banks to measure and manage their risks have increasingly made the existing capital regulation of the largest banks, the 1988 Basel Accord, look antiquated. Basel II is a more flexible framework than Basel I and is intended to better permit capital regulation to keep up with financial market innovations in the future. To conclude, I wish to emphasize that policymakers should have a bias toward trusting financial markets to manage the introduction of new products and the development of new institutions smoothly and without undue stress to the financial system. However, we cannot take such an outcome for granted: Financial firms may not consider the effects of their decisions on the stability of other firms or on the broader financial markets, and some may lack the incentives and ability to learn about and manage the risks induced by financial innovations. In such cases, policymakers may need to work with markets and their participants, and on occasion regulate them, to achieve the desired outcomes. However, policymakers should, wherever possible, avoid premature regulation that could stifle innovation. I would note that a significant number of substantial shocks to financial markets have occurred in recent years--including, for example, the difficulties at Long-Term Capital Management and the unexpected and massive fraud at some high-profile companies--and yet the broader effects on the real economy have ultimately been quite small. Our financial markets are flexible and resilient, and they can absorb shocks surprisingly well. As a result, most risks caused by new developments in financial markets should be manageable without heavy-handed regulation. This meeting is a good example of what my middle course suggests we should be doing: working hard to understand innovations and their possible implications. Alertness and knowledge on the part of policymakers would go a long way toward ensuring that our positive recent track record will carry on amid what I am sure will continue to be a rapidly changing financial landscape.

Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies At the Standard & Poors North American Financial Institutions Conference, New York, New York November 30, 2005 Recent Developments in Regulatory Capital I would like to thank Standard and Poors for the invitation to speak here today. As I look at the topics on the agenda, I am struck by how similar the regulatory capital framework is to the corporate and bond rating approaches to capital that you are discussing. In fact, one of the continuing challenges financial officers face is relating the different levels of capital that regulators and business strategy require. Regulators focus on improving measures of risk exposures to determine minimum regulatory capital. That is, we are focused on setting a level of capital at individual banks that is sufficient for safety and soundness in the financial system. Successful individual financial institutions, on the other hand, generally strive for a higher level of capital to effectively implement their strategies. This higher level of capital demonstrates financial strength to the market, which is reflected in their credit ratings and allows them to access funding and capital at attractive interest rates. The higher capital level also supports business strategies by helping firms to retain and grow their customer base, and by providing a capital cushion that allows them to respond to new business opportunities on a timely basis. Conferences such as this help us to share evolving best practices in determining appropriate target capital levels from these different perspectives. It is the continuing focus of relating capital to risk measurement and modeling, including the wider scope of risk types that can be measured, that provides a common framework to relate economic, market, and minimum regulatory capital. Recent Developments in Regulatory Capital In my remarks today, I am going to focus on minimum regulatory capital. As you likely know, the past two months have been somewhat eventful in the arena of regulatory capital rules, which normally does not move at the speed of light. First, on September 30, the U.S. banking agencies announced their revised plans for moving forward with Basel II, which in the United States is expected to apply to only a small set of large, internationally active organizations. Second, the U.S. banking agencies decided to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to revise our existing risk-based capital standards, known as Basel I, which would apply to the vast majority of U.S. institutions. We hope that the next few months will be a period of interaction and discussion with the industry and others, as we hear comments on the ANPR for Basel I and issue the first full U.S. proposal for Basel II. To some, the long period of deliberation has been frustrating, and we do understand that. But we must all remember that changes of this magnitude take substantial time to complete, especially because we are striving to be as transparent as possible about the interagency process and the resulting proposals. In evaluating the potential impact, we are taking substantial time to listen to industry and other public comments, and working diligently to make our proposals better in response to those comments. Given the broad objective of enhancing safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system, we consider the work on both the ANPR for Basel I-based rules and the Basel II framework to be well worth it. Proposals to Revise Basel I As I noted, the ANPR for revisions to Basel I-based rules is now in the public domain. It is not my objective here to describe the ANPR in detail, but I would like to highlight a few key points. To start, we should acknowledge that our current risk-based capital rules, issued in 1989, have provided a reasonably effective measure of regulatory capital over the years. Not surprisingly, they also need updating from time to time. Accordingly, some proposals in this ANPR address areas that have been outstanding for a while, such as assessing a capital charge on short-term commitments. Other portions of the ANPR are directed specifically at possible competitive implications of Basel II implementation in the United States, such as altering the risk-weight for residential mortgage exposures. The rules proposed for revision in the ANPR, which would still apply to the vast majority of institutions in the United States, would be more reflective of risk-taking while still remaining relatively simple. Conversely, we are proposing that the more complex Basel II capital rules would be required only for a small set of large, complex organizations--although any institution that can qualify could choose to operate under the Basel II rules. In brief, the ANPR for Basel I-based rules proposes and seeks comments on changes in the following areas: use of external credit ratings and other measures of credit risk; expanded number of risk weight categories for credit exposures; qualifying collateral and guarantees; credit conversion factors for commitments; past due exposures; commercial real estate exposures; residential mortgage risk weights; retail and small business exposures; and securitizations with early amortization provisions. In issuing the ANPR, an advance notice, the agencies are indicating that views are still being developed and additional comment would be beneficial before we move forward. We are intentionally leaving a number of areas open in order to solicit a broad range of comments. Indeed, we are strongly encouraging bankers and others to provide their views, especially since the suggested changes could affect nearly all of the banks in the United States. Importantly, the ANPR does not propose changes to the existing U.S. prompt corrective action or leverage requirements; nor does it suggest the addition of new risk-based charges for operational risk or for interest rate risk, which would continue to be covered implicitly. As supervisors, we continue to focus on ensuring that risk-management processes are appropriate and effective for the operations of each institution. The ANPR reflects our attempt to mitigate some of the consequences arising from differences between Basel I and Basel II, while acknowledging that simpler capital rules are still appropriate for nearly all U.S. banking organizations. To be quite clear, the Federal Reserve will not look upon institutions as having deficient risk-management systems simply because they choose to stay under the Basel I capital framework. Thus, we expect that non-Basel II banks can continue to have CAMELS 1 and 2 ratings as long as they operate in a safe and sound manner. The Basel II Framework Rationale for Adopting Basel II in the United States In discussing Basel II, I would like to begin by briefly outlining our reasons for adopting the new framework. Over the past several decades, we have witnessed substantial changes in the U.S. banking industry, particularly at our largest institutions. These very large entities have broad geographic reach, operate in many lines of business, and offer a wide array of complex products and services. The largest institutions have moved away from the traditional banking strategy of holding assets on the balance sheet to strategies that emphasize redistribution of assets and active management of risks. And the risk-management techniques employed by many banking organizations continue to change, improve and adapt to the ever-changing financial landscape. While the current Basel I-based rules have served us well for nearly two decades, they are simply not appropriate for identifying and measuring the risks of our largest, most complex banking organizations. Basel I, even when periodically amended, must be straightforward enough for even the smallest banking organizations to implement with relative ease. Thus, the categories of risk used to determine capital are very broad and are intended to capture the average risk levels across the banking system for that generic exposure. Basel I, which has primarily a balance-sheet focus and simple methodology for including off balance-sheet exposures, may be appropriate for most banking organizations. But Basel I is not adequate for the largest, most complex organizations, which have significant, complicated exposures off the books that need to be considered more explicitly in determining minimum regulatory capital. Among these are operational risks, which in some recent instances have been the source of substantial losses far exceeding credit- or market-related ones. The Basel II framework, particularly the advanced approaches for credit and operational risk that we are proposing in the United States, is structured to be much more risk-sensitive than its predecessor. For example, all commercial loans are not lumped into one risk bucket but are differentiated according to certain risk inputs provided by institutions internal systems. On the operational risk side, the application of Basel II in the United States is intended to create better identification of those risk exposures and have them appropriately supported by regulatory capital. Furthermore, Basel IIs advanced approaches create a link between regulatory capital and risk management. Under these approaches, banks will be required to adopt more formal, quantitative risk-measurement and risk-management procedures and processes. The new Accords emphasis on improved risk management should not be interpreted solely as a requirement to determine regulatory capital standards, but rather as a foundation for risk-management practices that will strengthen the value of the banking franchise. But while the new framework would, in our view, provide useful incentives for institutions to accelerate the improvement of risk management in a broad sense, we believe that in most areas of risk management institutions would continue to have the choice among which specific methods they employ. Analysis of Recent Basel II Data As I said, supervisors in the United States take implementation of the Basel II framework very seriously. Indeed, throughout the process we have been especially attentive to the range of potential effects of Basel II implementation in the United States. You are most likely aware that during the summer the U.S. agencies conducted additional analysis of the initial results from the fourth Quantitative Impact Study--known as QIS4. The agencies were concerned that the results from QIS4 showed a wider dispersion and a larger overall drop in regulatory capital requirements for the QIS4 population of banks than the agencies had initially expected. The interagency analysis relating to QIS4 is essentially complete. Based on the new knowledge gained from this additional analysis, the U.S. agencies collectively decided to move ahead with our next proposal but adjust the plan for U.S. implementation of Basel II--as announced in our joint news release on September 30. Among a number of adjustments, we indicated our intention to extend the timeline for implementation and augment the transitional floors, which should provide bankers and regulators with more experience with Basel II before it is fully implemented in the United States. In terms of the specifics of the QIS4 analysis, we learned that the drop in QIS4 capital was largely due to the favorable point in the business cycle when the data were collected. While the previous QIS3 exercise was conducted with data from 2002, a higher credit loss year, QIS4 reflected the more benign credit conditions present in 2004. We learned that the dispersion among institutions was largely due to the varying risk parameters they used, permissible in the QIS4 exercise, and also due to portfolio differences. That is, banks have different approaches to risk-management processes, and their models and databases reflect those differences. Importantly, we also learned that some of the data submitted by individual institutions was not complete; in some cases banks did not have estimates of loss in stress periods or used ad hoc estimates, which might have caused minimum regulatory capital to be underestimated. Based on the results of QIS4, the Federal Reserve recognizes that all institutions have additional work to do. In our view, the findings did not point to insurmountable problems, but instead identified areas for future supervisory focus. In that way, the QIS4 analysis was critical in enabling us to move forward. We were also pleased to see that general progress is being made toward developing more risk-sensitive capital measures. As most of you know, the plans for U.S. implementation include a year of parallel run--a period in which minimum regulatory capital measures for Basel II will be calculated parallel to the existing Basel I measures--as well as three years of transitional floors. The agencies expect to perform additional in-depth analyses of the Basel II minimum capital calculations produced by institutions during the parallel-run and transitional-floor periods before we move to full implementation without floors. We want to ensure that the minimum regulatory capital levels for each institution and in the aggregate for the group of Basel II banks provide an adequate capital cushion consistent with safety and soundness. It is also helpful to remember that the QIS4 exercise was conducted on a best-efforts basis without close supervisory oversight. It was just one step in a progression of events leading to adoption of the Basel II framework. It is certainly the case that as we move closer to implementation, supervisory oversight of the Basel II implementation methodologies by our examination teams would increase. Indeed, during the qualification process, we expect to have several additional opportunities to evaluate institutions risk-management processes, models, and estimates--and provide feedback to the institutions on their progress. So while the QIS4 results clearly provided a much better sense than before of the progress in implementing Basel II and offered additional insights about the link between risks and capital, QIS4 should not be considered a complete forecast of Basel IIs ultimate effects. It was a point-in-time look at how the U.S. implementation was progressing. Trading Book Risks In discussions about Basel II, not as much attention has been given to the addendum issued earlier this year by the Basel Committee, which includes rules to strengthen the capital regime for banks trading activities. The existing capital regime for trading activities was formulated in 1996 and set forth an internal value at risk (or VaR) approach for measuring trading exposures. It was recognized at the time that VaR models may not adequately capture certain risks, or may not accurately account for so-called fat tails. For that reason, supervisors subjected banks VaR results to a multiplier to arrive at a more substantial capital charge. During the past decade, a number of changes have taken place in the composition of banks trading books that have led supervisors to question whether the 1996 capital regime remains appropriate. Trading books today include many more credit-related products, as well as other structured and exotic products, that are far less liquid than the products for which the 1996 regime was designed. These new products also give rise to new types of risk that the capital regime did not contemplate or capture. Moreover, supervisors were concerned that this increase in credit and liquidity risk in the trading book would accelerate as accounting standards move more and more to the use of fair value and as Basel II removes the eight-percent cap on banking book regulatory capital charges, giving banks an incentive to move their highest risk banking book positions to the trading book. To address these issues, the June 2005 Basel paper set forth a number of improvements to the trading book regulatory capital regime including: a requirement that banks have policies and procedures for determining which positions can be included in the trading book for regulatory capital purposes; stronger requirements for prudent valuation methods for trading book positions; an incremental charge for default risk not captured in the VaR-based calculation; more explicit and robust modeling standards for capturing specific risk; and a requirement that banks incorporate stress testing into their Pillar 2 internal capital requirement. Moving Forward with Basel II and Revisions to Basel I As I noted, we encourage a healthy debate about the agencies proposals--including the recently revised timeline for Basel II. We look forward to engaging the industry, the Congress, fellow supervisors, and others in a discussion about what effects the Basel II framework and the Basel I revisions might mean for our banking system. The proposals are intended to provide the right incentives for bankers, but if those do not appear correct, we want to know. We recognize the benefit of hearing many views and we realize that vigorous discussion and debate produce a much better product. The agencies also recognize that clear communications from the regulators can assist institutions in making preparations and thereby enhance the chances for success. Accordingly, we intend to publish a full set of proposed U.S. Basel II supervisory guidance to accompany the next rulemaking proposal, so that all possible information is made available. When it comes to Basel II, we recognize that certain details relating to internal bank systems and processes will depend on what the final U.S. rule and guidance contain. Accordingly, we are available to discuss implementation efforts with bankers at any time, and we want to hear specifics about which elements of the proposal they think will demand the greatest investments or generate the greatest uncertainty. We certainly hope that many upgrades made for Basel II are those that banking organizations would make anyway. And we are equally eager to hear whether the ANPR contains elements that would add burden in the calculation of regulatory capital for non-Basel II banks. With that information, the agencies can then determine where best to target resources to assist institutions in the transition process. Competitiveness Concerns To address the uncertainty of moving ahead with these two regulatory capital initiatives, we expect to remain vigilant about potentially unintended and undesired consequences that might have competitive effects on a certain class of banks or specific product lines. In that vein, the Federal Reserve has published several white papers analyzing the potential impact of Basel II on specific aspects of banking, such as small-business lending, mortgage lending, and mergers and acquisitions. A paper on credit cards is expected before year-end. While the conclusions of the papers published so far do not point to broad disruptions in existing banking markets as a result of Basel II, we do acknowledge that, absent adjustments, certain participants in these markets could be affected--especially in the small-business and residential-mortgage credit markets. We are also looking carefully at the potential impact of amendments in the ANPR for Basel I-based rules. It is our intention to gather as much information as possible about the impact of the suggested regulatory capital proposals on these markets, and make any necessary adjustments. The agencies naturally understand that institutions not likely to adopt Basel II are among those most wary of the potential competitive effects; in drafting the ANPR for revising Basel I, the agencies have taken these concerns into account. Conclusion In discussing the latest U.S. regulatory capital proposals, I have endeavored to describe where we are in the process, what we are trying to achieve, and how feedback from industry participants like you is vitally important. We at the Federal Reserve are pleased that both the process to implement Basel II as well as the process to revise the agencies Basel I-based capital rules are moving along. In our view, these represent important and necessary efforts to update our minimum regulatory capital requirements to keep them in line with changes in the banking industry over the past two decades. The need for Basel II reflects the increased sophistication of risk-management practices and the ways they can be applied to the measurement of capital. At the same time, it also reflects the increased complexity of banking in general, especially at larger institutions. The new framework should improve supervisors' ability to understand and monitor the risk taking and capital adequacy of large complex banks, thereby allowing regulators to address emerging problems sooner. It should also enable market participants to better evaluate the risk positions at those institutions. We are taking a somewhat conservative approach to implementing Basel II to ensure that it is implemented correctly and that we understand its potential ramifications. The ANPR for Basel I-based rules is also important and necessary. It should make the current regulatory capital rules more risk sensitive and address issues relating to competitive inequality--without adding much in the way of regulatory burden. We eagerly await comments on the ANPR to see if, in the eyes of bankers and others, we have come close to meeting our objectives. As we move forward on both proposals, we continue to pay attention to the overall level of capital as well as the potential dispersion of results among institutions. As prudent supervisors, we need to ensure that there is always enough capital in the banking system--whether banks operate under our current rules, revisions to our current rules, or Basel II. Furthermore, in discussing both Basel II and revisions to Basel I-based rules, we continue our support for prompt corrective action and leverage requirements. We expect the two regulatory capital initiatives discussed today, in complementing the existing regulatory capital regime, would substantially enhance the safety and soundness of the entire U.S. banking system.
