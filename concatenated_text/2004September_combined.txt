Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System National Credit Union Administration Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For Immediate Release September 8, 2004 Federal Bank, Thrift and Credit Union Regulatory Agencies Provide Brochure with Information on Internet "Phishing" The federal bank, thrift and credit union agencies today announced the publication of a with information to help consumers identify and combat a new type of Internet scam known as "phishing." The term is a play on the word "fishing," and that's exactly what Internet thieves are doing--fishing for confidential financial information, such as account numbers and passwords. With enough information, a con artist can run up bills on another person's credit card or, in the worst case, even steal that person's identity. In a common type of phishing scam, individuals receive e-mails that appear to come from their financial institution. The e-mail may look authentic, right down to the use of the institution's logo and marketing slogans. The e-mails often describe a situation that requires immediate attention and then warn that the account will be terminated unless the e-mail recipients verify their account information immediately by clicking on a provided link. The link will take the e-mail recipient to a screen that asks for account information. While it may appear to be a page sponsored by a legitimate financial institution, the information will actually go to the con artist who sent the e-mail. The federal financial regulatory agencies want consumers to know that they should never respond to such requests. No legitimate financial institution will ever ask its customers to verify their account information online. The brochure also advises consumers: Never click on the link provided in an e-mail if there is reason to believe it is fraudulent. The link may contain a virus. Do not be intimidated by e-mails that warn of dire consequences for not following their instructions. If there is a question about whether the e-mail is legitimate, go to the company's site by typing in a site address that you know to be legitimate. If you fall victim to a phishing scam, act immediately to protect yourself by alerting your financial institution, placing fraud alerts on your credit files and monitoring your account statements closely. Report suspicious e-mails or calls to the Federal Trade Commission through the Internet at , or by calling 1-877-IDTHEFT. The interagency brochure is available on each agency's web site and financial institutions are encouraged to download the camera-ready file for use in their own customer-education programs.

Remarks by Governor Edward M. Gramlich At the 30th anniversary of the Neighborhood Housing Services of America, Washington, D.C September 10, 2004 Introductory Remarks First of all, congratulations to Neighborhood Housing Services of America (NHSA), to the NeighborWorksÂ® organizations honored here today, and to the seven neighborhood pioneers. Helping people fight for their communities--helping to lift them up and keep them strong--is the core mission of the NeighborWorks System, which now consists of over 230 NeighborWorks organizations, NHSA, and the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC). We recently celebrated the 25 th anniversary of NRC, and today we celebrate the 30 th anniversary of its partner, NHSA. Over this period, these organizations have together created millions of new homeowners, helping to bring American homeownership rates to record highs. Statistical analysis shows the value of these efforts, proving time and again that people who have a stake in the place where they live fight to keep it a good place to live. These new homeowners also build wealth and participate in other aspects of the American dream. But while homeownership rates are at a record high, many individuals and families are still left out. The consistent barrier is the need for down-payment assistance. In the past, NeighborWorks organizations have tried to provide down-payment assistance, but without much help from capital markets in general. The network has been able to provide its support because of the efforts of local communities, NRC, and NHSA's social investors. I currently serve as chairman of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation's board. We at NRC and NHSA have been working to increase our effectiveness by opening up capital markets for the nonconventional down-payment loans that are made by NeighborWorks organizations. We believe that an open-ended source of funds for down-payment assistance loans will energize local organizations to promote homeownership in ways they otherwise could not. Today I am delighted to announce that Neighborhood Reinvestment, NHSA, and Fannie Mae have made significant progress toward developing a stable and predictable outlet source of these loans--the most difficult component of lower-income housing. We partners are collaborating on a pilot program in which Fannie Mae agrees to purchase for its own portfolio second-mortgage loans created to provide low-income borrowers with down-payment assistance. This initial pilot will be executed via a cash sale. The expectation is that NeighborWorks Network's demonstration of its ability to manage the program will eventually lead to the development of broader stand-alone mortgage-backed securities, making such loans effectively financed by capital markets at large. This forward-looking pilot, operated in cooperation with the Ventura County, California Community Development Corporation, combines the strength of Fannie Mae and its access to capital markets with NRC's and NHSA's experience and track record of serving the homeownership needs of low- and moderate-income families. But I see this project as just the beginning of a larger design, one that reflects the ever-growing and ever-changing nature of housing financial markets. In a collaborative effort involving public and private institutions, many of us in this room are crafting a different but, we hope, an extremely effective way for low-income people to participate in homeownership. This approach would extend the conversion of the obligations of low-income borrowers into acceptable capital market instruments. If we could provide loans to low-income homeowners through capital markets, we could solidify the gains we have been making in homeownership financing over the last thirty years. I would like to thank Fannie Mae, Neighborhood Reinvestment, NHSA, and the local NeighborWorks organizations for their commitment to addressing the issues of affordable housing. I would also like to thank the handful of committed investors who have supported NHSA for the past thirty years. We could not have achieved what we have without your support. We recognize that through our work, we all have a role to play--an obligation to help families realize their dreams of homeownership.

Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For Immediate Release September 15, 2004 Data Show Major Improvement in Credit Quality, Decreasing Volume of Loan Commitments WASHINGTON--The quality of large syndicated bank loans showed marked improvement this year, according to the Shared National Credit (SNC) review released today by federal bank and thrift regulators. Adversely rated loans continue to subside, although certain industries continue to have a high concentration of adversely rated loans. The results -- reported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision -- are based on analyses prepared in the second quarter of 2004 and reflect business and economic conditions at that time. Total loan commitments classified as either substandard, doubtful or loss fell by $78.2 billion, or 51 percent, from the previous year, compared with a net decrease of $4.9 billion, or 3 percent, the year before. Commitments rated special mention decreased by $22.4 billion, or 41 percent, in contrast to 2003 when they fell by $23.8 billion, or 30 percent. None of these figures includes the effects of hedging or other techniques that organizations often employ to mitigate risk. The ratio of classified loan commitments to total commitments fell to 4.8 percent, the lowest level since 2000, as industry charge-off trends and demand in the secondary market for lower quality assets removed many of the weakest loans from the banking system. Total adversely rated credits (classified and special mention combined) also fell considerably, to 6.9 percent of total commitments (see Chart 1 below). Adversely rated credits (also known as criticized credits) are the total of loans classified substandard, doubtful, and loss--and loans rated special mention. Classified credits are only those rated substandard, doubtful, and loss. Under the agencies' Uniform Loan Classification Standards, classified loans have well-defined weaknesses, including default in some cases. Special mention loans exhibit potential weaknesses, which may result in further deterioration if left uncorrected. Overview In aggregate, the 2004 SNC Program covered 7,490 credits totaling $1.5 trillion in loan commitments to 4,746 borrowers. Total commitments were down by 6 percent from the prior year and down 25 percent from the 2001 peak of $2.0 trillion. This is consistent with market data pointing to lower customer demand, tighter underwriting standards, and attractive capital market financing alternatives. Total outstandings, or drawn amounts, were down 17 percent from the prior year to $500 billion. For the 2004 review, total loan commitments classified as substandard fell $57 billion, or 51 percent from the prior year, while doubtful credits dropped by $16.8 billion or 57 percent (see Table 1 below). Commitments classified as loss fell $4.3 billion, down 40 percent from the prior year. Doubtful and loss amounts reflect the continued downward migration of credits with previously identified weakness. While total classified commitments fell sharply, the portion of outstanding nonaccrual classified loans fell at a slower rate (41 percent) to $30.1 billion. Table 1 SNC Classifications ($ billions) Total Commitments % Change 2003 - 2004 2004 2003 2002 2001 Substandard -51% 55.1 112.2 112.0 86.9 Doubtful -57% 12.5 29.3 26.0 22.6 Loss -40% 6.4 10.7 19.1 7.8 Total Classified -51% 74.0 152.2 157.1 117.3 Percent of Commitments 4.8% 9.3% 8.4% 5.7% Memo: Nonaccrual classified -41% 30.1 51.0 51.0 N/A Special Mention -41% 32.8 55.2 79.0 75.5 Total Criticized -48% 106.8 207.4 236.1 192.8 Percent of Commitments 6.9% 12.6% 12.6% 9.4% Total SNC Commitments -6% 1,545 1,644 1,871 2,050 Industry Trends The quality of the SNC portfolio improved markedly in all industries (see Appendix B). The strongest improvement occurred in the Manufacturing sector, with a $23 billion, or 54 percent, decline in classified commitments. Classified credits in the Oil, Gas, Pipelines and Utilities segment fell $13.9 billion, but remained at significantly elevated levels, with 13.8 percent of commitments classified. The Telecommunications and Cable segment also exhibited improvement, although exposure to previously identified weaknesses still linger. Well-documented problems facing airlines continue to drive classifications in the Lodging and Transportation segment. Other segments such as Financial Services and Insurance and Construction and Real Estate showed modest classification rates that were below those for the entire SNC program. Credits identified for special mention fell by $22.4 billion with strong declines experienced in every industry except Telecommunications and Cable. These declines were driven by a migration of a portion of prior year special mention credits to classified categories, as well as a decline in newly identified credits with potential weaknesses. Of total losses in 2004, $3.6 billion, or 56 percent, were directly attributable to the weakened Energy sector, most of which is related to outcomes of bankruptcy filings. The remaining losses were spread widely across a variety of industries. Trends by Entity Type During 2004, the share of SNC commitments held by U.S. banks and nonbank entities each edged up 1 percentage point to 46 percent and 12 percent, respectively. The share held by foreign banking organizations (FBOs) continued to decline, totaling 42 percent in 2004 (see Table 2). All types of lenders experienced a decline in classified assets during 2004, with U.S. banks showing the largest improvement, down 57 percent from the prior year. The quality of holdings also varied among entity types, with classifieds amounting to 3 percent of total commitments at U.S. banks, compared with 5 percent at FBOs and 13 percent at nonbanks. Total nonaccrual outstandings improved for all entity types. Most notably, U.S. banks experienced a 57 percent decline.

Risk Management by Banks Banking organizations remain vigilant in identifying problem credits and have generally reflected the appropriate risk rating in their internal ratings of credits in the SNC program. Although credit quality has improved, banking organizations must continue to carefully monitor the condition of their borrowers to ensure that they promptly identify and address any emerging weaknesses and adjust loan loss allowance levels appropriately.

The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program was established in 1977 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In 2001 the Office of Thrift Supervision became an assisting agency. With a few exceptions, the annual program, which seeks to provide an efficient and consistent review and classification of large syndicated loans, generally covers loans or loan commitments of at least $20 million that are shared by three or more financial institutions. 2. Loan commitments included both drawn and undrawn portions of a loan or loan facility. 3. Excerpt from Federal Reserve's SR Letter 79-556 defining regulatory classifications: Classification ratings are defined as "Substandard," "Doubtful," and "Loss." A Substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. An asset classified as Doubtful has all the weakness inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make the collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as Loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future. Excerpt from June 10, 1993 Interagency Statement on the Supervisory Definition of Special Mention Assets: A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution's credit position at some future date. Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 4. Nonaccrual loans are defined for regulatory reporting purposes as "loans and lease financing receivables that are required to be reported on a nonaccrual basis because (a) they are maintained on a cash basis due to a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower, (b) payment in full of interest or principal is not expected, or (c) principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or longer, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection." In Table 1, nonaccrual classifieds are those funded or outstanding portions of loans classified as substandard and doubtful which are not accruing interest. For 2004, this consisted of $19.2 billion in loans rated substandard and $11.7 billion rated doubtful. 5. Note that the current industry totals categorizes borrowers using 2002 NAICS codes, in contrast to prior release of SNC data which categorized borrowers using 1997 NAICS codes. 6. Nonbanks include independent investment brokerages, investment vehicles, and other institutional investors. 7. For further guidance, institutions should refer to the July 12, 1999 Joint Interagency Letter to Financial Institutions on the allowance for loan losses, as well as the July 2, 2001 Interagency Policy Statement on Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) Methodologies and Documentation for Banks and Savings Institutions. 8. NAICS groupings of industries identified in Appendix B are as follows: Telecommunication & Cable - 5132 through 51339; Manufacturing - 31 through 33 and 5121 through 5131; Professional, Scientific, and Other Services - 54, 55, 56, 61, and 62; Oil, Gas, Pipelines, and Utilities - 21 (oil- & gas-related only), 22, and 486; Construction & Real Estate - 23 and 53; Lodging and Transportation - 48 (excluding 486), 49, and 72; Financial Services and Insurance - 52; and All Other - remaining NAICS codes. Prior year data has been restated to reflect industry categorizations using 2002 NAICS groupings rather than 1997 NAICS groupings used in prior data releases.

Remarks by Governor Edward M. Gramlich At the Annual Economic Luncheon, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri September 16, 2004 Oil Shocks and Monetary Policy Oil shocks have confounded macroeconomists since they first arose on the scene in the 1970s. The oil price spikes of that time clearly had significant macroeconomic implications, representing one of the rare times that higher prices in an individual industry have importantly affected the overall macroeconomy. To account for these effects, structural-model builders had to disaggregate their systems into oil and non-oil, or energy and non-energy, sectors, dealing with effects on both the demand and the supply sides of the economy. The need to make such distinctions has greatly complicated the task of economic-model builders ever since. The challenges are even more pronounced for policymakers--fiscal or monetary. In a world where all shocks are on the demand side, policymaking boils down to finding the optimal balance between inflation and unemployment, or in modern parlance, finding the strategy that hits the optimal point on the frontier relating the variances of inflation and unemployment around their target values. Such an exercise can be quite complicated, building in all sorts of lags and expectation effects; but the basic analytical model has been around for a long time, and the reasoning is familiar. With oil shocks, policymakers are confronted with a new dilemma. Policy must then balance competing objectives in the presence of a shock that normally implies more inflation, more unemployment, or a combination thereof. In this environment, the choices become more difficult, and the public perceptions of how well stabilization policy is doing will inevitably decline. However, it is possible to distinguish between good and bad policy choices, even when no choice looks especially desirable. My remarks address these choices and how to make them. I will first review the evidence on the seriousness of oil shocks for the macroeconomy and then discuss how I think monetary policy should generally respond. I will follow this with a brief discussion of the current situation in the United States. How Serious are Oil Shocks? Oil shocks have serious effects on the economy because they immediately raise prices for an important production input--oil--and important consumer goods--gasoline and heating oil. They are also likely to push up prices in other energy markets. These price increases are significant enough that they typically show up as temporary bursts in the overall rate of inflation. They may even get passed through to continuing rates of inflation if they become incorporated into price- and wage-setting behavior. Increases in oil prices also reduce consumer spending power, in much the same way as when a new excise tax is passed along by oil producers. To the extent that these producers are foreign, there should be a corresponding drop in domestic demand. Even if the oil producers are domestic, a drop in domestic demand could still occur if the producers do not spend as much of their new income as consumers would have or if they do not recycle their profits to shareholders. Estimating the impact of these oil shocks on the real economy can be done in at least two ways. One approach, often associated with James Hamilton, measures the reduced-form correlation between oil price movements and subsequent movements in unemployment, or output gaps. Such an analysis is shown in , which compares aggregate real oil prices with a measure of the overall output gap. The figure shows that since 1973 every upward spike in real oil prices has been followed by a jump in the output gap. However, some of these jumps seem much larger than can be accounted for by oil prices alone, and there appears not to be a symmetric macro response to downward oil price shocks. But this result is still impressive because most of these oil price shocks have been perceived as temporary, as measured by the difference between the oil spot price and far futures price (discussed further below). Presumably, the macroeconomic impact would have been even more powerful for price shocks that were perceived as permanent. Hamilton and others have run a series of causality tests to these macro data and do find significant causal effects for oil prices. One can also analyze oil price shocks by using structural econometric models. These models would typically build in some sort of price-responsiveness behavior to measure pass-through effects. They would account for the effects of higher energy prices on the real disposable income and spending demands of the household sector. They would make similar calculations for business investment, working out the impact of oil prices on the cost of capital and business-cash flows, to the extent that these influence overall investment spending. When one does all this, as many economists are doing these days, one sees effects of about one-third of 1 percent on unemployment and slightly more for core inflation rates for a permanent shock in the price of oil of $10 a barrel. With appropriate transformations, these structural effects appear to be a good bit smaller than the implications of the reduced-form correlations. Why the difference? Many sources of discrepancy between the reduced form effects and the structural effects are possible. One involves consumers--perhaps a serious oil price shock could affect consumers' confidence or spending plans in a way that would not be captured by working out the effect of normal income and price elasticities. Capital investment may also be affected if the oil price shock encourages producers to substitute less-energy-intensive capital for more-energy-intensive capital. Of course, such a substitution will not necessarily lower aggregate demand if it requires more investment demand for new energy-saving equipment. Oil is a pervasive commodity, and other types of non-model effects are possible, but these consumption and investment effects seem the most obvious. How Should Monetary Policy Respond to Oil Price Shocks? Monetary policy makers in this country have a dual mandate, to stabilize prices and to maximize sustainable employment in the long run. Their response to oil price increases should focus on these two objectives. At one extreme, monetary policy makers might focus exclusively on the demand-reducing effect of oil shocks and try to stabilize unemployment rates. The risk from this approach is that prices would rise the full amount implied by the shock and would more likely be passed through into further wage and price increases. Continuing inflation rates could bump up the full amount of the initial boost in inflation. The continuing inflationary potential from the oil price shock would, in effect, be maximized. At the other extreme, monetary policy makers could focus exclusively on neutralizing the initial impact of the shock on inflation. Given the initial oil price shock, this approach would entail reducing demand enough to stabilize overall, or core, inflation rates. If prices were at all sluggish in their response to changes in unemployment, this approach could entail large increases in unemployment from the shock. Most observers would choose a policymaking approach somewhere between these two extremes. If, for example, monetary policy makers tried to keep overall nominal income on a steady path, the direct rise in nominal income from the oil price shock would be met by a fall in real income from somewhat higher unemployment. The result would be a temporary rise in both inflation and unemployment. Because the temporary rise in unemployment would damp price pressures, the chances that the initial oil price inflation would pass through into continuing inflation would be reduced. Most likely, the initial inflationary boost would prove temporary, permitting the rise in unemployment to be temporary as well. But nominal income targeting has its own deficiencies. First, since a large share of U.S. oil is imported, a significant difference could exist between the value-added price deflator comprising nominal income and more-appropriate measures of true consumer price inflation. Monetary policy makers would be better off focusing directly on these more-appropriate measures. Second, as before, if prices were highly sensitive to supply shocks but not sensitive to output movements, even nominal income targeting could imply substantial increases in unemployment. A better approach would be to follow a policy rule based directly on target values of unemployment and some appropriate measure of inflation. One example is a Taylor rule, under which monetary policy makers would move the short-term target interest rate--the federal funds rate in the United States--up or down to respond to deviations in core inflation and unemployment from their target values. The results would be qualitatively similar to those of the nominal income targeting rule, with a temporary rise in both inflation and unemployment, though the increases would now be more keyed to underlying monetary policy objectives. Because of the offsetting policy reactions, the real federal funds rate would be likely to remain approximately constant during this chain of events. If it did, the nominal funds rate would first rise and then fall with the inflation rate itself. While not a perfect outcome, this targeted intermediate approach is probably about the best that can be done. Were policy to try to avoid any rise in unemployment, the initial oil price shock might get passed through to continuing inflation. Were policy to try to avoid any rise in inflation, the movement in unemployment would be substantial. The best approach is likely to be to accept some temporary rise in both inflation and unemployment, with the increases being based on underlying objectives. The rises would be temporary so long as inflation did not persistently deviate from its long-term price-stability target. But even in this preferred approach, the widely watched nominal federal funds rate would likely rise for a time. Current Events With that backdrop, I will now turn to the current situation. As shown in , the spot price of oil (solid line) has recently spiked up, as it has several times since 1985. But in contrast to most other oil-price-spike episodes, this time the far futures price of oil--that is, the price for contracts seven years out--has also risen sharply. This correlation seems to indicate that the present oil price increase is not viewed as a purely temporary shock. At the same time, as shown in , which plots the difference between the spot price and the futures price, the current price is still greater than the far futures price, representing a phenomenon known as backwardation. Because of such backwardation, this oil price shock still seems to have an important temporary component. One question that arises immediately is whether the source of the shock matters. In the 1970s and 1980s, most oil shocks seemed clearly to be on the supply side in that international producers withheld production from the world market, either because of attempts to gain more oil revenue or because of other supply interruptions, such as the Iranian Revolution. Today, the high price of oil is much more likely to be due to demand growth in the United States, China, India, and other countries. Does the source matter when trying to determine how monetary policy should respond? If the demand growth that caused the oil price increases is domestic, it could mean that the price shock might be less permanent. The high oil prices would themselves cut into demand growth and tend to stabilize the system. If the demand growth is foreign, say from China and India, this feedback effect is still present but damped. Even foreign demand for oil might be influenced by reduced demand growth in the United States and its trading partners. It is certainly possible that oil shocks partially motivated by demand may be less permanent than true supply shocks, though that reasoning is contradicted by current-day oil futures prices. This whole issue, however, is new and imperfectly understood. It is not much of a silver lining, but the present price burst might provide some information on the qualitative difference between domestic and international demand and supply shocks. A second question is whether the present shock is large enough to cause macroeconomic ripples. As shows, even the present high real price of oil is only about half the real price in 1980, and the importance of energy in the overall economy is also less than half what it was then. At the same time, suggests that the permanent oil price rise is on the order of $15 a barrel. Since the United States now imports 4.5 billion barrels of oil per year, this price rise makes for an effective reduction in domestic income of $68 billion. To the extent that dollars going to domestic oil producers are not fully recycled, the effective demand reduction could be even greater. There could also be important parallel effects in natural gas and other markets. The rise in consumer prices from all these sources, as well as the reduction in aggregate demand, could be noticeable. All things considered, although the present oil shock may not be as significant as the shocks we remember from the 1970s and 1980s, it will definitely register. A final issue involves the initial position of the economy and monetary policy. In the usual exercise, one analyzes the economy in some sort of equilibrium position and posits an oil price shock, which normally results in the temporary increases in inflation and unemployment described earlier. When monetary policy begins with inordinately low nominal interest rates, the reasoning becomes more complicated. Now the response to the oil shock is, in effect, superimposed on any re-equilibration process built in for monetary policy. The ultimate response of the economy will blend the two responses, though not additively because of the complicated nonlinear structure of the economy. The net effect of these factors is difficult to perceive in any more than broad outline. Without the oil shock, policymakers beginning from a period of low interest rates would try to keep the economy on an even growth path as they gradually raised nominal interest rates. With the shocks, nominal rates would still likely follow an upward path, though the economic reactions would be bumpier, with temporary rises in both inflation and unemployment. Conclusion As a new economic event of the 1970s, oil price shocks forced monetary policy makers to rethink all their rules and added new chapters to macroeconomic textbooks. Today the question of how to respond to oil price spikes is better understood, but the outcomes are no more pleasant. It is virtually inevitable that shocks will result in some combination of higher inflation and higher unemployment for a time. But I must stress that the worst possible outcome is not these temporary increases in inflation and unemployment. The worst possible outcome is for monetary policy makers to let inflation come loose from its moorings. Footnotes James D.

Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies To the Cincinnati Chapter of the Ohio Society of Certified Public Accountants, Cincinnati, Ohio September 28, 2004 Challenges Facing the Accounting Profession Today Introduction Good evening. Thank you for the invitation to speak to you during your annual CPA Recognition Night. Those of you who are new to the profession no doubt realize, just as your more experienced colleagues do, that you are entering into this noble area of service during a dynamic and crucial time in its existence. You are entering the profession just as new rules, greater responsibility and increased scrutiny are being imposed on accountants and auditors alike in response to the discovery of accounting and auditing improprieties in the recent past. In addition, as the world of commerce and business continues to change, it is vital that the accounting profession responds to meet the challenges of auditing new innovations. This evening, I will share some of my views on the challenges that the profession faces today, particularly with regard to accounting and auditing in service industries and model-based accounting. Accounting in a Service Based Economy I think it is fair to say that nearly all of us, including those of you who are new to the profession, first learned about accounting from the "old economy" perspective of retail and manufacturing. Our accounting text books gave us examples and exercises that pertained to the XYZ Corporation that sold widgets. In this context, we learned that assets and liabilities were valued on a historical cost basis and that the earnings cycle was completed when sales occurred. Indeed, we learned the fundamental concept that revenue was recognized only when it was earned. Today, our economy is becoming more and more service-based. Unlike in manufacturing and retail trade, where the sale marks the end of the earnings process, in most services the sale of the service marks the beginning of the earnings process. In the case of services, once the sale has closed, revenues are earned over the ensuing period in which such services are rendered. If earnings are recorded at the time of the sale, that is at the beginning of the service process or before risks are transferred, the financial statements may not be reflecting the earnings process. You may recall that the practice of recognizing revenue "up front" was used by some high-tech firms a few years ago, sometimes in inappropriate circumstances. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance at that time to clarify that revenue should be deferred until it is earned. One major industry affected by these concepts is the financial services industry. While a small amount of revenue is received for transactions, most is generated by sales that lead to future revenue streams, such as that when a checking account is opened. In the context of the financial services industry, the accounting practice used today is sometimes called the "mixed attribute" approach. This means that some assets and liabilities continue to be recorded on a historical cost basis, while others are reported at fair value or at lower-of-cost-or-market (LOCOM). In some instances in the mixed attribute approach, changes in fair value are reported in earnings, while in other cases they are excluded from earnings but affect the equity portion of the balance sheet. For example, assets that are included in the trading account are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are reported in earnings during the period. However, securities that are intended to be held until maturity are reported at amortized cost with no change in fair value recognized in earnings unless permanent impairment has occurred. Loans that are held-for-sale are separately reported on the balance sheet and recorded at LOCOM, while loans that a bank intends to hold for the long-term are reported at amortized cost. The mixed attribute accounting model is effective for financial services because it reflects differences in the earnings process. Thus, when profits are generated through the trading account, earnings are driven by the activity of buying and selling securities. Traders make decisions about what to buy, and the market timing of the purchases and sales rest on comparisons of relative returns on the alternative securities. The success of a trading account as a business reflects management's ability to identify unusual valuations in the market and quickly act upon them. In this case, a fair value framework is appropriate for accounting since it is similar to the information and decision process that management is using. An example of a different business model is a floating rate loan that is made and held on the balance sheet with the intent to service the loan until it is paid off. Here, the floating rate means that changes in market interest rates will not affect the fair value of the loan. Rather, credit quality and the cost to service the loan are the two major drivers of profitability. Management's ability to underwrite the credit initially, manage changes in credit risk over the life of the loan, and limit losses of principal and interest and collection costs should a default occur, are key drivers of credit costs. In addition, the costs to receive and post payments and service the loan over its life are important drivers of the operating costs of making the loan. In this case of loans made to be held in portfolio, amortized cost is appropriate accounting. The interest received over the life of the loan supports the operating costs to service the loan that are incurred while it is outstanding, as well as credit losses that occur, and the cost to acquire funding for the loan. To the user of financial statements, amortized yield, operating costs, funding costs, and credit quality each need to be visible to the user of financial statements, and be reflected in the period in which they are earned or incurred. Fair Value Accounting and Auditing While historical cost accounting methods have well-developed auditing techniques, fair value accounting relies on key assumptions, modeling techniques and judgment. For example, modeling techniques are commonly used in valuing mortgage loan servicing assets. The present value of the estimated future net cash flows of servicing assets attempts to anticipate prepayments of mortgages due to changing interest rates, fees earned from late payments, cost to receive payments and remit funds to investors, costs to handle delinquent and charged-off loans and other factors. Changes in the assumptions used in the modeling approach for any instrument or product will change the resulting values. Further, the models used for financial statements look to what the market would expect these revenues and costs to be, rather than the firm's specific information. Since sales of servicing assets, especially for seasoned loans, is so irregular, it is often difficult to validate the model against actual values seen in the market. Thus, auditing model-based accounting requires a high level of specialized knowledge. The auditor must fully understand how modeling or other sophisticated techniques are used to determine fair value, and whether the assumptions used in the models are appropriate, and that the data has integrity. Furthermore, "fair value" is not always clearly defined or easily determined for some products or instruments. Certainly, a non-complex instrument that is highly liquid with an observable market price is easier to value with more precision than a highly complex, illiquid instrument. Accountants are being asked to know more than just the proper classification of assets and liabilities, but also the appropriate way to value assets and liabilities. Let me mention that the Federal Reserve supports a fair value-based measurement for assets and liabilities used in the business of short-term trading for profit, such as the trading account for banks. And we support enhanced disclosures of fair value-based information. However, we believe that the accounting industry should be very careful before moving toward a comprehensive fair value approach, where all assets and liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings, whether or not realized. In today's world, with the myriad of complex financial instruments that exist and are constantly being created, developing verifiable and auditable fair value estimates is a major concern. The lack of observable market prices, differences in modeling assumptions, expectations of future events and market conditions, as well as customer behavior make the task of assigning appropriate valuations very difficult. And because fair value models are forward looking, the auditor has an additional challenge of determining the line between normal variability in expectations that surrounds any forecast and earnings manipulation. To its credit, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has recently issued an exposure draft on fair value measurement. The proposal was developed to provide a framework for fair value measurement objectives, and it is just the initial phase of a long-term fair value project. The initial phase is generally intended to apply to financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are currently subject to fair value measurement and disclosure. It is not intended to expand the use of fair value measurements in financial statements at the present time. In our view, the proposal is a good first step in enhancing fair value measurement guidance, but we believe additional guidance is warranted. Reliability issues should be addressed more comprehensively in the proposal. Most important, the FASB should develop further guidance and conduct further research and testing to enhance the reliability of fair value measurements before the use of fair value is significantly expanded in the primary financial statements. Furthermore, we believe that the FASB should work with other organizations including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), and accounting firms to enable the development of robust guidance that ensures fair value estimates can be verified and audited. Transparent Disclosure These concerns, among others, also raise the importance of disclosures in the financial statements that assist readers in understanding how the financial statements reflect the business strategy, risk management, and operating effectiveness of the enterprise. As organizations have grown in size and scope, innovative financing techniques have made it more difficult for outside investors to understand a particular firm's risk profile and the performance of its various lines of business. Traditional accounting standards have not kept pace with the risk-management tools employed by sophisticated corporations. Thus, more meaningful disclosures of firms' risk-management positions and strategies are crucial for improving corporate transparency for market participants. The improvements in technology, the quick pace of financial innovation, and the evolving risk-management techniques enable businesses to use almost limitless configurations of products and services and sophisticated financial structures. Accordingly, outsiders will have ever more difficulty understanding the risk positions of many large, complex organizations. These developments represent significant challenges to standard setters and to accounting firms. For market discipline to be effective, accounting standards and disclosures must evolve to accurately capture these developments. Challenges for Auditors Auditing firms are facing the growing challenge to build and pass along the knowledge possessed by their professionals who truly understand the audit and accounting issues around particular business lines. As companies broaden the range of products, services, and delivery channels they offer, clients require more specialized knowledge for each operation. As we are all aware, there are fewer large accounting firms competing in the marketplace today. I understand that many of the larger accounting firms are no longer accepting audit engagements of some smaller or medium-sized companies. This opens an opportunity for small to medium-sized auditing firms to become specialists--so-called "niche players." In this way, smaller auditing firms can develop the expertise of their auditing staff around the accounting and business practices of the specialized industries or particular types of clients, as knowledge-sharing can be more successful when it is naturally more targeted. Perhaps a broader question facing the auditing industry today is how to maintain and instill the appropriate professional judgment required of auditors as accounting theory moves towards a more principles-based approach. One impact that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is having on preparers and auditors of financial statements is the quest for more "bright line" rules so they can more readily know when an interpretation comes close to the acceptable limit. But the changing business world, especially around financial instruments, is making it impossible to write an accounting rule for each potential nuance of innovation, and so we are turning to more principles-based accounting. Thus, sound judgment is becoming a more valuable talent to businesses and their auditors. As CPAs, one of your most important missions is to reinvigorate the profession to successfully address these conflicting goals. Other Challenges Let me also mention an area that places increased responsibility on auditors. I mentioned earlier the PCAOB. The PCAOB was created through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to oversee the auditors of public companies. The PCAOB has recently approved Auditing Standard No. 2, An Audit of Internal Control over Financial Reporting Conducted in Conjunction with an Audit of Financial Statements. The new standard highlights the benefits of strong internal controls over financial reporting and furthers the objectives of Sarbanes-Oxley. This standard requires external auditors of public companies to evaluate the process that management uses to prepare the company's financial statements. External auditors must gather evidence regarding the design and operations effectiveness of the company's internal controls and determine whether the evidence supports management's assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal controls. While the new standard allows external auditors to use the work of others, including work performed by internal auditors, it emphasizes that external auditors must perform enough of the testing themselves so that their own work provides the principal evidence for making a determination regarding the company's controls. Based on the work performed, the external auditor must render an opinion as to whether the company's internal control process is effective, which is a relatively high standard. In addition, as part of its overall assessment of internal controls, the external auditor is expected to evaluate the effectiveness of the audit committee. If the audit committee is deemed to be ineffective, the external auditor is required to report that assessment to the company's board of directors. This new standard will certainly put more demands on external auditors and public companies alike. But in the world of business and financial innovation and growing complexity of firms, these standards should encourage greater reliability of corporate financial statements and therefore, regain the confidence of the public and the trust of financial markets. Conclusion In conclusion, I hope my views will give you an opportunity to think about some of the challenges both accountants and auditors face in today's business environment. The accounting industry should be cautious and prudent as it debates the merits of fair value accounting. Accountants and auditors alike must be knowledgeable of the models and assumptions used in determining the fair value of products and services. A models-based approach to valuations must produce results that accountants, auditors, and market participants feel are objective. Standardsetters have the daunting task of balancing the need to provide accounting principles that keep pace with financial innovation with the need to promulgate standards that produce accurate, reliable and verifiable results.

Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies At the Bond Market Association's Regional Bond Traders and Sales Managers Roundtable, Irving, Texas September 30, 2004 Developments in Financial Markets and Financial Management I am very pleased to join you for this meeting of the Bond Market Association. Tonight, I would like to talk about my views on the economy, and then draw to your attention some emerging regulatory issues that affect your businesses. First, I would like to briefly share with you my assessment of the economic outlook and discuss in more detail how households and businesses appear poised for an expected rise in interest rates. Second, I want to discuss some issues related to the accounting and auditing of securities. I also need to add that in terms of the economic outlook, I am expressing my own opinions, which are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee. The Economic Outlook As you know, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the second quarter, building on larger increases since the middle of 2003. After having moderated a bit in late spring, partly in response to a substantial rise in energy prices, output growth appears to have regained some traction. Both consumer spending and housing starts jumped in July and held steady in August. Business outlays for capital equipment also appear to be on an upward trend, continuing to rebound from their weakness of the past several years. And with financial conditions still accommodative, I expect that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace for the remainder of the year. At the same time, it appears that inflation and inflation expectations have eased. The core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, edged up only 0.1 percent in each of the past three months through August. This pace is substantially below the pace of earlier this year, when inflation was likely boosted by some transitory factors, such as the pass-through of large increases in energy and import prices, and some payback from the unusually modest increases in 2003. I expect underlying inflation to remain low, and, in my view, under these circumstances the Federal Reserve can remove its policy accommodation at a measured pace, consistent with its commitment to maintain price stability as a necessary condition for maximum sustainable economic growth. Household Financial Conditions Continued vigorous expansion depends importantly on consumer spending, so let me spend a few minutes on the financial condition of the household sector. Some commentators have expressed concern about the rapid growth in household debt in recent years. They fear that households have become overextended and will need to rein in their spending to keep their debt burdens under control. My view is considerably more sanguine. Although there are pockets of financial stress among households, the sector as a whole appears to be in good shape. It is true that households have taken on quite a bit of debt over the past several years. According to the latest available data, total household debt grew at an annual rate of about 10 percent between the end of 1999 and the second quarter of 2004; in comparison, after-tax household income increased at a rate of about 5 percent. But looking below the aggregate data, we must understand that the rapid growth in household debt reflects largely a surge in mortgage borrowing, which has been fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates and strong growth in house prices. Indeed, many homeowners have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages, some having done so several times over the past couple of years. Survey data suggest that homeowners took out cash in more than one-half of these "refis," often to pay down loans having higher interest rates. On net, the resulting drop in the average interest rate on household borrowings, combined with the lengthening maturity of their total debt, has damped the monthly payments made by homeowners on their growing stock of outstanding debt. The Federal Reserve publishes two data series that quantify the burden of household obligations. The first series, the debt-service ratio, measures the required payments on mortgage and consumer debt as a share of after-tax personal income. The second series, the financial-obligations ratio, is a broader version of the debt-service ratio that includes required household payments on rent, auto leases, homeowners insurance, and property taxes. Both ratios rose during the 1990s, and both reached a peak in late 2001. Since then, however, they have receded slightly on net, an indication that households, in the aggregate, have been keeping an eye on repayment burdens. Moreover, delinquency rates for a wide range of household loans have continued to drift down this year and lie below recent highs in 2001. To be sure, mortgage rates and other consumer loan rates have come off the lows reached early this year, and concerns have been heightened about interest payment burdens for households. Although some households will be pressured by the higher rates, I believe the concerns can be overstated. First, most household debt--mortgage and consumer debt combined--carries a fixed interest rate, which slows the adjustment of interest costs to rising rates. Second, although interest rates on some variable-rate loans will rise quickly, the adjustment for a large number of variable-rate loans could be a good deal slower. For example, many adjustable-rate mortgages start off with a fixed rate for several years, providing households with some protection from rising rates. This relatively upbeat assessment of household credit quality seems to be shared by lenders and by investors in securities backed by consumer debt. According to the Federal Reserve's survey of senior loan officers, the number of banks tightening their standards on consumer loans has fallen over the past year. Moreover, credit spreads on securities backed by auto loans and credit card receivables have narrowed in recent months. These indicators do not point to much concern about household loan performance. Thus far, I have focused on the liability side of the household balance sheet. There have been favorable developments on the asset side as well. Equity prices rallied strongly last year and have held their ground this year, reversing a good portion of the losses sustained over the previous three years. In addition, home prices have appreciated sharply since 1997. All told, the ratio of household net worth to disposable income--a useful summary of the sector's financial position--has climbed in the past couple of years and currently stands at a high level relative to the past decade. Financial Conditions of Businesses Businesses are also in good financial shape, reflecting a dramatic improvement in recent years. Indeed, starting last year, many firms found themselves in the unusual position of being able to finance a pickup in spending entirely out of rapidly rising cash flow, and those that turned to external markets generally found the financing environment to be quite accommodative. This improvement in financial conditions reflects a number of factors, namely low interest rates, a widespread restructuring of corporate liabilities, and significant cost-cutting and productivity gains that boosted profitability. In my view, even with an expected rise in interest rates and some moderation in profit growth, the financial condition of the business sector should remain strong and able to support continued expansion. I will address each factor in turn. First, firms are continuing to benefit from the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Even with the increase by the FOMC last week in the target funds rate to 1.75 percent, short-term borrowing costs remain low. For longer-term debt, the combination of low yields on benchmark Treasury securities and sharply-reduced risk spreads from a couple of years ago has kept borrowing costs quite attractive. The reduced risk spreads reflect the improved financial positions and more positive investor sentiment, perhaps as accounting and corporate governance scandals have receded. Second, in response to low long-term rates and to investors' concerns arising from some high-profile, unanticipated meltdowns, firms have greatly strengthened their balance sheets. Many firms have refinanced high-cost debt, a move that has reduced the average interest rate on the debt of nonfinancial corporations by about 1 percentage point, on net, since the end of 2000. Businesses have also substituted long-term debt for short-maturity debt to improve their balance sheet liquidity and to reduce the risk of rolling over funds. In addition, many firms--especially in the most troubled industries--have retired debt through equity offerings and asset sales, while others have used their growing profits to retire debt. As a result, the growth of nonfinancial corporate debt in the past two-and-a-half years was limited to its slowest pace since the early 1990s. These repairs to balance sheets have also reduced the exposure of many firms to rising interest rates, especially in the near term. In particular, the replacement of short-term debt by long-term bonds means that less debt will have to be rolled over in the near term at higher rates. In addition, because much of the long-term debt has a fixed rate, interest payments typically are unaffected over the life of the bond. Moreover, research by Board staff suggests that firms which are more likely to rely on floating-rate debt, and for that reason might be more vulnerable to rising rates, have tended to use derivatives in recent years to hedge their exposure to interest rate risk. Thus, for many firms, the effect of rising interest rates will be mitigated and stretched out over time. In addition, a lesson we can take from the episode of policy tightening in 1994 is that rising interest rates have little detrimental effect on the financial health of the corporate sector when the rate increases occur in the context of an expanding economy. Specifically, corporate credit quality improved on balance after 1994 with the pickup in economic activity and corporate profits. Third, the improvement in financial conditions among businesses owes partly to some significant belt-tightening by many firms. Over the past few years, the drive to cut costs and boost efficiency has generated rapid productivity gains. Fuller utilization of the capabilities of capital already in place, ongoing improvements in inventory management, and streamlined production processes requiring fewer workers, to name but a few examples of efficiency enhancements, have boosted corporate profitability even when revenue growth was tepid. With the pick up in revenue growth in the second half of last year, companies were able to leverage the productivity gains and produce a dramatic recovery in overall corporate profitability. The profits of nonfinancial corporations as a share of sector output rose to almost 11 percent in the second quarter of this year. This share lies above its long-run average over the past few decades and well above the cyclical trough of 7 percent in 2001. To be sure, the profit share likely will slip a bit from its high level as the expansion gains steam and businesses are less able to keep a lid on their labor costs. Moreover, because cyclical factors likely contributed to the recent dramatic advances in productivity, we should expect productivity gains to moderate. But these developments and the decline in profit share are to be expected and will not, in my view, lead to a meaningful impairment of the financial health of companies. The improvements that businesses have made to their financial strength and profitability have been substantial and should help to support sustained, solid growth of the U.S. economy. Accounting for Securities Let me now turn to some supervisory issues that are currently being considered. The first is the recent accounting guidance surrounding The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments , or EITF 03-01. As many of you are aware, when the Emerging Issues Task Force came to its consensus earlier this year, it appeared to follow practices generally in use. But early in August, one public accounting firm interpreted the guidance very differently. Specifically, if a security was sold from the available-for-sale investment portfolio at a loss, this new interpretation called into question the facts and circumstances that should be used to determine if the remaining portfolio should be viewed as "other than temporarily impaired," and thereby marked down to the lower of cost or market through earnings (LOCOM). At the Federal Reserve, we were concerned about this interpretation since most banks use their available-for-sale portfolio to manage their net interest margin on longer-term, fixed-rate deposits and funding. A LOCOM accounting model applied to such instruments is not consistent with this important management function. We have always expected banks to regularly review the fair values of all their securities. But the concept of "tainting" due to realized losses from the available-for-sale portfolio had not been widely applied in such a narrow way. I commend the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for listening to questions raised by preparers, auditors, and bank regulators and agreeing to defer the effective date for the troublesome paragraph 16 from the third to the fourth quarter. It has also issued some implementation guidance, and has a comment period that runs until October 25. I would encourage you to read the new guidance, and to provide comments if you feel additional clarification is needed. Pay particular attention to the facts and circumstances that should be considered. Note that the guidance allows sales of available-for-sale securities at a loss for the same reasons that you can sell held-to-maturity securities without tainting the remaining portfolio, for example mergers and changes in regulatory capital. The guidance also permits sales for unexpected and significant changes in liquidity needs or increases in interest rates. In practice, EITF 03-01 should make all organizations with available-for-sale securities review their procedures for identifying impairment. Clearly, investors should continue their current practice of monitoring for credit downgrades and changes in prepayment speeds, especially for mortgage-backed securities booked at a premium and interest-only strips. But in addition, the trigger for recognizing impairment is no longer an intent to sell, but rather whether the investor no longer intends to hold the security until fair value recovers to its amortized cost. Also note that the disclosure aspects of EITF 03-01 do apply in third quarter financial statements. The major change is separate disclosure of securities whose fair value is below carrying cost. Organizations now must disclose separately the amount of securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than one year, and in the narrative discuss why the loss has not yet been recognized. Fair Value and Regulatory Capital Issues As you know, the Basel II effort to revise bank risk-based capital standards is now in its final stages and moving toward implementation. Importantly, that effort has adopted an approach to credit risk on instruments held in the banking book that differs from the current capital rules applied to instruments held in the trading book under the 1998 Market Risk Amendment (MRA) to the Basel Accord. Clearly, the fair valuing or "marking to market" of trading portfolios and the implied holding period of such positions factor into such differences. At the same time, however, we must remember that the MRA approach was adopted at a time when bank trading portfolios looked very different from today. The significant growth in the credit derivative market is just one example. Also, there appears to be an increasing tendency for financial institutions to hold less-liquid instruments in trading accounts over longer time horizons than has been traditionally associated with the concept of a trading account. This suggests that the time may have arrived for supervisors to begin to review the implications that financial market innovation and the changing nature of trading accounts have for the current capital regime applied to these activities. In an initial effort to fully identify the types and characteristics of instruments that are held by banks in their trading accounts, and that are held at fair value by securities firms, a joint subgroup of International Organization of Securities Commissions and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is surveying the industry. This survey is also focused on gaining a better perspective on the range of techniques financial institutions are developing to more robustly measure the risk these instruments entail. The information acquired in this survey is to be fully incorporated in supervisors' review of the current adequacy of the MRA. It is important for me to note that this effort to review the MRA is still in its early stages. As yet, it is uncertain whether this effort will result in minor revisions to the current MRA or significant changes. Challenges in Securities Accounting and Auditing Both of these issues relating to practices around securities accounting should also be viewed in light of broader issues that are challenging corporate management, independent accountants, and regulators. Fair value accounting for securities, whether in the income statement or in disclosures, relies on key assumptions, modeling techniques and judgment. For example, modeling techniques are commonly used in valuing mortgage-backed securities. The present value of the estimated future net cash flows attempts to anticipate consumer behavior to adjust for prepayments of mortgages due to forecasted interest rates. Changes in the assumptions used in the modeling approach for any instrument or product will affect the resulting values. For example, if property values are rising rather than falling, the buildup of equity in the home can affect the borrowers desire to refinance the loan or use the equity to purchase a more expensive home. Thus, auditing model-based fair values for accounting purposes requires a high level of specialized knowledge. The auditor must fully understand how modeling or other sophisticated techniques are used to determine fair value, and whether the assumptions used in the models are appropriate, and whether the data has integrity. Furthermore, "fair value" is not always clearly defined or easily determined for some products or instruments. The lack of observable market prices, differences in modeling assumptions, expectations of future events and market conditions, as well as customer behavior make the task of assigning appropriate valuations very difficult. Certainly, a non-complex instrument that is highly liquid with an observable market price is easier to value with more precision than a highly complex, illiquid instrument. In today's world, with the myriad of complex financial instruments that exist and are constantly being created, developing verifiable and auditable fair value estimates is a major concern. And because fair value models are forward looking, the auditor has an additional challenge of determining the line between normal variability in expectations that surrounds any forecast and earnings manipulation. To its credit, the FASB has recently issued an exposure draft on fair value measurement. The proposal was developed to provide a framework for fair value measurement objectives, and it is just the initial phase of a long-term fair value project. The initial phase is generally intended to apply to financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are currently subject to fair value measurement and disclosure. It is not intended to expand the use of fair value measurements in financial statements at the present time. In my view, the proposal is a good first step in enhancing fair value measurement guidance, but I believe additional guidance is warranted. Reliability issues should be addressed more comprehensively in the proposal. Most important, the FASB should develop further guidance and conduct further research and testing to enhance the reliability of fair value measurements before the use of fair value is significantly expanded in the primary financial statements. Furthermore, the FASB should work with other organizations including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), and accounting firms to enable the development of robust guidance that ensures fair value estimates can be verified and audited. Conclusion In summary, I expect that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace for the remainder of the year. At the same time, it appears that inflation and inflation expectations have eased. I encourage you to not only focus on economic conditions that affect the bond market, but to also pay attention to emerging regulatory issues. The depth and diversity of bond markets will continue to support economic expansion as long as investors can rely on the integrity of information about issuers and characteristics of specific securities.
