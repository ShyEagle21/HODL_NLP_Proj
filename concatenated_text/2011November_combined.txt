Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve SystemConsumer Financial Protection BureauFederal Deposit Insurance CorporationNational Credit Union AdministrationOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency Agencies Issue Statement to Clarify Supervisory and Enforcement ResponsibilitiesFor Federal Consumer Financial Laws Washington--A statement that explains how the total assets of an insured bank, thrift or credit union will be measured for purposes of determining supervisory and enforcement responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was issued today by five federal financial supervisory agencies. Under section 1025 of Dodd-Frank, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has exclusive authority to examine for compliance with federal consumer financial laws and primary authority to enforce those laws for institutions with total assets of more than $10 billion, and their affiliates. Section 1026 confirms that the four prudential regulators--the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency--will retain supervisory and enforcement authority for other institutions. The policy statement issued today clarifies the application of sections 1025 and 1026 by addressing two key matters: the measure to be used to determine asset size and the schedule for making such determinations. The statement explains that a common measure of the asset size of an insured depository institution is the total assets reported in the quarterly Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports), which banks, thrifts, and insured credit unions are required to file. The statement also explains the need to establish a schedule for determining the size of an institution that avoids unwarranted uncertainty or volatility regarding the identity of an institution's primary supervisor for federal consumer financial laws. Such conditions could both impose increased burden on institutions and interfere with the orderly implementation of the agencies' responsibilities with respect to the federal consumer financial laws. In order to avoid these adverse consequences, the agencies are adapting criteria used for deposit insurance assessment purposes. Accordingly, after an initial asset size determination based on June 30, 2011, data, an institution generally will not be reclassified unless four consecutive quarterly reports indicate that a change in supervisor is warranted.
Vice Chair Janet L. Yellen At the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, California Good morning. I'm delighted to return "home" to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and honored to kick off the Bank's second Asia Economic Policy Conference. In my remarks this morning I will underscore the urgency of strengthened international policy cooperation to attain strong, sustainable and balanced growth in the global economy--a theme that received emphasis at the Group of Twenty (G-20) Leaders' Summit in Cannes earlier this month. The global economy is facing critical challenges. The recovery in the United States and other advanced economies has been proceeding too slowly to provide jobs for millions of unemployed people. There have also been clear signs of slowing growth in emerging market economies over the past year. In effect, we face a dearth of aggregate demand, not just among the advanced economies, but also for the global economy as a whole.1 In ordinary times, policymakers in the advanced countries would address such a demand shortfall with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. But these are no ordinary times. Central banks in a number of advanced economies, including the United States, have brought short-term interest rates close to zero, so that further monetary accommodation can be provided only through unconventional tools, such as securities purchases and forward policy guidance. Meanwhile, the scope for fiscal stimulus is limited by concerns about sizable budget deficits and longer-term sustainability. At the G-20 summit earlier this month in Cannes, the United States and other advanced economies--including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the United Kingdom--agreed to pursue fiscal consolidation plans to place public finances on a sustainable course over the medium term while sustaining the near-term recovery. Indeed, in the current environment of weak demand, near-term fiscal consolidation could threaten the economic recovery, which in turn may undermine the success of the fiscal strategy. In such circumstances, economies with the capacity to stimulate global growth‑‑namely, countries with large current account surpluses and the potential to expand domestic demand--must take a leading role in adopting policies to rebalance and sustain the global economy. This commitment was made by all of the G-20 leaders, including those from China, Indonesia, South Korea, and other emerging markets. In the remainder of my remarks, I will point out some key factors that have been restraining the pace of U.S. economic growth, and I will discuss the need for fiscal adjustments to place our federal budget on a sustainable path over the medium term without impairing the economic recovery. I will then turn to a consideration of the crucial role of the Asian economies in fostering a stronger global recovery. Of course, these remarks solely reflect my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System. U.S. Economic GrowthSince the middle of 2009, the U.S. economy has been recovering from the most severe recession and financial crisis to afflict our country since the Great Depression. However, the pace of the economic recovery has been less vigorous than desired or expected, and the unemployment rate has declined only about 1 percentage point over the past two years. Indeed, the number of jobs in the private sector remains more than 6 million below the peak level reached in early 2008--a distressing development made all the worse by the fact that new entrants have, of course, continued to come into the labor force in recent years. The fraction of those now jobless who have been without work for six months or more stands at a very high level. In addition to those officially unemployed, many individuals are involuntarily working part time or have dropped out of the labor force entirely. The pace of economic growth in the second half of this year has been somewhat faster than in the first half, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on growth earlier in the year. Nonetheless, a range of more-persistent factors also appear to be restraining the recovery. In recognition of these drags, the consensus of professional forecasters in the survey released earlier this month by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia was that unemployment would decline only slightly in the next few years, to an average rate of 8.4 percent in 2013. Moreover, financial market conditions have deteriorated, on net, in recent months, intensifying some of the headwinds facing the economy. At the onset of the financial crisis, consumer spending contracted sharply and the personal saving rate began a steep ascent.Exhibit 1shows that the saving rate rose from around 2-1/2 percent in 2006 to about 5 percent in the first half of this year. It now appears that consumer spending is advancing at a moderate pace. In the pre-crisis years, consumer spending grew rapidly, providing considerable impetus to the expansion. In contrast, over the next few years, consumer spending seems unlikely to serve as one of the main engines of growth. The ratio of household debt-to-income remains exceptionally high, even though over the past few years it has declined slightly from the post-World War II peak reached prior to the crisis. Although households appear to have made some progress in deleveraging, many still face elevated debt burdens and reduced access to credit. Moreover, high levels of unemployment and underemployment, slow gains in wages, and declines in the values of both homes and financial assets have weighed on household spending and diminished the ability of households to tap home equity in emergencies or for other purposes. Consumer sentiment dropped markedly over the summer and remains quite depressed, apparently reflecting households' concerns about the broader economy as well as their own financial situations. A sharp downturn in housing was at the core of the previous recession, and this sector continues to weigh on the recovery. Robust increases in housing activity have helped spur recoveries from most U.S. recessions since World War II. This time, in contrast, residential construction remains depressed by a large inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties either currently available for purchase or probably soon to become so, tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages, and concerns about the possibility of further declines in home prices. As a result, new home construction currently is at only about one-third of its average pace in recent decades. In addition, homeowners with insufficient equity in their homes have found it difficult to take advantage of today's low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages. Recently announced changes to the federal government's Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, are designed to improve the opportunity for homeowners to refinance and I'm hopeful this program will succeed in reducing household debt service burdens and the flow of foreclosures. More generally, I see a strong case for additional policies to foster more-rapid recovery in the housing sector. Indeed, to provide greater support for mortgage markets, the Federal Reserve recently adjusted its program for reinvesting its securities holdings. The Federal Reserve continues to provide highly accommodative monetary conditions to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Moreover, the scope remains to provide additional accommodation through enhanced guidance on the path of the federal funds rate or through additional purchases of longer-term financial assets. Challenges for U.S. Fiscal PolicyTurning now to U.S. fiscal policy, with the onset of the recent recession and financial crisis, the federal budget deficit widened significantly and has remained wide.Exhibit 2shows that, as a result, federal debt held by the public has increased relative to our national income to a level not seen in the past half-century. These budget developments have reflected both the weak economy, which has depressed revenues and pushed up expenditures, and the fiscal stimulus that was implemented to help ease the recession and support the recovery. So long as the economy continues to recover, the deficit should narrow over the next several years as a growing economy boosts revenues and reduces expenditures and as the policies put in place to provide economic stimulus continue to wind down. Even so, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) will continue to edge higher over the next decade unless the Congress and the Administration are able to agree on a program of deficit reduction that is more ambitious than the targets incorporated in last summer's Budget Control Act. Looking yet further out, it is apparent that, absent significant policy shifts, budget pressures resulting from the aging of the U.S. population and fast-rising health-care costs will continue to push the federal debt ratio higher in coming decades. The dashed line in exhibit 2 shows the Congressional Budget Office's long-term projection of the debt-to-GDP ratio through 2035 under current policy settings, including the effects of the Budget Control Act. It is crucial that the federal budget be put on a sustainable long-run trajectory, and we should not postpone charting that course. A failure to put in place a credible plan to address our long-run budget imbalance would expose the United States to serious economic costs and risks in the long term and possibly sooner. Timely enactment of a plan to put the federal budget onto a sustainable trajectory will make it easier for individuals and businesses to prepare for these adjustments. In addition, the sooner our longer-term budget problems are addressed, the less wrenching the adjustment will have to be and the more control that policymakers--rather than market forces or international creditors--will have over the timing, size, and composition of the necessary adjustments. At the same time, too much fiscal tightening in the near term could harm the economic recovery. Significant near-term reductions in federal spending or large increases in taxes would impose an additional drag on the economy at a time when aggregate demand is already weak. Indeed, under current law, federal fiscal policy is slated to impose considerable restraint on the growth of aggregate demand next year. We need, and I believe we have scope for, an approach to fiscal policy that puts in place a well-timed and credible plan to bring deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium and long terms while also addressing the economy's short-term needs. I do not underestimate the difficulty of crafting a strategy that appropriately balances short-run needs with long-run considerations, but doing so would provide important benefits to the U.S. economy. The Key Role of the Emerging Asian EconomiesIn light of the various factors weighing on aggregate demand in the United States and other advanced economies, I believe it is crucial for emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, to take further steps to boost domestic demand, providing support for their own growth and that of the global economy. Indeed, such policies are a core component of the G-20 nations' commitment to strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. Of course, emerging Asia has already made an important contribution to bolstering the global economy in the wake of the financial crisis. The top panel ofexhibit 3shows that even though the emerging Asian economies were hit quite hard by the global downturn, they recovered much more quickly than did other parts of the world. The full extent of the Asian bounceback can perhaps best be appreciated by comparing the level of output in Asia, shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit, with those in advanced economies and other emerging market economies. Asia's output level--the solid line--has increased substantially from its barely perceptible trough. Output in other emerging market economies--the dashed line--has also increased significantly. In comparison, output in the advanced economies--the dotted line--has not yet attained its pre-crisis peak. A key factor contributing to the relatively rapid recovery of the Asian emerging market economies was that, in contrast to many previous episodes of severe stress, these economies were well-positioned to permit the use of countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies. Cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances in emerging Asian economies fell noticeably in 2008 and 2009, reflecting a more expansionary fiscal stance; fiscal stimulus was particularly large in China, India, and Singapore. Monetary policy was also eased substantially throughout emerging Asia. Partly as a result of those policy measures, the growth of the emerging Asian economies over the past several years appears to have relied less on external demand from the advanced economies. The top panel ofexhibit 4shows that the shares of exports in nominal GDP in the Asian economies have trended downwards since 2006 following a decade of solid increases. However, trade balances in the region (shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit) generally remain in surplus, notwithstanding some recent narrowing in several countries. These surpluses suggest that, on balance, the Asian economies continue to add more to global supply than to global demand. Crucially, private consumption as a share of output still remains quite low in several emerging Asian economies.Exhibit 5shows that China's consumption share--the solid line--which was already well below that of other major economies in 2000, has fallen steadily over the past decade to about one-third of its GDP.2Private consumption shares in other emerging Asian economies--the dashed line--are also significantly below those in the advanced economies--the dotted line--and have not moved up in the wake of the global financial crisis. Measures to boost private consumption would appear to benefit not only the global economy, but also the emerging Asian economies themselves. China and other emerging market economies have already taken some steps to promote household consumption, but the progress on this front has been slow and further measures are warranted. Indeed, at the G-20 Cannes summit, China pledged to rebalance its demand toward domestic spending through policies to bolster household income and strengthen social safety nets, and Indonesia and Korea each made similar commitments to facilitate the process of global rebalancing. What are some specific policy measures that could be helpful? First, increased public spending on social services, such as education, health care, and retirement benefits, could spur consumption by reducing the need for precautionary household saving. In China, some redistribution of the profits of state-owned enterprises to the central government through larger dividend payments could provide revenue to support such spending. Second, government support could be shifted away from manufacturing toward encouraging service-sector development, which has typically lagged behind in these economies. Services tend to have a higher non-traded component, so faster growth of this sector would help rebalance growth toward domestic demand. Third, additional development spending could be directed toward these countries' poorest regions; for example, China has recently strengthened its efforts in this area. The case for boosting investment rates in Asian emerging economies to support global demand is less clear-cut. At about 45 percent of GDP, Chinese investment rates are now so high that the return on new investment may already be quite low in some sectors. In a number of other countries, however, investment rates are only at about the average of those in the advanced economies. It seems plausible that, with their lower capital-to-labor ratios, investment rates should be higher in some emerging Asian economies. Indeed, some have argued that infrastructure needs remain extremely pronounced in many emerging market economies, and that a wave of investment may be in the offing for the world's developing economies.3With low interest rates throughout the world, this would certainly seem to be a propitious time for countries to pursue productive capital investment. Finally, exchange rate adjustments will play a crucial role in boosting emerging Asia's contribution to global demand. Indeed, the G-20 leaders welcomed China's determination to increase exchange rate flexibility and to carry out its plans to increase convertibility of the renminbi capital account. Such flexibility is crucial if Asian domestic demand is to be expanded without exacerbating inflationary pressures. Exchange rate appreciation channels demand toward foreign products, thereby creating the scope for policies to expand domestic demand without exacerbating inflationary pressures. More generally, exchange rate flexibility makes it easier for monetary policy to respond to domestic considerations and to achieve price stability. Perhaps most important, since the ultimate goal of economic growth is to improve standards of living, allowing the currency to appreciate can help ensure that a greater proportion of output is devoted to household consumption, enabling social welfare to improve at a faster pace. ConclusionTo sum up, growth in advanced nations, including the United States, faces serious headwinds. Households are still deleveraging, corporations are reluctant to invest, and fiscal consolidation is needed over time to place public finances on a sustainable course. Despite some pickup in growth in the United States during the second half of the year, the outlook is for unemployment to diminish only slowly, remaining painfully high for many years to come. These developments have also affected emerging market economies, where there are now clear signs of slowing growth. In addition, downside risks to global growth have increased significantly because of rising financial market pressures, reflecting an intensification of stress in European banking and sovereign debt markets as well as broader concerns about the outlook. These circumstances call for concerted domestic policy actions to boost growth and create jobs. Indeed, as I already noted, we at the Federal Reserve are moving vigorously to promote a stronger economic recovery. However, monetary policy is not a panacea, and it is essential for other policymakers to also do their part. In particular, there is a strong case for additional measures to address the dysfunctional housing market. Stronger housing demand has the potential to boost recovery. The Congress and the Administration also can support the recovery in the near term while simultaneously putting fiscal policy on a sustainable trajectory in the long term. As I have emphasized in this talk, there is also an urgent need for policy action from a number of countries. In Europe, forceful action is essential to address the region's fiscal and financial stresses, which pose a threat not only to growth but also to global financial stability. In addition, many emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, have the scope to bolster domestic demand. Such policies would support stronger, more balanced, and more sustainable global economic growth; they would enhance social welfare at home as well. The most profound effect of the Asian miracle of the past several decades has been to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Further actions to boost aggregate demand in Asia will ensure that this miracle is sustained. 1.I am indebted to Federal Reserve Board staff members Shaghil Ahmed, Eric Engen, William English, Joseph Gruber, Steven Kamin, Michael Leahy, Andrew Levin, Trevor Reeve, and David Wilcox for their assistance in preparing these remarks.Return to text 2.Output per capita has been growing very rapidly in China, so per capita consumption has also been rising.Return to text 3.See, for example, McKinsey Global Institute (2010).Farewell to Cheap Capital?

In Europe, forceful action is essential to address the region's fiscal and financial stresses, which pose a threat not only to growth but also to global financial stability. In addition, many emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, have the scope to bolster domestic demand. Such policies would support stronger, more balanced, and more sustainable global economic growth; they would enhance social welfare at home as well. The most profound effect of the Asian miracle of the past several decades has been to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Further actions to boost aggregate demand in Asia will ensure that this miracle is sustained. 1.I am indebted to Federal Reserve Board staff members Shaghil Ahmed, Eric Engen, William English, Joseph Gruber, Steven Kamin, Michael Leahy, Andrew Levin, Trevor Reeve, and David Wilcox for their assistance in preparing these remarks.Return to text 2.Output per capita has been growing very rapidly in China, so per capita consumption has also been rising.Return to text 3.See, for example, McKinsey Global Institute (2010).Farewell to Cheap Capital?

Vice Chair Janet L. Yellen At the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, California Good morning. I'm delighted to return "home" to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and honored to kick off the Bank's second Asia Economic Policy Conference. In my remarks this morning I will underscore the urgency of strengthened international policy cooperation to attain strong, sustainable and balanced growth in the global economy--a theme that received emphasis at the Group of Twenty (G-20) Leaders' Summit in Cannes earlier this month. The global economy is facing critical challenges. The recovery in the United States and other advanced economies has been proceeding too slowly to provide jobs for millions of unemployed people. There have also been clear signs of slowing growth in emerging market economies over the past year. In effect, we face a dearth of aggregate demand, not just among the advanced economies, but also for the global economy as a whole.1 In ordinary times, policymakers in the advanced countries would address such a demand shortfall with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. But these are no ordinary times. Central banks in a number of advanced economies, including the United States, have brought short-term interest rates close to zero, so that further monetary accommodation can be provided only through unconventional tools, such as securities purchases and forward policy guidance. Meanwhile, the scope for fiscal stimulus is limited by concerns about sizable budget deficits and longer-term sustainability. At the G-20 summit earlier this month in Cannes, the United States and other advanced economies--including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the United Kingdom--agreed to pursue fiscal consolidation plans to place public finances on a sustainable course over the medium term while sustaining the near-term recovery. Indeed, in the current environment of weak demand, near-term fiscal consolidation could threaten the economic recovery, which in turn may undermine the success of the fiscal strategy. In such circumstances, economies with the capacity to stimulate global growth‑‑namely, countries with large current account surpluses and the potential to expand domestic demand--must take a leading role in adopting policies to rebalance and sustain the global economy. This commitment was made by all of the G-20 leaders, including those from China, Indonesia, South Korea, and other emerging markets. In the remainder of my remarks, I will point out some key factors that have been restraining the pace of U.S. economic growth, and I will discuss the need for fiscal adjustments to place our federal budget on a sustainable path over the medium term without impairing the economic recovery. I will then turn to a consideration of the crucial role of the Asian economies in fostering a stronger global recovery. Of course, these remarks solely reflect my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System. U.S. Economic GrowthSince the middle of 2009, the U.S. economy has been recovering from the most severe recession and financial crisis to afflict our country since the Great Depression. However, the pace of the economic recovery has been less vigorous than desired or expected, and the unemployment rate has declined only about 1 percentage point over the past two years. Indeed, the number of jobs in the private sector remains more than 6 million below the peak level reached in early 2008--a distressing development made all the worse by the fact that new entrants have, of course, continued to come into the labor force in recent years. The fraction of those now jobless who have been without work for six months or more stands at a very high level. In addition to those officially unemployed, many individuals are involuntarily working part time or have dropped out of the labor force entirely. The pace of economic growth in the second half of this year has been somewhat faster than in the first half, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on growth earlier in the year. Nonetheless, a range of more-persistent factors also appear to be restraining the recovery. In recognition of these drags, the consensus of professional forecasters in the survey released earlier this month by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia was that unemployment would decline only slightly in the next few years, to an average rate of 8.4 percent in 2013. Moreover, financial market conditions have deteriorated, on net, in recent months, intensifying some of the headwinds facing the economy. At the onset of the financial crisis, consumer spending contracted sharply and the personal saving rate began a steep ascent.Exhibit 1shows that the saving rate rose from around 2-1/2 percent in 2006 to about 5 percent in the first half of this year. It now appears that consumer spending is advancing at a moderate pace. In the pre-crisis years, consumer spending grew rapidly, providing considerable impetus to the expansion. In contrast, over the next few years, consumer spending seems unlikely to serve as one of the main engines of growth. The ratio of household debt-to-income remains exceptionally high, even though over the past few years it has declined slightly from the post-World War II peak reached prior to the crisis. Although households appear to have made some progress in deleveraging, many still face elevated debt burdens and reduced access to credit. Moreover, high levels of unemployment and underemployment, slow gains in wages, and declines in the values of both homes and financial assets have weighed on household spending and diminished the ability of households to tap home equity in emergencies or for other purposes. Consumer sentiment dropped markedly over the summer and remains quite depressed, apparently reflecting households' concerns about the broader economy as well as their own financial situations. A sharp downturn in housing was at the core of the previous recession, and this sector continues to weigh on the recovery. Robust increases in housing activity have helped spur recoveries from most U.S. recessions since World War II. This time, in contrast, residential construction remains depressed by a large inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties either currently available for purchase or probably soon to become so, tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages, and concerns about the possibility of further declines in home prices. As a result, new home construction currently is at only about one-third of its average pace in recent decades. In addition, homeowners with insufficient equity in their homes have found it difficult to take advantage of today's low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages. Recently announced changes to the federal government's Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, are designed to improve the opportunity for homeowners to refinance and I'm hopeful this program will succeed in reducing household debt service burdens and the flow of foreclosures. More generally, I see a strong case for additional policies to foster more-rapid recovery in the housing sector. Indeed, to provide greater support for mortgage markets, the Federal Reserve recently adjusted its program for reinvesting its securities holdings. The Federal Reserve continues to provide highly accommodative monetary conditions to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Moreover, the scope remains to provide additional accommodation through enhanced guidance on the path of the federal funds rate or through additional purchases of longer-term financial assets. Challenges for U.S. Fiscal PolicyTurning now to U.S. fiscal policy, with the onset of the recent recession and financial crisis, the federal budget deficit widened significantly and has remained wide.Exhibit 2shows that, as a result, federal debt held by the public has increased relative to our national income to a level not seen in the past half-century. These budget developments have reflected both the weak economy, which has depressed revenues and pushed up expenditures, and the fiscal stimulus that was implemented to help ease the recession and support the recovery. So long as the economy continues to recover, the deficit should narrow over the next several years as a growing economy boosts revenues and reduces expenditures and as the policies put in place to provide economic stimulus continue to wind down. Even so, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) will continue to edge higher over the next decade unless the Congress and the Administration are able to agree on a program of deficit reduction that is more ambitious than the targets incorporated in last summer's Budget Control Act. Looking yet further out, it is apparent that, absent significant policy shifts, budget pressures resulting from the aging of the U.S. population and fast-rising health-care costs will continue to push the federal debt ratio higher in coming decades. The dashed line in exhibit 2 shows the Congressional Budget Office's long-term projection of the debt-to-GDP ratio through 2035 under current policy settings, including the effects of the Budget Control Act. It is crucial that the federal budget be put on a sustainable long-run trajectory, and we should not postpone charting that course. A failure to put in place a credible plan to address our long-run budget imbalance would expose the United States to serious economic costs and risks in the long term and possibly sooner. Timely enactment of a plan to put the federal budget onto a sustainable trajectory will make it easier for individuals and businesses to prepare for these adjustments. In addition, the sooner our longer-term budget problems are addressed, the less wrenching the adjustment will have to be and the more control that policymakers--rather than market forces or international creditors--will have over the timing, size, and composition of the necessary adjustments. At the same time, too much fiscal tightening in the near term could harm the economic recovery. Significant near-term reductions in federal spending or large increases in taxes would impose an additional drag on the economy at a time when aggregate demand is already weak. Indeed, under current law, federal fiscal policy is slated to impose considerable restraint on the growth of aggregate demand next year. We need, and I believe we have scope for, an approach to fiscal policy that puts in place a well-timed and credible plan to bring deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium and long terms while also addressing the economy's short-term needs. I do not underestimate the difficulty of crafting a strategy that appropriately balances short-run needs with long-run considerations, but doing so would provide important benefits to the U.S. economy. The Key Role of the Emerging Asian EconomiesIn light of the various factors weighing on aggregate demand in the United States and other advanced economies, I believe it is crucial for emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, to take further steps to boost domestic demand, providing support for their own growth and that of the global economy. Indeed, such policies are a core component of the G-20 nations' commitment to strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. Of course, emerging Asia has already made an important contribution to bolstering the global economy in the wake of the financial crisis. The top panel ofexhibit 3shows that even though the emerging Asian economies were hit quite hard by the global downturn, they recovered much more quickly than did other parts of the world. The full extent of the Asian bounceback can perhaps best be appreciated by comparing the level of output in Asia, shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit, with those in advanced economies and other emerging market economies. Asia's output level--the solid line--has increased substantially from its barely perceptible trough. Output in other emerging market economies--the dashed line--has also increased significantly. In comparison, output in the advanced economies--the dotted line--has not yet attained its pre-crisis peak. A key factor contributing to the relatively rapid recovery of the Asian emerging market economies was that, in contrast to many previous episodes of severe stress, these economies were well-positioned to permit the use of countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies. Cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances in emerging Asian economies fell noticeably in 2008 and 2009, reflecting a more expansionary fiscal stance; fiscal stimulus was particularly large in China, India, and Singapore. Monetary policy was also eased substantially throughout emerging Asia. Partly as a result of those policy measures, the growth of the emerging Asian economies over the past several years appears to have relied less on external demand from the advanced economies. The top panel ofexhibit 4shows that the shares of exports in nominal GDP in the Asian economies have trended downwards since 2006 following a decade of solid increases. However, trade balances in the region (shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit) generally remain in surplus, notwithstanding some recent narrowing in several countries. These surpluses suggest that, on balance, the Asian economies continue to add more to global supply than to global demand. Crucially, private consumption as a share of output still remains quite low in several emerging Asian economies.Exhibit 5shows that China's consumption share--the solid line--which was already well below that of other major economies in 2000, has fallen steadily over the past decade to about one-third of its GDP.2Private consumption shares in other emerging Asian economies--the dashed line--are also significantly below those in the advanced economies--the dotted line--and have not moved up in the wake of the global financial crisis. Measures to boost private consumption would appear to benefit not only the global economy, but also the emerging Asian economies themselves. China and other emerging market economies have already taken some steps to promote household consumption, but the progress on this front has been slow and further measures are warranted. Indeed, at the G-20 Cannes summit, China pledged to rebalance its demand toward domestic spending through policies to bolster household income and strengthen social safety nets, and Indonesia and Korea each made similar commitments to facilitate the process of global rebalancing. What are some specific policy measures that could be helpful? First, increased public spending on social services, such as education, health care, and retirement benefits, could spur consumption by reducing the need for precautionary household saving. In China, some redistribution of the profits of state-owned enterprises to the central government through larger dividend payments could provide revenue to support such spending. Second, government support could be shifted away from manufacturing toward encouraging service-sector development, which has typically lagged behind in these economies. Services tend to have a higher non-traded component, so faster growth of this sector would help rebalance growth toward domestic demand. Third, additional development spending could be directed toward these countries' poorest regions; for example, China has recently strengthened its efforts in this area. The case for boosting investment rates in Asian emerging economies to support global demand is less clear-cut. At about 45 percent of GDP, Chinese investment rates are now so high that the return on new investment may already be quite low in some sectors. In a number of other countries, however, investment rates are only at about the average of those in the advanced economies. It seems plausible that, with their lower capital-to-labor ratios, investment rates should be higher in some emerging Asian economies. Indeed, some have argued that infrastructure needs remain extremely pronounced in many emerging market economies, and that a wave of investment may be in the offing for the world's developing economies.3With low interest rates throughout the world, this would certainly seem to be a propitious time for countries to pursue productive capital investment. Finally, exchange rate adjustments will play a crucial role in boosting emerging Asia's contribution to global demand. Indeed, the G-20 leaders welcomed China's determination to increase exchange rate flexibility and to carry out its plans to increase convertibility of the renminbi capital account. Such flexibility is crucial if Asian domestic demand is to be expanded without exacerbating inflationary pressures. Exchange rate appreciation channels demand toward foreign products, thereby creating the scope for policies to expand domestic demand without exacerbating inflationary pressures. More generally, exchange rate flexibility makes it easier for monetary policy to respond to domestic considerations and to achieve price stability. Perhaps most important, since the ultimate goal of economic growth is to improve standards of living, allowing the currency to appreciate can help ensure that a greater proportion of output is devoted to household consumption, enabling social welfare to improve at a faster pace. ConclusionTo sum up, growth in advanced nations, including the United States, faces serious headwinds. Households are still deleveraging, corporations are reluctant to invest, and fiscal consolidation is needed over time to place public finances on a sustainable course. Despite some pickup in growth in the United States during the second half of the year, the outlook is for unemployment to diminish only slowly, remaining painfully high for many years to come. These developments have also affected emerging market economies, where there are now clear signs of slowing growth. In addition, downside risks to global growth have increased significantly because of rising financial market pressures, reflecting an intensification of stress in European banking and sovereign debt markets as well as broader concerns about the outlook. These circumstances call for concerted domestic policy actions to boost growth and create jobs. Indeed, as I already noted, we at the Federal Reserve are moving vigorously to promote a stronger economic recovery. However, monetary policy is not a panacea, and it is essential for other policymakers to also do their part. In particular, there is a strong case for additional measures to address the dysfunctional housing market. Stronger housing demand has the potential to boost recovery. The Congress and the Administration also can support the recovery in the near term while simultaneously putting fiscal policy on a sustainable trajectory in the long term. As I have emphasized in this talk, there is also an urgent need for policy action from a number of countries. In Europe, forceful action is essential to address the region's fiscal and financial stresses, which pose a threat not only to growth but also to global financial stability. In addition, many emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, have the scope to bolster domestic demand. Such policies would support stronger, more balanced, and more sustainable global economic growth; they would enhance social welfare at home as well. The most profound effect of the Asian miracle of the past several decades has been to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Further actions to boost aggregate demand in Asia will ensure that this miracle is sustained. 1.I am indebted to Federal Reserve Board staff members Shaghil Ahmed, Eric Engen, William English, Joseph Gruber, Steven Kamin, Michael Leahy, Andrew Levin, Trevor Reeve, and David Wilcox for their assistance in preparing these remarks.Return to text 2.Output per capita has been growing very rapidly in China, so per capita consumption has also been rising.Return to text 3.See, for example, McKinsey Global Institute (2010).Farewell to Cheap Capital?

The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing coordinated actions to enhance their capacity to provide liquidity support to the global financial system. The purpose of these actions is to ease strains in financial markets and thereby mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses and so help foster economic activity. These central banks have agreed to lower the pricing on the existing temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements by 50 basis points so that the new rate will be the U.S. dollar overnight index swap (OIS) rate plus 50 basis points. This pricing will be applied to all operations conducted from December 5, 2011. The authorization of these swap arrangements has been extended to February 1, 2013. In addition, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank will continue to offer three-month tenders until further notice. As a contingency measure, these central banks have also agreed to establish temporary bilateral liquidity swap arrangements so that liquidity can be provided in each jurisdiction in any of their currencies should market conditions so warrant. At present, there is no need to offer liquidity in non-domestic currencies other than the U.S. dollar, but the central banks judge it prudent to make the necessary arrangements so that liquidity support operations could be put into place quickly should the need arise. These swap lines are authorized through February 1, 2013. Federal Reserve ActionsThe Federal Open Market Committee has authorized an extension of the existing temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank through February 1, 2013. The rate on these swap arrangements has been reduced from the U.S. dollar OIS rate plus 100 basis points to the OIS rate plus 50 basis points. In addition, as a contingency measure, the Federal Open Market Committee has agreed to establish similar temporary swap arrangements with these five central banks to provide liquidity in any of their currencies if necessary. Further details on the revised arrangements will be available shortly. U.S. financial institutions currently do not face difficulty obtaining liquidity in short-term funding markets. However, were conditions to deteriorate, the Federal Reserve has a range of tools available to provide an effective liquidity backstop for such institutions and is prepared to use these tools as needed to support financial stability and to promote the extension of credit to U.S. households and businesses.

Harvard College won the eighth annual national College Fed Challenge on Tuesday. The team from Cambridge, Mass. represented the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and included Anirudha Balasubramanian, Sumit Malik, Andreas Schaab, Benjamin Sprung-Keyser, James Sun, Justin Katiraei, and faculty adviser Benjamin Friedman. The finals were held in the Board Room at the Board of Governors as the capstone to five district competitions held around the country. The other national finalists were second place Rutgers University, Newark, N.J., with honorable mentions for Albion College, Albion, Mich.; Lafayette College, Easton, Penn.; and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N.C. College Fed Challenge is a team competition for undergraduate students. Teams play the role of members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policymaking body. The competition encourages students to learn about the U.S. economy, monetary policymaking, and the role of the Federal Reserve System. The competition also aims to foster students' interest in economics and finance as fields for advanced study and careers. Teams competing in the finals gave 15-minute presentations and made a monetary policy recommendation or decision. Teams were judged on economic analysis, responses to judges' questions, teamwork, and presentation. Judges for the finals this year were Elizabeth A. Duke, member, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; Krishna Guha, executive vice president of communications, Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and John Weinberg, senior vice president and director of research, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Teams competed in their local Reserve Bank Districts, and top teams moved on to the finals in Washington, D.C.
On November 14, 2011, the Federal Reserve conducted an auction of $5 billion in 28-day term deposits through its Term Deposit Facility.

The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced that borrowers who believe they were financially harmed during the mortgage foreclosure process by four institutions in 2009 and 2010 can now request an independent review and potentially receive compensation. Four large mortgage servicers supervised by the Board--GMAC Mortgage, HSBC Finance Corporation, SunTrust Mortgage, and EMC Mortgage Corporation--are required to conduct this program as part of their compliance with enforcement actions issued by the Board in April 2011. Under these actions, servicers are required to compensate borrowers for financial injury resulting from deficiencies in their foreclosure processes. A number of servicers supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency must also conduct the program. As mandated by the Federal Reserve's enforcement actions, the four servicers were required to retain independent consultants approved by the Federal Reserve to conduct the reviews. Borrowers are eligible for a review if their primary residence was in the foreclosure process in 2009 or 2010, whether or not the foreclosure was completed. The review is intended to determine if those borrowers suffered financial harm directly resulting from errors, misrepresentations, or other deficiencies. The Federal Reserve will monitor the implementation of the program and the servicers' outreach efforts. To apply for a review, individuals may call 888-952-9105, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. (ET), and Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (ET). Individuals can get more information about the review through a website set up by the servicers,www.IndependentForeclosureReview.com. In addition, the servicers will conduct an advertising campaign and send letters to borrowers who may be eligible to participate in the review to provide information. Requests for review by the servicers' independent consultants must be received by April 30, 2012. Borrowers are encouraged to carefully consider the information about the review program to determine if they should participate. There are no costs associated with being included in the review. In addition to conducting the reviews generated by this outreach program, the independent consultants retained by the servicers supervised by the Federal Reserve will separately review all cases in certain categories of foreclosure actions by the servicers to determine whether borrowers suffered financial injury. These categories include members of the military who were in the mortgage foreclosure process in 2009 or 2010 who were covered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and borrowers who had previously filed complaints with the servicers about foreclosure actions that were pending during 2009 or 2010. Borrowers who previously filed complaints with these servicers about foreclosures pending during the review period also may seek independent reviews of their foreclosures. The enforcement actions issued by the Federal Reserve in April also require the servicers to correct other deficiencies in residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure practices going forward. Under the plans, among other things, servicers must specify a single point of contact for certain borrowers who are having difficulty paying their mortgages, ensure that foreclosures are not pursued when a borrower is performing on a loan modification, and establish robust controls and oversight over their third-party vendors. As previously stated in April, the Federal Reserve believes monetary sanctions in these cases are appropriate and plans to announce monetary penalties. These monetary penalties will be in addition to the compensation provided to borrowers in the independent review process. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced the issuance of a Consent Order of Prohibition and assessment of a Civil Money Penalty against Bryan Posey, former president and director of Security Bank, Tulsa, Oklahoma, a state member bank. The Consent Order resolved administrative charges brought by the Federal Reserve Board in April 2011. Those charges alleged that Posey had engaged in violations of law and unsafe and unsound banking practices, and breached his fiduciary duties in connection with his issuance and administration of commercial real estate and other loans. The charges also included a notice of assessment of a civil money penalty. The Consent Order requires a civil money penalty payment of $35,000. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.
The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the issuance of Consent Orders of Prohibition against Thomas B. Hebble and Angel Guerzon, former senior officers and institution-affiliated parties of Orion Bank, Naples, Florida, a former state-member bank that failed in November 2009. Hebble and Guerzon consented to the issuance of the orders, which were based on their participation in unsafe and unsound practices, breaches of fiduciary duty, and violations of law and regulation that included their participation in a series of loan transactions to uncreditworthy borrowers. The transactions were designed to make it appear, falsely, that bad loans on Orion's books had been reduced and that the bank had raised $15 million in new capital. These transactions affected the integrity of the bank's financial statements, regulatory reports, and books and records. In addition to the Board's order, Hebble and Guerzon have each pleaded guilty to criminal conspiracy charges in connection with the fraudulent loan transactions. On October 25, 2011, they were each sentenced to prison terms by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday issued a final rule requiring top-tier U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans for review. Also, the Federal Reserve launched the 2012 review, issuing instructions to the firms, including the macroeconomic and financial market scenarios the Federal Reserve is requiring institutions to use to support the stress testing used in their capital plans. As a part of the review, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve in 2012 will carry out a supervisory stress test based on the same stress scenario provided to the firms to support its analysis of the adequacy of the firms' capital. The aim of the annual capital plans, which build on the CCAR conducted earlier this year, is to ensure that institutions have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks, and to help ensure that institutions have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Institutions will be expected to have credible plans that show they have sufficient capital so that they can continue to lend to households and businesses, even under adverse conditions, and are well prepared to meet regulatory capital standards agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as they are implemented in the United States. Boards of directors of the institutions will be required each year to review and approve capital plans before submitting them to the Federal Reserve. Under the final rule, the Federal Reserve annually will evaluate institutions' capital adequacy, internal capital adequacy assessment processes, and their plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve will approve dividend increases or other capital distributions only for companies whose capital plans are approved by supervisors and are able to demonstrate sufficient financial strength to operate as successful financial intermediaries under stressed macroeconomic and financial market scenarios, even after making the desired capital distributions. In addition to issuing the final rule, the Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday issued instructions outlining the information the Federal Reserve is seeking from the firms and the analysis the Federal Reserve will do for the CCAR in 2012. There are two sets of instructions: one for the 19 firms that participated in the CCAR in 2011, the other for 12 additional firms with at least $50 billion in assets that have not previously participated in a supervisory stress test exercise. The level of detail and analysis expected in each institution's capital plan will vary based on the company's size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations. The instructions include a supervisory stress scenario that will be used by all of the firms and the Federal Reserve to analyze firms' capital needs to withstand such a scenario while continuing to act as a financial intermediary. The supervisory stress scenario is not the Federal Reserve's forecast for the economy, but is designed to represent an outcome that, while unlikely, may occur if the U.S economy were to experience a deep recession while at the same time economic activity in other major economies were also to contract significantly. For the 19 firms that participated in the CCAR in 2011, the Federal Reserve will conduct a supervisory stress test using internally developed models to generate loss estimates and post-stress capital ratios. In addition to the macroeconomic scenario provided by the Federal Reserve, the six largest firms will be required to estimate potential losses stemming from a hypothetical global market shock. The global market shock will be based on market price movements seen during the second half of 2008, a time of significant volatility, with adjustments made to incorporate potential sharp market price movements in European sovereign and financial sectors. Firms' capital adequacy, and their plans to make capital distributions, will be assessed against a number of criteria, including projected performance under the stress scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the institutions' internal scenarios. After evaluating the institutions' submissions, the Federal Reserve will publish the results of the supervisory stress tests for each of the 19 institutions including the results of the market shock for the six institutions with large trading operations. Institutions will be required to submit their capital plans by January 9, 2012. The capital planning requirements are consistent with the Federal Reserve's obligations to impose enhanced capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that economic growth strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on growth earlier in the year. Nonetheless, recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has increased at a somewhat faster pace in recent months. Business investment in equipment and software has continued to expand, but investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation appears to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets. The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further. However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September. The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. The Committee will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Richard W. Fisher; Narayana Kocherlakota; Charles I. Plosser; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was Charles L. Evans, who supported additional policy accommodation at this time.

The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced the appointment of Michael S. Gibson as director of the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, effective January 1, 2012. Gibson, a deputy director in the Board's Division of Research and Statistics with an expertise in risk management and financial markets, succeeds Patrick M. Parkinson. Parkinson is retiring after more than 30 years of service with the Board. The division develops regulatory policy and oversees the supervision of state member banks; bank, financial, and savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries; and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banking organizations. The director of the division represents the Federal Reserve on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and works closely with officials from other U.S. and international government agencies on bank oversight issues. Gibson is an economist who began his career at the Federal Reserve in 1992 in the Banking Section of the Division of International Finance. He moved to the Trading Risk Analysis Section in the Division of Research and Statistics in 1999 and was selected chief of that section in 2000. Earlier this year, Gibson was promoted to deputy director, with responsibility for the division's financial functions. Gibson represents the Basel Committee as co-chair of a working group that is developing a proposal for globally consistent margin requirements on uncleared derivatives and has also participated in a U.S. interagency group working on margin requirements for uncleared swaps. During the past several years he has coordinated the Federal Reserve staff's support for the Board's participation on the Financial Stability Board. Gibson holds a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a B.A. in economics from Stanford University. "Mike's expert knowledge of risk management and financial markets make him an excellent choice at a time when we are drawing on a wide range of expertise in bank supervision and regulation to focus not just on the health of individual institutions, but on the financial system as a whole," Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said. Parkinson joined the Board in 1980 as an economist in the Division of International Finance and served in a number of senior positions in other divisions, including in Research and Statistics and in Banking Supervision and Regulation. In those roles, he made a number of important contributions, including being a key player in the development of liquidity facilities set up by the Federal Reserve to help stabilize financial markets during the recent financial crisis. He served as an adviser to the Chairman on issues considered by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets from 1993 until 2009, when Parkinson was named the director of the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation. "Pat has been an exemplary leader, helping to build a more multidisciplinary and analytical approach to supervision and regulation, including instituting annual capital planning and stress tests for major financial institutions and helping to forge strong international agreements on bank capital through his participation on the Basel Committee," Chairman Bernanke said. "His important contributions during the past two years have added to an already distinguished career at the Federal Reserve." For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

Vice Chair Janet L. Yellen At the Fourteenth Annual International Banking Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois Let me begin by thanking the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for inviting me to participate in this important conference on the role of central banks in financial stability. As you know, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) assigned the Federal Reserve a central role in the new framework for achieving and maintaining financial stability. I am grateful for this opportunity to explain how we, together with other regulators, have been moving forward to fulfill our new responsibilities.1 The Dodd-Frank Act instituted substantial changes to financial-sector supervision and regulation in the United States in direct response to the serious deficiencies in the regulatory framework that were revealed, all too painfully, by the financial crisis and the associated deep recession. One key change was the requirement that U.S. financial regulators take a "macroprudential approach" to supervision and regulation. In my remarks today, I want to describe how this approach is being put into practice at the Federal Reserve. I will touch on both our own regulatory and supervisory responsibilities and our responsibilities as a member of the multiagency Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which the Dodd-Frank Act established to promote a more comprehensive approach to monitoring and mitigating systemic risk. I should note that an important part of putting the macroprudential approach into practice is establishing a new regulatory infrastructure, including the FSOC and its working-committee structure. In addition, individual regulatory agencies have made organizational changes needed to fulfill their new responsibilities. At the Federal Reserve, we have reoriented our supervision of large bank holding companies, and we have created a new office called the Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which plays a key role in monitoring financial risks, analyzing the implications for financial stability, and identifying approaches for mitigating identified risks. Overview of the Macroprudential ApproachThe explicit incorporation of macroprudential considerations into our structure for financial regulation and oversight represents a major innovation in our thinking about how financial stability is most effectively achieved. In contrast to the traditional, or "microprudential," approach to regulation and supervision, which focuses on the safety and soundness ofindividualfinancial institutions, markets, and infrastructures, the macroprudential approach also calls for attention to the financial systemas a whole. In particular, financial institutions are typically linked together in a complex web of relationships, and hence the sudden failure of a single institution can generate spillover effects on other firms and potentially place the entire financial system at risk. Such externalities are most evident for very large institutions and financial market utilities but may also arise within a set of small or medium-sized firms that are engaged in activities with highly correlated returns. Therefore, the macroprudential approach focuses on achieving financial stability by reducing systemic risk‑‑that is, the risk of a financial disruption that is severe enough to inflict significant damage on the broader economy. Ideally, this approach is done through preemptive policies that restrain risks to the financial system before they develop into crises. Macroprudential policies address several forms of systemic risk. One form of risk can be described as structural‑‑such as the presence of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) or systemically important payment, clearing, or settlement infrastructures or activities, whose failure or financial distress could have outsized destabilizing effects on the rest of the financial system. Another form of risk can be described as cyclical and includes, for example, elevated asset prices and excessive credit growth that arise in robust economic times but can leave the balance sheets of both large and small financial firms vulnerable to downturns in the credit cycle. Attentiveness to these various channels is critical in the monitoring of systemic risk and the formulation of appropriate macroprudential policy responses. In particular, some risks are best allayed by policies that are structural in nature and thus do not change as economic conditions evolve, whereas others are best addressed by policies that are sensitive to economic developments. Indeed, selecting the right policies to address specific forms of systemic risk is important for ensuring that reasonable risk-taking and innovation continue to take place in financial markets so as to foster broader productivity gains, economic growth, and job creation. A key question for central banks is how macroprudential policies fit together with monetary policy. The evolving‑‑though by no means settled‑‑consensus is that monetary policy is too blunt a tool to be routinely used to address cyclical risks to financial stability, and that more-targeted micro- and macroprudential tools should be used to address these risks. I agree that targeted prudential policies should be the first line of defense against threats to financial stability. However, because their effectiveness in practice is not yet proven, I would not rule out the possibility that monetary policy could be used directly to support financial stability goals, at least on the margin. Identifying and Addressing Structural Forms of Systemic RiskI want to turn now to structural sources of systemic risk and discuss how macroprudential policy can be used to mitigate them. Structural vulnerabilities may go largely unnoticed until they are exposed in financial crises‑‑and at considerable cost. Indeed, many of the regulations now being implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the international agreements relating to bank capital and liquidity standards, are a reaction to the events of 2007 through 2009. Such responses include regulations and reforms that address risks resulting from the existence of SIFIs and systemically important financial market utilities (FMUs) as well as other efforts to improve the resilience of important financial markets and infrastructure. Because the material distress or failure of a SIFI can have outsized effects on the financial sector and the real economy, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers the Federal Reserve to reduce the probability of such events through tougher prudential standards, including enhanced risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, an early remediation regime, and restrictions on activities. The act also requires the Federal Reserve to consider systemic risk effects when reviewing and ruling on applications for mergers among financial firms. In addition, to ensure that the failure of a SIFI can occur without serious damage to the financial system, the act gives the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation new tools, such as improved resolution planning by firms and an orderly liquidation authority. The act also requires centralized clearing of standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and introduces margin requirements for noncleared derivatives and other measures to strengthen the integrity and functioning of financial markets. Efforts to develop these rules have been progressing well. The Federal Reserve will soon release for comment its proposed rule on enhanced prudential standards that would apply to large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms. It also recently approved a final rule implementing the resolution plan requirement. Let me note that in these instances, as in all its rulemaking responsibilities, the Federal Reserve is attentive to aligning the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act with international agreements, such as higher capital standards and new liquidity standards for large banks and capital surcharges for the largest global SIFIs. The Federal Reserve, working with other financial regulators, has issued a number of proposed and final rules relating to such areas as the centralized clearing of derivatives, swap margin requirements, and the designation of systemically important FMUs and nonbank financial firms. The proposed rule for designating nonbank financial firms was put out for comment in October.2This rule specifies a process for designating such institutions, starting by analyzing firms that exceed a size threshold and exhibit characteristics, including excessive leverage and reliance on short-term funding, that could contribute to systemic risk if the firm were to become distressed. Less-discernible progress has been made to date, however, in addressing other key vulnerabilities that came to the fore during the financial crisis. Indeed, short-term funding markets remain an important source of structural risk. Despite some significant reforms that enhance liquidity and impose additional restrictions on portfolios, money market funds are still susceptible to liquidity constraints largely because of attributes like their rounded net asset value (NAV) feature and the low risk tolerance of their investors. Options for further reforms being considered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) include a mandatory floating NAV to mute the incentive for investors to be the first to redeem, capital buffers to allow funds to deal better with actual and potential losses while sustaining a stable NAV, and limits on redemptions both to provide more time for fund managers to address problems and to emphasize to investors that money market funds do not guarantee bank-like liquidity.3 The triparty repurchase agreement (repo) market also continues to exhibit important vulnerabilities. In particular, the settlement process for triparty repo trades continues to rely on massive amounts of intraday credit and, as a result, remains vulnerable to a decision by a clearing bank to withhold funding from a market participant in default or perceived as facing distress. The FSOC has recommended reforms to deal with these problems, and an industry task force has taken some key initial steps in that direction--for example, by coordinating the implementation of a robust confirmation process for triparty trades. But more needs to be done. Indeed, given the centrality of this market to the financial system, taking further steps to reduce its vulnerabilities should be given a high priority. In addition to addressing the unfinished business from the financial crisis, financial stability authorities and market participants need to be alert to new structures and products, not just those that caused problems in the past. New financial products‑‑for example, exchange-traded funds and collateralized commercial paper‑‑may foster more efficient intermediation, but they may also raise systemic risk if they increase the complexity and interconnectedness of the financial system. Authorities need to collect data and monitor risks associated with new products before the risks become salient. To improve the quality of financial-sector data and facilitate the analysis of data for the FSOC and its member agencies, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Office of Financial Research within the Treasury Department. The office has initiated a project to design a global classification system based on unique legal entity identifiers to identify parties to financial contracts. This system would allow market participants to better measure on a consolidated basis their counterparty risk across products and other dimensions. In addition, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission recently issued a new reporting form for hedge funds and certain other private investment funds, which will provide more information on their size, concentration, funding, and investments; this additional information should shed some valuable light on an important segment of the financial sector for which we have not had consistent data. Identifying and Addressing Cyclical Forms of Systemic RiskTurning next to cyclical forms of systemic risk, we are working to develop good measures of such risks, to monitor them on an ongoing basis, and to be aware of how they could unwind in a destabilizing way. On that score, at the Federal Reserve, we regularly monitor measures of leverage and maturity mismatch at financial intermediaries, and we look at asset valuations, underwriting standards for loans, and credit growth for signs of a credit-induced buildup of systemic risk. We also monitor various systemic risk measures for the largest banking firms. These measures capture financial market perceptions of the risk such a firm could impose on the broader financial system were it to become stressed. Such measures are based on firms' stock prices, credit default swap premiums, and stock price volatility, as well as the correlation in asset prices across firms. In addition, we use regular stress tests of the nation's largest banking organizations to evaluate the ability of these firms to withstand worse-than-expected outcomes for the economy. These tests are based on detailed confidential data about the balance sheets of the large banks and provide a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of how their financial conditions would evolve over a multiyear period if economic and financial conditions were to deteriorate. The stress tests started in 2009 with the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), and they continued with the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) in late 2010 and early 2011, in which we evaluated the capital planning processes of the firms and responded to requests to resume or increase shareholder payouts. In a couple of weeks, we will begin CCAR 2012, building on the previous CCAR, and roughly a year from now, we will conduct the annual supervisory stress tests mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank tests will involve a larger group of banking organizations than the 19 firms covered in the SCAP and will be extended to include any financial institution the FSOC designates as systemically important. As additional data are collected on significant credit exposures, stress tests may evolve into an effective way to identify linkages across systemically important institutions that could lead them to fall into financial distress at the same time. Another important element in identifying financial-sector vulnerabilities is the continued vigilance to the financial risks that might emerge in parts of the financial sector for which data are very scarce or that have developed more recently and are thus less well understood. The regulatory community has been working hard to fill these knowledge gaps. For example, in response to the need to improve the monitoring of leverage, particularly outside of the traditional banking system, the Federal Reserve instituted in 2010 a quarterly survey on dealer financing terms (the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms).4This survey collects qualitative information on the leverage that dealers provide to financial market participants in the repo and OTC derivatives markets. This information complements the data on counterparty credit exposures that supervisors collect on a confidential basis from large, complex financial institutions and higher-frequency data on liquidity profiles. In addition, the Board staff is working in the context of the flow of funds accounts to develop measures of reliance by nonfinancial businesses on nonbank, volatile sources of funds--that is, the shadow banking sector. Such measures would permit us to track this source of risk through the business cycle. Cyclical vulnerabilities seem relatively quiescent at present. Still, such vulnerabilities could easily emerge, especially once the economy starts to expand more robustly. Regulators need to look ahead and be ready to respond. A number of macroprudential policy tools could, in principle, be used to address heightened cyclical vulnerabilities‑‑some of which have been used in other countries and others that have been proposed but not yet tried. Examples of tools that have been used in other countries include time-varying caps on mortgage loan-to-value ratios and household debt-to-income ratios, which have been used in Korea and Hong Kong, and dynamic provisioning for losses by banks, which has been employed in Spain. The Basel III package of reforms that was agreed to last year includes a countercyclical capital buffer that can be imposed when excessive growth of risk-taking in credit markets results in an unacceptable level of systemic risk. Another policy that has been put forward but not yet tried is countercyclical margins and haircuts for funding contracts, as proposed by the Committee on the Global Financial System.5 Of course, U.S. policymakers will need to examine such policy tools in depth before implementing them here. As a first step, policymakers need to establish that countercyclical policy tools address cyclical vulnerabilities more effectively than simpler tools that are constant over the course of the cycle do.6In addition, in taking lessons from abroad, policymakers need to be aware of institutional differences that may prevent tools from having the same effects in the United States as they do elsewhere. A further issue is that the literature on the efficacy of macroprudential tools in limiting the buildup of cyclical systemic risks is still at an early stage. Even for policies that have been used in other countries, the number of papers that evaluate their effectiveness is relatively small, and isolating the effect of a specific policy amid an array of economic and financial developments is a persistent challenge. Nonetheless, these papers are encouraging‑‑at least to the further consideration of the use of cyclical policy tools‑‑and this literature, which also includes more theoretical analyses of such policies, is a vibrant and growing one that should yield useful insights in coming years.7 Current ChallengesLet me finish with a few words about current challenges to financial stability. In particular, concerns about European fiscal and banking issues have contributed to strains in global financial markets that pose significant downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook. U.S. banking institutions have manageable levels of direct exposure to the peripheral European countries but more substantial links to financial institutions in the larger European economies. In addition, some major European banks that obtain appreciable short-term wholesale U.S. dollar funding from U.S. money market funds appear to be facing significant funding pressures. In light of such international linkages, further intensification of financial disruptions in Europe could lead to a deterioration of financial conditions in the United States. The European rescue package announced in late October indicates a strong commitment by European leaders to address the issues stemming from sovereign debt. The package was a step in the right direction, but many details of the plan were unclear, and the measures would require rigorous implementation. The continued rise in sovereign debt spreads for some countries, more generalized market volatility, and political turmoil that we have seen in recent days speak to the need for forceful action to stabilize the situation. We, along with other supervisors, are actively engaged in ensuring that U.S. financial institutions are appropriately managing their credit and liquidity risks. To limit the spread of funding stresses, we have in place dollar liquidity swap lines with a number of foreign central banks. We are monitoring European developments very closely, and we will continue to do all that we can to mitigate the consequence of any adverse developments abroad on the U.S. financial system. ConclusionThe Federal Reserve and other U.S. financial regulators have accomplished a great deal since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted a little more than a year ago. We have put into practice an institutional framework for undertaking a macroprudential approach to supervision and regulation, and we have implemented processes for identifying and responding to sources of systemic risk. However, much remains to be done, including further work to close the gaps in the data coverage of the financial sector and to deepen our understanding of the effectiveness of different policy tools. The bottom line is that developing an effective macroprudential policy is critical to preserving financial stability and supporting overall U.S. economic activity. Accomplishing this objective will be a considerable challenge, but it is one of great importance. 1.I am indebted to Federal Reserve Board staff membersRochelle Edge, Andrea Kusko,Andrew Levin, andNellie Liangfor their assistance in preparing these remarks, which reflect my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.Return to text 2.See Financial Stability Oversight Council (2011),"Authority to Require Supervision and Regulation of Certain Nonbank Financial Companies" (PDF),second notice of proposed rulemaking and proposed interpretive guidance (FR Doc. 2011-26783),Federal Register, vol. 76 (October 18), pp. 64264-83.Return to text 3.Box D of the FSOC 2011 annual report provides a fuller discussion of the financial-sector vulnerabilities implied by money market funds.

Governor Daniel K. Tarullo At the Clearing House Business Meeting and Conference, New York, New York A little over three years ago, Lehman Brothers ignited the dry tinder of a badly overleveraged financial system that was too dependent on continuous, significant increases in housing prices and too opaque for supervisors, investors, analysts, and often participants themselves to understand. As one would expect of a truly systemic crisis, there were many contributing factors--the prevailing statutory framework for financial regulation, supervisory practices, and the risk-management practices of financial actors. And, as one would thus expect, the reform agenda has itself also been multi-dimensional. For all the regulatory changes that are in place, in process, or under consideration, however, I believe that capital regulation remains the single most important element of prudential financial regulation. Let me immediately elaborate upon that statement in two ways. First, capital regulation itself must be multi-dimensional and rigorous in each of its components. Second, while strong capital regulation is necessary for a sound financial system, it is not, on its own, sufficient. In my remarks this afternoon, I will concentrate on the first of these points and discuss how capital regulation reform is evolving in the wake of the crisis. Evolution and Shortcomings of Capital RegulationAlthough they had long used bank capital ratios as a supervisory instrument, U.S. bank regulators did not impose explicit minimum capital requirements until the 1980s. The proximate reason for this change was regulatory concern over the decline in capital ratios of the largest banks--a concern reinforced by Congress, as it saw some of those large banks facing enormous losses on their loans to foreign sovereigns. Within a few years this U.S. regulatory innovation was effectively internationalized by the original Basel Accord. At the same time, regulators came to regard capital requirements as a supple prudential tool. As activity and affiliation restrictions were loosened in the United States, capital requirements seemed a promising way to protect the public's interest in the stability of financial institutions that had access to the Federal Reserve's discount window and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance. Capital requirements promised to provide a buffer against bank losses fromanyactivities in which the bank or its affiliates might engage, a consideration of equal or greater relevance in countries with universal banking models. Some support also developed for the proposition that minimum capital levels could, by maintaining a material equity value for the bank, serve as a disincentive for excessive risk-taking by management and shareholders. In the ensuing quarter century, banking regulators around the world focused considerable attention toward elaborating capital requirements to reflect more precisely the particular risks faced by a financial institution. Capital requirements had, to a considerable extent, become the dominant prudential regulatory tool. The financial crisis showed that this concentrated, almost all-consuming regulatory focus on refining bank capital requirements in Basel II had come at the expense of attention to other risks in the financial system. In particular, banking regulators failed to appreciate fully the implications of the growth--in size, leverage, and maturity transformation levels--of the shadow banking system for the balance sheets of commercial banks and for overall financial stability. The crisis showed that liquidity problems can be an independent source of severe stress, perhaps even for firms that might otherwise have remained solvent. But it was also evident that the specifics of pre-crisis capital regulation fell far short of what this prudential instrument can achieve. The Basel I and Basel II capital requirements relied almost exclusively on capital ratios that were essentially snapshots of balance sheets and thus all too often a lagging indicator of a bank's condition. Declines in asset values--particularly of non-traded assets--were often not reflected in capital calculations for some time. Though already well-known before the crisis, this phenomenon was particularly problematic as asset values declined rapidly, causing both markets and supervisors alike to regard regulatory capital ratios as providing only limited information about a firm's current financial condition. In addition, minimum capital levels had simply been set too low, in general and with respect to particular assets. One of the most obvious examples was the capital requirement for asset-backed securities in the trading books of banks. The requirement was based on returns over a 10-day holding period, used a one-year observation period that had been characterized by unusually low price volatility, and did not adequately account for the credit risks inherent in these traded instruments. Furthermore, at least some of the instruments that qualified as "Tier 1 capital" for regulatory purposes were not reliable buffers against losses, at least not on a going concern basis. It is instructive that during the height of the crisis, counterparties and other market actors looked almost exclusively to the amount of tangible common equity held by financial institutions in evaluating the creditworthiness and overall stability of those institutions. They essentially ignored the Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios in regulatory requirements. In the fall of 2008, there was widespread doubt in markets that the common equity of some of our largest institutions was sufficient to withstand the losses that those firms appeared to be facing. This doubt made investors and counterparties increasingly reluctant to deal with those firms, contributing to the severe liquidity strains that characterized financial markets at the time. Finally, the crisis validated the concerns expressed by some academics and by policy staff at the Bank for International Settlements that the effectiveness of capital regulation was limited by its exclusively microprudential focus. Capital requirements had been set with reference solely to the balance sheet of a specific firm. The risk weights assigned to the firm's assets were calculated with reference to ordinary times, whether through a supervisory determination or a combination of supervisory formulas and a firm's own modeling. This microprudential focus did not take into account the potential impact of a shock to the value of widely-held assets--whether exogenous, caused by the distress sales of such assets by a large firm suffering particularly severe problems, or, as in the financial crisis, a lethal interaction between these two factors. The limits of the microprudential approach were particularly evident with respect to very large, interconnected firms. There would be very substantial negative externalities associated with the disorderly failure of any such firm, distinct from the costs incurred by the firm and its stakeholders. The failure of one large firm, especially in a period of stress, significantly increases the chances that other financial firms will fail, for two reasons. First, direct counterparty impacts can lead to a classic domino effect. Second, because losses in a tail event are much more likely to be correlated for firms deeply engaged in trading, structured products, and other capital market instruments, all such firms are vulnerable to accelerating losses as troubled firms sell their assets into a declining market. Reform of Capital Regulation in the Post-Crisis PeriodIt is obvious that the post-crisis regulatory system will not be as dependent on capital requirements as the pre-crisis regime. Dodd-Frank itself is testimony to this fact, as are a number of changes already made by the bank regulatory agencies. There is now increased emphasis on market discipline, liquidity regulation, activities restrictions, and more effective supervision, in addition to capital requirements. Reforms for money market funds and the triparty repo market, as well as more general attention to wholesale funding models for financial intermediation, are still needed. But the crisis reinforces the point that robust capital requirements should continue to be a central component of the financial regulatory system. The U.S. banking agencies made reform of the capital regime a high priority. In response to the shortcomings of the pre-crisis capital regulatory regime, there have been three complementary threads of reform. First is improvement of the traditional, individual-firm approach to capital regulation. This strand mostly originates in the work of the Basel Committee. Basel 2.5 revised and strengthened the market risk requirements of Basel II. Basel III upgraded the quality and increased the quantity of minimum capital requirements, created a capital conservation buffer, and introduced an international leverage ratio requirement. Second is the introduction of a macroprudential component of capital regulation. Although Basel III does contain a few features responsive to macroprudential concerns, it remains principally microprudential. This second thread is linked both to the requirement in section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act for enhanced risk-based capital standards for large bank holding companies and to the Basel Committee's effort to develop a framework for the assessment of a capital surcharge based on the global systemic importance of the largest, most interconnected banking organizations. Third is establishment of regular stress testing and capital planning. These complementary supervisory tools serve two related functions. First, they make capital regulation more forward-looking by subtracting losses in asset values and earnings estimated to be sustained in an adverse macroeconomic scenario, in order to determine whether firms would have enough capital to remain viable financial intermediaries. Second, they contribute to the macroprudential dimension of capital regulation by examining simultaneously the risks of all large financial institutions in the face of the adverse scenario. This reform thread is sourced in the Dodd-Frank requirement for stress testing at large banks, but more generally in the Federal Reserve's establishment of a formal annual capital planning requirement for these firms. The development and implementation of these three threads of capital reform are at different stages, so it may be useful to review where each stands. As to the first--improving the traditional, individual-firm approach to capital regulation--Basel 2.5 and Basel III are important steps forward, both internationally and domestically. In addition, the so-called "Collins amendment" in Dodd-Frank requires that banking organizations maintain capital at levels no lower than those set by "generally applicable" requirements, which include a standardized approach to risk-weighting. In practice, the Collins amendment provides a safeguard against declines in minimum capital requirements in a capital regime based on internal modeling. The Basel Committee completed work on Basel 2.5 and Basel III in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Implementation of these two frameworks into national legislation or regulations is underway in the jurisdictions represented on the committee.1 Two issues concerning implementation in the United States bear mentioning. First, while U.S. bank regulatory agencies have published a proposed regulation for the new market risk capital requirements, we did not include the trading book securitization and resecuritization portions of Basel 2.5, which are supposed to take effect in 2011. The complication here, and with part of Basel III implementation, lies in the use of agency credit ratings. Dodd-Frank requires the removal of agency credit ratings from all regulations throughout the government. Thus, the banking agencies have had to develop substitutes for agency ratings in each of the quite different contexts in which they are used within the capital standards. This has not been the easiest of tasks, but I believe we are now close to convergence on the approaches we will take in fashioning these substitutes. We should soon be able to draft a proposed regulation for the rest of Basel 2.5. Work on the Basel III rule has had to compete for staff time with all the other rulemakings currently underway at the banking agencies, but I would expect a proposed regulation in the first quarter of 2012. The second issue pertains to the six-year transition period for Basel III, which by its terms phases in the requirements for both the improved quality and increased quantity of capital in somewhat backloaded stages beginning in January 2013. Questions have arisen as to supervisory expectations for capital levels during this rather lengthy period. Specifically, there has been some uncertainty as to whether supervisors intend to "pull forward" the various transition points outlined in Basel III. While the Federal Reserve intends to ensure that firms are on a steady path to full Basel III compliance, we do not intend to require firms to raise external capital or to reduce their risk-weighted assets in order to meet any new requirement earlier than at the time specified in the Basel III transition schedule. However, because this issue is complicated somewhat both by certain expectations stated in Basel III and by the relationship of Basel III implementation to the Federal Reserve's requirement for annual capital planning by certain large bank holding companies, it may be useful to provide some further details on our expectations. In the first place, the Federal Reservewillrequire bank holding companies that are subject to our proposed capital plan rule (generally companies with $50 billion or more in total assets) to take affirmative steps to improve capital ratios, such as external capital raises, when those steps would be needed to meet each Basel III transition target on time. Next, it is important to note a statement made by the Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS)--the oversight body of the Basel Committee--in announcing agreement on Basel III in September 2010. The GHOS said that banks should "maintain prudent earnings retention policies" so as to meet both the new minimum equity standard and the conservation buffer "as soon as reasonably possible."2In the spirit of that statement, we will expect large bank holding companies that have not yet met the fully phased-in Basel III requirements (including any expected capital surcharge for globally systemically important banks) to improve their capital ratios steadily during the transition period through prudent earnings retention policies, even if they already meet any applicable intermediate targets. In practical terms, we will monitor their progress through the annual capital planning exercise, about which I shall have more to say a bit later in these remarks. We will be comfortable with proposed capital distributions only when we are convinced they are consistent with a bank holding company readily and without difficulty meeting the new capital requirements as they come into effect. Turning now to the second thread of capital regulation reform, the introduction of a capital requirement keyed to the systemic importance of financial firms, I am sure you are all aware that last Friday the Basel Committee released its framework for calibrating capital surcharges for banks of global systemic importance. This initiative is consistent with the Federal Reserve's obligation under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act to impose more stringent capital standards on systemically important financial institutions, including the requirement that these additional standards be graduated based on the systemic importance of the bank. Both the Dodd-Frank provision and the Basel framework are informed by the fact that the failure of a systemically important firm would have substantially greater negative consequences on the financial system than the failure of other firms, even quite sizeable ones. Yet obviously such a firm has no incentive to take account of these negative externalities. An ancillary rationale is that additional capital requirements could help offset any funding advantage derived from the perceived status of such institutions as too-big-to-fail. The surcharge attempts to reduce the chances of a global systemically important bank's (G-SIB's) failure so as to bring the expected impact of the failure of such a firm--that is, the expected damage to the system upon its failure discounted by the possibility that it will, in fact, fail--more in line with that of other sizeable firms. Moreover, the metrics for determining G-SIB status are heavily weighted toward the kind of interconnectedness features that pose macroprudential risks. The framework includes a range of surcharges in the 1.0-2.5 percent range for what will likely be a global group of about 30 banks, to be phased in as an expansion of the Basel III capital conservation buffer from 2016 to 2019. For illustrative purposes, the Basel Committee used 2009 data to generate a list of banks that were of global systemic importance and, based on the criteria developed from that data, a hypothetical set of "buckets" associated with the different surcharge rates. It is important to note, however, that this list, which was published last week, will not be used to determine any bank's surcharge. The list of banks to be covered and the surcharge buckets into which they will be placed when the surcharge begins to take effect in 2016 will be based upon data collected in 2014. This is as it should be, since the inclusion and ordering of the firms should be based upon the characteristics of the banks as they have evolved closer to the effective date. Some banks have changed their profiles materially in the past couple of years, and the prospect of capital surcharges may be an incentive for others to do so as well. In this regard, I should also note that the bucket allocation of each G-SIB will be recomputed in each year after 2016. The use of more up-to-date data means that banks will not know for some time exactly which buckets they will occupy when the surcharge first phases in. However, the potential uncertainty associated with this approach should be substantially reduced by the plan to publish an updated list of the covered financial institutions each November, along with an indication of the bucket to which each firm would have been allocated based on data from the preceding year. The Basel Committee will release by the latter part of 2014 additional information relevant to the surcharges that will be applied beginning in 2016--the thresholds for each surcharge "bucket" and the denominator reflecting the universe of global banking institutions against which each G-SIB will be measured. To further advance the goals of transparency and predictability, we will continue to work within the Basel Committee to ensure that the indicators used to determine the systemic-risk ranking of a firm are clear and based upon publicly available information sources. If additional information is needed by firms to allow for effective capital planning, the Basel Committee should be prepared to develop and release additional guidance. Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve to impose more stringent capital requirements on all bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, not just the U.S. firms that are on the list of G-SIBs and will thus have capital surcharges. No decision has yet been made as to whether the more stringent capital requirement to be applied to firms other than those on the eventual list of G-SIBs will be in the form of a surcharge. However, analysis of the systemic footprints of other U.S. bank holding companies suggests that even if surcharges were to apply, their amounts would be quite modest, at least based on current characteristics of the other bank holding companies. The third thread of reform in capital regulation is the establishment of regular stress testing and capital planning. Unlike the first two threads, there is no international framework that parallels our domestic changes, though stress testing is receiving increased attention in a number of other jurisdictions. These reforms build on the stress test we performed at the height of the financial crisis in early 2009, which used an adverse macroeconomic scenario and estimates of firm revenues and potential losses on a portfolio-specific basis to calculate the amount of capital that each firm would need to remain a viable financial intermediary even were the adverse scenario to materialize. The test was thus both forward-looking and horizontal, meaning that the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies were assessed in a simultaneous, consistent fashion. Dodd-Frank creates two kinds of stress testing requirements. First, it mandates that the Federal Reserve Board conduct annual stress tests on all bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in assets to determine whether they have the capital needed to absorb losses in baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic conditions. Second, it requires both these companies and certain other regulated financial firms with between $10 billion and $50 billion in assets to conduct internal stress tests. The Board must both publish a summary of results of the supervisory stress tests and issue regulations requiring firms to publish a summary of the company-run stress tests. Those who participated in the 2009 exercise, both at the banks and at regulatory agencies, know that the resource demands associated with it were considerable. Yet the value of that effort was also considerable, a fact that doubtless informed the Congressional decision to make the practice mandatory. The exercise itself forces supervisors to focus on the nature and extent of potential sources of loss for the largest bank holding companies as a group. The disclosure of stress test results allows investors and other counterparties to better understand the profiles of each institution. And, I believe, the demands of supervisors for well-specified data and projections from firms has improved risk management at these institutions. We will be implementing the specific stress testing requirements of Dodd-Frank over the next year. However, in the interim we are using a modified form of stress testing as part of the annual capital planning process we have established for large bank holding companies. This process goes well beyond a stress testing exercise. It requires firms to project their capital needs and plans on a firm-specific basis, as well as with reference to more standardized stress scenarios. It also allows us to review the safety and soundness of the firm's capital position, including any plans it has for distributions of capital. As you will recall, in the absence of such a capital review, some companies engaged in ill-advised, inappropriate capital distributions in the period immediately preceding the financial crisis, leaving them less able to absorb the losses that ensued. We conducted a capital plan review early this year for the 19 firms that had been involved in the 2009 stress test. In just a few weeks, we will begin the 2012 review. This process integrates stress testing and decisions about capital adequacy and possible capital distributions. It also gives supervisors insight into the risk measurement and risk management capabilities of the firms. We are close to issuing a final regulation that will contain the basic structure for this annual exercise. The rule would extend this formal capital planning to all bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in assets. The comments received on the proposed regulation issued in June have been useful in crafting the final rule. I expect that the final rule would, among other things, respond to the concern of some firms that the timing of the first capital planning process did not provide for appropriate capital distributions in the first quarter of the succeeding calendar year. Clarifications of some other issues that arose in the 2011 capital review will be addressed in the documentation for the 2012 exercise--such as describing with more specificity what constitutes the kind of material change in the risks faced by a firm, such that a supplemental capital plan would be needed during the course of the year. It is important to note that the capital planning process, including the stress testing component, provides supervisors with the opportunity to determine whether banking organizations need to maintain capital ratios above the minimum levels specified in the various Basel frameworks as implemented into U.S. law. Institution-specific capital measures of this sort are explicitly contemplated in the Basel arrangements, in U.S. legislation, and in the regulations of U.S. banking agencies. During the financial crisis, we used our safety-and-soundness authority to require banks to hold sufficient capital to weather the impact of the crisis and the serious recession that followed. Similarly, our annual capital plan review is a forward-looking exercise that, in estimating losses and reduced revenues that would follow an adverse economic scenario, may result in requiring banks to maintain more capital than would a static, backward-looking snapshot of minimum capital levels. ConclusionOn a number of previous occasions, I have noted that, for all the disagreement over the right set of financial reform measures, on one point there is near unanimity: No one wants another TARP program. Not those who thought TARP was the best of a bad set of options in the fall of 2008. Certainly not those who opposed it. Not the American people, many of whom saw the injection of billions of dollars of government capital into financial firms as more a bail-out of large banks than an imperative to stabilize the financial system. And not even, I suspect, most of the large financial firms that received the government capital. Each of what I have characterized as the three threads of capital regulation reform is still in development. Domestically, there are notice-and-comment rulemakings still to be done in each area. Internationally, the Basel Committee will continue work on the indicators used in its capital surcharge methodology and, of course, has yet to finalize the list of systemically important banks and the assignment of those banks to the various surcharge buckets. In both arenas it is important to move as quickly as feasible to complete all this work, so as to provide more clarity to banks, markets, and the public on the details of capital requirements, while still ensuring that the final regulations and requirements are well-crafted. But if details are still lacking, the direction of these reforms is now clear. When fully implemented, these reform strands together will increase significantly the safety and soundness of the financial system and make much less likely the need for some future TARP. At a time when there is considerable disagreement over the best direction for many aspects of financial regulation, that result is one I suspect commands broad support among policymakers, policy analysts, and the public. 1.Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2011),Progress Report on Basel III Implementation (59 KB PDF)(Bank for International Settlements: Basel, Switzerland, October).Return to text 2.See Bank for International Settlements (2010),"Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision Announces Higher Global Minimum Capital Standards,"press release, September 12.Return to text

Governor Daniel K. Tarullo At the American Bar Association Banking Law Committee Fall Meeting, Washington, D.C. Long before the recent financial crisis, banking regulation had acquired an important international dimension. The crisis renewed attention to the interconnectedness among national financial markets. In its aftermath, accordingly, the international focus on banking regulation has grown even more extensive. Today I will discuss three subjects germane to the increasingly significant international regulatory agenda. First are the steps needed to complete the reform agenda on capital and liquidity standards, including some implementation issues in the United States. Second are areas that I believe should be priorities for international work in 2012--cross-border resolution of financial firms, wholesale funding markets, and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives reform. And third are some institutional changes that will be required in the relevant international bodies to assure that they fulfill their promise of promoting a safe and efficient international financial system. Before turning to these topics, I think it important to state the goals that should inform U.S. involvement in international financial regulatory efforts. In recognition of the fact that financial distress can quickly and dramatically cross national borders, we seek to protect our own financial system by promoting the adoption of strong, common regulatory standards and effective supervisory practices for large financial firms and important financial market infrastructures around the world. Such standards and practices can also help prevent major competitive disadvantage for U.S. firms. Completing the Agenda on Minimum Capital and Liquidity StandardsStrong capital and liquidity standards are central to these goals and to the overall reform agenda for financial regulation. The crisis showed that liquidity problems can be an independent source of severe stress, perhaps even for firms that might otherwise have remained solvent. But it also confirmed that capital standards themselves had been wholly inadequate in a number of respects: Required capital levels were much too low, particularly trading book capital requirements. In evaluating the condition of financial firms at the height of the crisis, markets focused on common equity ratios and virtually ignored the Tier 1 ratio enshrined by Basel I and Basel II. Moreover, markets and supervisors both used a much more forward-looking capital calculation than under prevailing regulatory requirements--subtracting losses that they estimated would be sustained in an adverse scenario to determine whether firms would have enough capital to remain viable financial intermediaries. Finally, the significant interconnectedness among globally active firms, and the high degree of correlation in their assets, underscored the vulnerability of the entire international financial system to the potential failure of these firms. In response to these revealed regulatory shortcomings, the Basel Committee has announced four sets of changes to minimum prudential standards for internationally active banks: First, in 2009 it revised and strengthened the market risk requirements of Basel II, in what has become known as Basel 2.5. Second, last year it issued Basel III, which improved the quality and increased the quantity of minimum capital requirements, created a capital conservation buffer, and introduced an international leverage ratio requirement. Third, and coincident with Basel III, the committee issued a framework for quantitative liquidity requirements. Fourth, it has just today released the rules text of its assessment methodology for determining an additional capital requirement for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs)--popularly referred to as a "capital surcharge." In the Basel Committee itself, work on Basel 2.5 and Basel III has been essentially complete for some time. As reported recently by the committee,1implementation of Basel2.5 and Basel III into national legislation or regulations is at various stages of progress around the world. Two points are worth making with respect to U.S. implementation. First, while U.S. bank regulatory agencies have published a proposed regulation for the new market risk capital requirements, we did not include the trading book securitization and resecuritization portions of Basel 2.5. The complication here, and with part of Basel III implementation, lies in the use of agency credit ratings. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the removal of agency credit ratings from all regulations throughout the government. The banking agencies thus need to develop substitutes for agency ratings in each of the quite different contexts within the capital standards where they are used. This has not been the easiest of tasks, but I believe we are now close to convergence on the approaches we will take in fashioning these substitutes. Thus we should soon be able to draft a proposed regulation for the rest of Basel 2.5. Work on the Basel III rule has had to compete for staff time with all the other rulemakings currently underway at the banking agencies, but I would expect a proposed regulation in the first quarter of 2012. My second point pertains to the six-year transition period for Basel III, which by its terms phases in the requirements for both the improved quality and increased quantity of capital in somewhat backloaded stages beginning in January 2013. Questions have arisen--particularly here in the United States, though elsewhere as well--as to supervisory expectations for capital levels during this rather lengthy period. Specifically, there has been some uncertainty as to whether supervisors intend to "pull forward" the various transition points outlined in Basel III. While the Federal Reserve intends to ensure that firms are on a steady path to full Basel III compliance, we do not intend to require firms to raise external capital or reduce their risk-weighted assets in order to meet any target earlier than at the time specified in the Basel III transition schedule. However, because this issue is complicated somewhat both by certain expectations stated in Basel III and by the relationship of Basel III implementation to the Federal Reserve's requirement for annual capital planning by certain large bank holding companies, I think it may be useful to provide some further details on our expectations. In the first place, the Federal Reservewillrequire bank holding companies that are subject to our proposed capital plan rule (generally companies with $50 billion or more in total assets) to take affirmative steps to improve capital ratios, such as external capital raises, when those steps would be needed to meet each BaselIII transition target on time. Next, I would remind everyone of a statement made by the Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS)--the oversight body of the Basel Committee--in announcing agreement on Basel III in September 2010. The GHOS said that banks should "maintain prudent earnings retention policies" so as to meet both the new minimum equity standard and the conservation buffer "as soon as reasonably possible."2In the spirit of that statement, we will expect large bank holding companies that have not yet met the fully phased-in Basel III requirements (including any expected G-SIB capital surcharge) to improve their capital ratios steadily during the transition period through prudent earnings retention policies, even if they already meet any applicable intermediate targets. In practical terms, we will monitor their progress through our review of the capital plans that we require large bank holding companies to submit annually. That is, we will be comfortable with proposed capital distributions only when we are convinced they are consistent with a bank holding company readily and without difficulty meeting the new capital requirements as they come into effect. We will provide more detail on this point in a few weeks when we issue guidance and instructions for the 2012 capital review. Last, it is important to note that supervisors may require banking organizations to increase capital ratios above the minimum levels specified in Basel I and II for a variety of safety and soundness reasons. Institution-specific measures of this sort are explicitly contemplated in both Basel II and U.S. banking regulations. During the financial crisis, we used our safety and soundness authority to require banks to hold sufficient capital to weather the impact of the crisis and the serious recession that followed. Similarly, our annual capital plan review is a forward-looking exercise that, in estimating losses and reduced revenues that would follow an adverse economic scenario, may result in requiring banks to maintain more capital than would a static snapshot of minimum capital levels. Unlike the Basel 2.5 and Basel III capital standards, the quantitative liquidity framework requires further work in the Basel Committee. The committee has developed two complementary liquidity requirements: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) was designed to promote short-term liquidity resiliency of firms, while the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was directed at medium-term structural liquidity mismatches. The framework presented to the GHOS in 2010 was genuinely pathbreaking, in that it was the first effort ever to establish quantitative liquidity requirements. Precisely because of the novelty of this exercise, questions were raised in the GHOS as to how the definition and calibration of the new ratios aligned with actual experience in the crisis, and whether the ratios might result in some adverse unintended consequences on financial markets. Consequently, the GHOS agreed to delay implementation of both standards and provide for what were termed "observation periods," during which further analysis will be done and changes very likely made. Here, though, it is important to draw a distinction between the two standards. In recognition of the fact that the NSFR needs considerable work, which is not yet under way, it is not scheduled to become effective until 2018. The LCR, on the other hand, will go into effect in 2015. The Basel Committee has recently agreed to accelerate its review of the LCR so as to be able to make changes well before that date and, thereby, give firms and markets ample time to prepare and, as necessary, adjust. In the coming months, the Federal Reserve, after consulting with the other U.S. banking agencies, will be making recommendations for changes in the LCR. We have not yet finished developing those recommendations, but I expect that we will, among other things, suggest recalibration of certain deposit run-off and commitment draw-down rates, as well as modification of the buffer definition to place a greater focus on the liquidity characteristics of assets, as opposed to such things as the credit ratings associated with the assets. We are also examining how the regulations might be best applied during liquidity stress events to maximize the benefits for financial stability. Several other possible changes are also under consideration, including altering the LCR so as to limit certain arbitrage opportunities that appear possible from its current structure. Finally, let me turn to the Basel Committee's framework for calibrating capital surcharges for banks of global systemic importance. It is informed by the fact that failure of a systemically important firm would have substantially greater negative consequences on the financial system than the failure of other firms, even quite sizeable ones. Thus, the surcharge attempts to reduce the chances of a G-SIB's failure so as to bring the expected impact of failure of such a firm--that is, its expected damage to the system upon failure discounted by the possibility that it will, in fact, fail--more in line with that of other sizeable firms. Moreover, the metrics for determining G-SIB status are heavily weighted toward the kind of interconnectedness features that pose macroprudential risks. This framework includes a range of surcharges in the 1.0-2.5 percent range for what will likely be a global group of about 30 banks, to be phased in as an expansion of the Basel III capital conservation buffer from 2016 to 2019. The framework is consistent with the obligation of the Federal Reserve under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act to impose more stringent capital standards on systemically important institutions, including the requirement that these additional standards be graduated based on the systemic importance of the bank. For illustrative purposes, the Basel Committee used 2009 data to generate a list of banks that were of global systemic importance and, based on the criteria developed from that data, a hypothetical set of "buckets" associated with the different surcharge rates. It is important to note, however, that this list will not be used to determine any bank's surcharge. The list of banks to be covered and the buckets within which they will be placed when the surcharge begins to take effect in 2016 will be based upon data collected in 2014. This is as it should be, since the inclusion and ordering of the firms should be based upon the characteristics of the banks as they have evolved closer to the effective date. Some banks have changed their profiles materially in the past couple of years, and the prospect of capital surcharges may be an incentive for others to do so as well. In this regard, I should also note that the bucket allocation of each G-SIB will be recomputed in each year after 2016. The use of more up-to-date data means that banks will not know for some time exactly which buckets they will occupy when the surcharge first phases in. The Basel Committee does plan to release by the latter part of 2014 the thresholds for each surcharge "bucket," as well as the denominator reflecting the universe of global banking institutions against which each G-SIB will be measured. To further advance the goals of transparency and predictability, we will continue to work within the Basel Committee to ensure that the indicators used to determine the systemic risk ranking of a firm are clear and based upon publicly available information sources. If additional information is needed by firms to allow for effective capital planning, the Basel Committee should be prepared to develop and release additional guidance. Next Steps for the Reform AgendaAs I stated earlier, strong capital and liquidity standards are central to an effective financial regulatory system. Well-crafted capital standards provide a buffer against loss from any activities of a bank, while good liquidity standards help provide assurance that a firm will have breathing space during a period of financial stress, whether idiosyncratic or systemic. But we cannot rely solely on these standards, important as they are, to provide a stable financial system. Basel 2.5, Basel III, and the G-SIB surcharges can only reduce the chances of highly disruptive failure, not eliminate them. A necessary supplement is a strong resolution mechanism for systemically important firms, both to counter too-big-to-fail perceptions and to contain the harm to the financial system that would be caused by the failure of one of these firms. Thus, my first candidate for a priority area of work in 2012 is to take concrete steps to advance the useful analytic work that has been done in the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) on the resolution of financial firms with substantial international presence. Here in the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for an orderly liquidation process. Some other jurisdictions have, or are planning to, put in place comparable special- resolution mechanisms. But the co-existence of internationally active firms with nationally based insolvency regimes means that there can be potentially important transborder legal complications when a home jurisdiction places into receivership a firm with significant assets, subsidiaries, and contractual arrangements in other countries. A comprehensive, treaty-like instrument for a global bank resolution regime is almost surely not achievable in the foreseeable future, and perhaps well beyond that. But there should be room for more limited cooperation agreements, coordinated supervisory work on resolution plans, and other devices to make the orderly resolution of a large internationally active firm more feasible. Similarly, the limits of even well-conceived liquidity requirements suggest a second item that warrants attention in international fora--namely, the problems connected with wholesale funding channels over the last several years. Broadly speaking, threats to financial stability can arise in two ways: first, through the rapid deterioration or failure of a large institution with leverage sufficient to produce widespread knock-on effects and, second, through the breakdown of a significant market in which large numbers of leveraged actors depend upon similar sources of liquidity and backup liquidity. While these two sources of systemic risk can be, and usually are, related, the latter has not been the subject of the broad reform agenda directed at the former. You will note that the Basel III liquidity standards do not require global banks to reduce their usage of wholesale funding; instead, they require a bank that uses more volatile funding sources to hold more liquid assets. This requirement is critical to a sounder financial system, to be sure, but it does not address completely the potential instability associated with wholesale funding--even in the regulated institutions subject to these requirements, much less in the rest of the financial system. We will need further measures if we are to mitigate the risks of runs seen in 2007-2008 and, somewhat less dramatically, more recently. Because the risk of runs in wholesale funding manifests itself in different ways in different countries' financial systems, the appropriate response will likely be a mix of national and international actions, not an international agreement like Basel III. But for this very reason, it is important that there be ongoing attention to the issue, in order to share ideas for action and monitor the steps various jurisdictions are taking to mitigate the risks. For example, we in the United States need to move forward with changes to money market funds and triparty repo markets to ensure that they do not serve as a trigger for wholesale funding runs. We also need to address further the issues raised by the dependence of some foreign banking institutions on large amounts of wholesale dollar funding. The responses to these issues may themselves involve a mix of national and international measures. A third priority is the area of OTC derivatives, where strong capital standards alone are not enough to contain systemic risks. We know that OTC derivatives dealers, as a byproduct of that business model, become part of a global network of interconnected exposures. When one dealer in the network fails, as we saw in the case of Lehman Brothers, fear of losses at other dealers in the network can cause systemic stress. Capital, which covers only a fraction of exposure, cannot alone prevent this contagion. To reduce the systemic risk of OTC derivatives, the Group of Twenty (G-20) leaders have agreed to mandate that standardized OTC derivatives must be cleared through a central counterparty. Work in the United States is well under way to implement mandatory clearing. Other countries have begun this work as well, but progress abroad has been slow to date. To help ensure that a global move toward central clearing of derivatives actually reduces systemic risk, it is critical that central counterparties in the derivatives market be very sound and stable. Therefore, it is essential that the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) complete their important work on strengthening the oversight of central counterparties as soon as possible. To further build shock absorbers in the derivatives network, non-standardized derivatives that are not suitable for clearing should have margin requirements that are sufficient to prevent contagion when the next Lehman fails. An international working group has been formed for this purpose. We hope to see considerable progress on this element of OTC derivatives reform next year. Institutional ChangesAn audience of banking lawyers will appreciate the impact of the institutional features of international arrangements on the substantive output of those arrangements. In the time remaining this afternoon, I cannot do justice to this subject. But I do want to leave you with two observations about the international regulatory reform agenda of the last few years, along with some implications of those observations for desirable institutional changes. The first observation is that, although there are exceptions, the output of this agenda has largely consisted of what are essentially regulatory rules, intended to be applied to firms through national law. Second, most of these rules are being generated, or at least reviewed, within an overlapping set of organizations and arrangements--the Basel Committee, IOSCO, the FSB, the G-20, and a veritable potpourri of committees functioning under the umbrella of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). These rather mundane observations lead, I think, to some rather important institutional implications. It goes without saying that the benefits of international regulatory rules will be realized only if they are implemented rigorously and consistently across jurisdictions. Not only must they be incorporated into national legislation or regulations effectively, they must also be rigorously enforced by national supervisors. We do not need formal dispute mechanisms similar to those in the World Trade Organization, which could undermine supervisory cooperation, but we do need effective, collaborative monitoring mechanisms administered by the supervisors themselves and reported to the public. So, for example, the Federal Reserve has suggested that the Basel Committee go beyond the important function of reviewing legal implementation and also monitor how capital standards are applied within banks. While a variety of methods could be used, we are particularly interested in establishing international validation teams to verify methodologies used at individual banks on such matters as the risk-weighting of trading assets. Even as the Basel Committee should monitor compliance with the standards it establishes, it must not lose sight of the importance of supervisory cooperation in pursuit of the shared goal of a stable international financial system. The focus on rules and standards over the last few years has been both understandable and necessary, but the Basel Committee should not be purely a negotiating forum. The activities of the Basel Committee in the 1970s and early 1980s were largely informal, involving the sharing of supervisory perspectives and, perhaps more importantly, the establishment of relationships that could be drawn upon when cross-border supervisory problems arose. I regret that these functions have been substantially attenuated over the years. With the increased membership and expanded scope of activities, a return to early practice is not feasible. But other ways must be found to foster the common goals of committee members in promoting safe and sound financial systems. The overlapping, sometimes competing, activities of all the international committees and arrangements is, like the recent emphasis on rules, completely understandable in light of the number of new and urgent issues to be tackled. Similarly, the involvement of political officials through the G-20 was imperative to galvanize the legislative and regulatory processes of participating countries to undertake the breadth of needed reforms. But as we move toward administering these new standards and arrangements, we must rationalize the often confusing and duplicative process whereby the Basel Committee, the FSB, and some other BIS committees are all involved in the same subjects. Fortunately, the agenda breaks down rather naturally into the new substantive topics, such as resolution and OTC derivatives, and the further refinement and implementation of established regulatory areas such as capital standards. The new topics play to the coordinating and gap-filling strengths of the FSB, which includes both regulators and finance ministry representatives, and which can parcel out appropriate components of larger projects to standard-setting committees. Work in established regulatory areas obviously falls more appropriately within the province of the Basel Committee (or with respect to some securities regulatory issues, IOSCO), which consists of the regulators with responsibility for administering these standards domestically. In this regard, it is important that the independence of regulators established domestically also be respected internationally. ConclusionThe international dimension of financial regulation has grown even more important since the financial crisis. Yet there are, as I have suggested, more subjects to be tackled. At the same time, the pursuit of efficient and effective regulation requires priority-setting by, and rationalization of, the web of international arrangements dealing with these issues. 1.Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2011),Progress Report on Basel III Implementation(PDF)(Bank for International Settlements: Basel, Switzerland, October).Return to text 2.See Bank for International Settlements (2010), "Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision Announces Higher Global Minimum Capital Standards," press release, September 12.Return to text
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke At the Town Hall Meeting with Soldiers and and Their Families, Fort Bliss, Texas It is an honor and a privilege for me to join the men and women of Fort Bliss today. As someone who puts a high value on public service, I want to thank the soldiers here for their service to our country and for helping to make the world a safer place. I admire your professionalism and dedication. I want to thank your family members as well; servicemembers could not achieve what they do without the support and sacrifices of their families. You should all be proud of what you have accomplished and what you stand for. You may be wondering why the Chairman of the Federal Reserve would travel to Texas to speak at a military base. I meet with groups with a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives on our economy to listen and learn, as well as to explain what the Federal Reserve is doing to try to improve our economic situation. I'm here because the men and women in military service, like all Americans, are profoundly affected by the economic challenges our nation has faced these past several years. Your hometowns may be struggling with foreclosures. You may have had difficulty getting a loan to buy a car or a house. You may have family members who have had trouble finding employment in a tough job market. You may be worried about your own job prospects when the time comes for you to leave the military. So this morning I thought I'd first say a few words about what the Federal Reserve is doing to help strengthen our economy and increase economic opportunity. I also want to make sure you are aware of some of the special financial protections for people in the military. Just this Tuesday I met with Holly Petraeus, head of the Office of Servicemembers Affairs in the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Ms. Petraeus and I share a common commitment to ensuring that the men and women who protect the security of our country are themselves protected from predatory lending and other abusive financial practices. I will also share a few thoughts about what each of you can do to give yourself the best shot at a promising financial future. Federal Reserve Efforts to Improve the Economy's PerformanceAt the Federal Reserve, we are working hard--both as central bankers and as financial regulators--to help restore our nation's prosperity. In 2008 and early 2009, the world suffered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, a crisis which, had it been left unchecked, would have resulted in a global financial meltdown and an economic collapse. Working with policymakers around the world, the Federal Reserve acted creatively and forcefully to help stabilize the financial system and halt the economic slide. Our economy has been growing and adding jobs for more than two years now. But for a lot of people, I know, it doesn't feel like the recession ever ended. The unemployment rate remains painfully high, and more than two-fifths of the unemployed have been out of work for longer than six months, by far the highest ratio since World War II. These problems are very serious, and we at the Federal Reserve have been focusing intently on supporting job creation. Supporting job creation is half of our marching orders, so to speak; the other half is controlling inflation. Or, in the language of the law that sets the mandate for monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is required to seek both maximum employment and price stability. We pursue those two important goals by influencing the level of interest rates and other financial conditions. My colleagues and I on the Federal Reserve's monetary policymaking committee equate price stability with inflation being at 2 percent or a little less. That rate is low enough that people and businesses can make financial decisions without having to worry too much about rising costs, but high enough to keep the economy away from deflation--falling wages and prices--which is both a cause and a symptom of an extremely weak economy. Although spikes in oil and food prices, and other transitory factors, pushed inflation up earlier this year, inflation appears to be moderating, and we expect, based on the best information that we have today, that it will remain reasonably close to our objective of 2 percent or a bit less for the foreseeable future. In the longer term, monetary policy is the main determinant of inflation, and so Federal Reserve policymakers have considerable latitude to choose our longer-term inflation goal. In contrast, "maximum employment" depends on many factors outside of the Federal Reserve's control, such as the skills of the workforce and the pace of technological innovation. Right now, my colleagues on the Fed's policymaking committee estimate that the U.S. economy could sustain an unemployment rate of somewhere between 5 and 6 percent without generating a buildup of inflation pressures. But, regardless of whether the sustainable rate is 5 or 6 percent, with unemployment currently at 9 percent, our economy is certainly falling far short of maximum employment. That high unemployment rate is why the Federal Reserve is focusing its monetary policy at strengthening the recovery and job creation, including keeping short-term interest rates near zero and longer-term rates, such as mortgage rates, at the lowest levels in decades. Keeping borrowing costs very low supports consumer purchases of houses, cars, and other goods and services, as well as business investment in new equipment, software, and facilities. Over time, greater demand on the part of households and businesses leads to increased economic activity and employment. Like other central banks around the world, one way in which we have put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates is by purchasing high-quality, longer-term securities in the open market--specifically, in our case, U.S. government securities and federally backed mortgage securities. It is important to understand that this type of activity isn't the same as government spending. We will sell the securities back into the market or simply allow them to mature as part of the process of tightening monetary policy when the economy improves. In the meantime, we earn interest on the securities we hold. In fact, the Federal Reserve's securities purchases and other actions during and after the crisis have had the side effect of reducing the federal budget deficit. Last year and the year before, we returned a total of $125 billion of those earnings to the U.S. Treasury, and payments to the Treasury in the current year will be substantial as well. In addition to our monetary policy role, the Federal Reserve shares responsibility with other government agencies for regulating and supervising banks, protecting consumers in their financial dealings, and fostering financial stability. We're working with the other agencies to significantly increase the financial reserves that banks--especially the largest banks that can put the financial system at risk--must hold against possible losses. The Fed and the other agencies also are toughening the restrictions on the kinds of financial transactions that banks can undertake and working to ensure that bankers' compensation packages do not give them incentives to take excessive risks. We are requiring banks to compensate and assist foreclosed-upon homeowners who were unfairly treated. And, importantly, we are working to increase the resilience of the financial system as a whole against financial and economic shocks that may occur in the future. We are also collaborating with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to implement new rules that will make it easier for the government to unwind big financial firms if they get into trouble, rather than being faced with the terrible choice of either bailing them out or risking the collapse of the financial system if they fail. Of course, the Federal Reserve was never intended to shoulder the entire burden of promoting economic prosperity. Fostering healthy growth and job creation is a shared responsibility of all economic policymakers, in close cooperation with the private sector. Spending and tax policy is of critical importance, but a wide range of other policies--pertaining to labor markets, housing, trade, taxation, and regulation, for example--also have important roles to play. Financial Protections for ServicemembersThe Federal Reserve, along with the other agencies, is working hard to enforce an array of strengthened regulations that protect mortgage borrowers, credit card holders, and other consumers of financial services. The people in this room should be aware, in particular, of the special rights and protections provided to military personnel by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The law's purpose is to allow servicemembers to perform their duties without worry of foreclosure, eviction, and civil prosecution--under most circumstances. It caps interest rates for debts incurred before a servicemember begins active duty, it prevents creditors from foreclosing on a home or repossessing a car without a court order, it gives servicemembers the option to terminate residential property and motor vehicle leases, it stays civil proceedings while servicemembers are on active duty, and it entitles servicemembers to reinstatement of health insurance that was in effect before their military service began. Additionally, Department of Defense rules regulate the terms of certain kinds of high-cost loans to servicemembers and their families, such as payday loans, tax refund anticipation loans, and motor vehicle title loans. Advice on Securing and Promising Financial FutureIt takes more than rules, however sound, and enforcement, however diligent, to provide you and your families with a promising financial future. While I have the pulpit, so to speak, permit me to offer three pieces of advice. First, while you are in the military, take advantage of training opportunities. Many specific skills learned in the military--nursing and healthcare, mechanics, computer programming, police and security work--transfer to civilian jobs. The military also offers training in various life skills. For instance, this morning I visited the Fort Bliss Army Community Service training center, which offers classes on such financial topics as budgeting, debt management, understanding credit, car buying, and protecting against identity theft. More broadly, according to a recent study, 80 percent of veterans said their military experience helped them get ahead in life.1They said the experience helped them mature, taught them to work with others, and built their self-confidence. The value of military experience is reflected in the fact that the unemployment rate for veterans tends to be lower than the rate for non-veterans.2 Second, when you leave the military, take advantage of education benefits for veterans. The Post-9/11 GI Bill pays for tuition and fees, a monthly housing allowance, and books and supplies. Keep in mind that, on average, compared with high school graduates, people with college degrees earn about twice as much and suffer about half the rate of unemployment.3 Finally, educate yourself about your own personal finances. Research by the Federal Reserve right here at Fort Bliss shows that financial education can pay off.4Beginning in 2003, the Federal Reserve collaborated with Army Emergency Relief, the U.S. Army's own financial assistance organization, to provide a two-day financial education course, taught by the staff of San Diego City College, to younger enlisted soldiers--mostly men in their early 20s. We surveyed them about their financial history and activities at the time of the course, and we did follow-up surveys in 2008 and 2009 of both servicemembers who had participated in the course and soldiers who had not. We found that soldiers who had taken the course were more likely to make smart financial choices, such as comparison shopping for major purchases, saving for retirement, and educating themselves about money management. They were less likely to make questionable financial decisions, like paying overdraft fees, taking out car title loans, and continually running credit card balances. Making good, well-thought-out financial decisions can make all the difference to your financial future. ConclusionI began my remarks by describing some of our country's near-term economic challenges. I want to end by sounding a note of optimism. The U.S. economy remains the largest in the world, with a highly diverse mix of industries and a degree of international competitiveness that, if anything, has improved in recent years. The United States continues to be a great place to do business, with a strong system of laws, an entrepreneurial tradition, and flexible capital and labor markets. And our country remains a technological leader, with many of the world's leading research universities and the highest spending on research and development of any nation. Ultimately, these strengths will reassert themselves if our country takes the steps that are necessary to prepare for the future--for example, by putting the federal budget on a sustainable path and improving our primary and secondary education system. The Federal Reserve will certainly do its part to help restore high rates of growth and employment in a context of price stability. Let me end by again expressing my deep gratitude to all of you here for your service to our country. I am happy to respond to your questions. 1.See Pew Research Center (2011),"War and Sacrifice in the Post-9/11 Era: The Military-Civilian Gap"(Washington: PRC, October 5).Return to text 2.In October 2011, the unemployment rate was 7.7 percent for veterans and 8.8 percent for non-veterans (not seasonally adjusted, age 18 and older).Return to text 3.In October 2011, the unemployment rate for college graduates was 4.4 percent compared with 9.6 percent for those with only a high school education.Return to text 4.See Catherine Bell, Daniel Gorin, and Jeanne M.

Good morning. Welcome to the Federal Reserve Board and today's conference, "Small Business and Entrepreneurship during an Economic Recovery." Let me begin by thanking the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, both of which have cooperated closely with the Board of Governors in organizing this event. This meeting is indeed an eclectic one, bringing together small business owners, lenders, technical assistance providers, government officials, and members of the academic community to explore the challenges faced by today's entrepreneurs and to identify promising approaches to addressing their needs. Events such as this one are particularly valuable because they allow us to draw on a broad range of experiences and evidence. We are keenly interested in hearing your insights and look forward to sharing results from the Federal Reserve's continued small business outreach and research efforts. Some of you may have attended a forum here last year that focused on credit access for small businesses.1We hope to advance that discussion today by exploring not only the financing needs of creditworthy small businesses, but also the role these firms could play in creating jobs during these difficult economic times. We will also discuss the unique challenges faced by women- and minority-owned firms. We hope to be as concrete and practical as possible; for example, several conference papers assess the extent to which training, technical assistance, and other resources are available to support these and other small firms. The ultimate goal of this meeting is to learn more about how best to support both small businesses and their communities--to understand what works and what doesn't. Importance of Small Businesses to the EconomyIt's no secret that the past few years have been very difficult for many small firms. They have faced weak sales, diminished asset values, elevated uncertainty, and tight credit market conditions. Many small business owners have had to lay off employees or defer hiring. And many potential entrepreneurs with plans to start new businesses have put those plans on hold. The role of small businesses and entrepreneurship in job creation will be discussed in our first panel today. As many of you are aware, small businesses have played an important role in fueling past economic recoveries. We need to think carefully about how, in the current economic environment, our nation can best provide small businesses and entrepreneurs with the support they need to expand job opportunities. Small businesses also help our country compete globally; they often offer a level of agility in bringing innovative products to the global marketplace that larger firms cannot match. At home, many entrepreneurs do more than provide important goods and services--they and their businesses help sustain the vitality of the neighborhoods in which they live and work. Frequently, small business owners demonstrate their commitment to their communities by serving in leadership positions in local schools, volunteering for local nonprofit organizations, and engaging in civic affairs. For many people, starting a small business is an opportunity to follow one's particular dream. We should recognize that it can also be an important option for people confronting economic challenges in their lives, such as insufficient retirement savings. A study conducted by the Kauffman Foundation suggests that both baby boomers and older generations are increasingly turning to entrepreneurial activities.2Tomorrow's discussion will pay special attention to how these and other new entrepreneurs are adjusting to the changing landscape of financial services. Federal Reserve Efforts to Support Small BusinessesThe Federal Reserve System is committed to supporting small business and entrepreneurship. We do that, for example, through research that adds to our stock of knowledge about the catalysts for and barriers to entrepreneurship, and through outreach programs to help small business owners and other community stakeholders gain access to a range of financing and technical assistance. For instance, in a recent forum sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and held in Jacksonville, Florida, both small business owners and their lenders stressed that it takes more than an enterprising spirit to succeed; entrepreneurs also must seek appropriate training and resources. Forum participants emphasized the need to support organizations that offer valuable technical assistance and training programs, including state and regional economic development offices, small business development centers, community colleges, technical schools, and rural cooperative extension offices. Similar forums in Chicago, Atlanta, and Denver--conducted by the Federal Reserve in cooperation with the Opportunity Finance Network, a national trade association for community development financial institutions (CDFIs)--highlighted examples of banks working closely with community development loan funds and other CDFIs to streamline client referral processes to match small businesses with appropriate lenders. Our regional meetings also focused on providing capital and support services to minority-owned small businesses. Through research and analytical efforts, we are working to deepen our understanding of credit market conditions facing small and new businesses, particularly the frictions that impede the flow of credit to creditworthy borrowers. In addition, some of our community development offices conduct regional surveys to obtain a better understanding of the characteristics and financing needs of small business owners in their areas. You will hear more about their findings during the second panel today. The Federal Reserve also continues to encourage bank examiners to adopt a balanced approach to reviewing banks' lending to small businesses. We hold training sessions for examiners and extend outreach to lenders to promote awareness about both the credit environment and available lending guidance and resources. We would like to foster an environment in which lenders do all they can to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers while maintaining appropriately prudent underwriting standards. Closing ObservationsThe issues you will be discussing today and tomorrow are critical to everyone with an interest in the success of our nation's small firms and entrepreneurs, and, by extension, of our economy as a whole. Based on the wide variety of perspectives represented at today's conference, I feel sure you won't agree on the answers to all the many questions that will be raised. But the dialogue itself is of great value. We at the Federal Reserve have found that conferences such as this one help us to more effectively conduct our outreach and analytical work. We hope that each of you will find this experience worthwhile as well. Thank you in advance for sharing your insights about the challenges for small businesses, and I look forward to seeing the results of your work. 1.More information on "Addressing the Needs of Small Businesses," held July 12, 2010, is available on the Board's website atwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/conferences/asfbconf.htm.Return to text 2.See Dane Stangler (2009),The Coming Entrepreneurship Boom(Kansas City, Mo.: Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation).Return to text
