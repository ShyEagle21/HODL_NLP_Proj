Governor Lisa D. Cook At the Seventh Conference on Law and Macroeconomics, University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Thank you, Dean Logue. It is wonderful to be back in my adopted home state of Michigan and on the University of Michigan's beautiful campus. The fact that you got this Georgia native to visit in the first week of January shows you just how much I love it here. But, seriously, the program committee for the University of Michigan Law School's Seventh Conference on Law and Macroeconomics has put together an impressive program. I am grateful for the opportunity to present my views and to learn from all of you.1 Today, I would like to speak about the Federal Reserve Board's work on financial stability. It is a topic that holds special importance to me, because I am the chair of the Board of Governors' Committee on Financial Stability. But before speaking on financial stability, given that it is the beginning of a new year, I thought it would be helpful to share my economic outlook and my views on appropriate monetary policy. Overall, the U.S. economy starts the year in good shape. Economic growth was quite strong in 2024. Inflation has fallen considerably from its peak two and a half years ago, though it remains somewhat above the Fed's 2 percent objective. The labor market is solid, with the unemployment rate still relatively low and Americans, on average, bringing home paychecks that are growing faster than inflation. My focus, and that of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is on our dual-mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. This year, I will continue to work on calibrating monetary policy to ensure inflation returns sustainably to our 2 percent target while maintaining a solid labor market. I will also carefully monitor financial stability risks and vulnerabilities and work with my colleagues at the Fed and other agencies to reduce the likelihood that financial stability problems will disrupt the economy. Economic ActivityAs I stated, the economy grew at a strong pace recently. Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter of last year, and many forecasters estimate growth of about 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter. Those readings indicate that 2024 growth was just below the pace in 2023. That is notable, because many forecasters were anticipating a much more significant slowdown at this time last year. That raises an important question: How has the economy maintained this pace of growth in recent years? For that, I look mainly to the supply side of the economy. Labor supply has been boosted by a rebound in labor force participation, especially for workers aged 25 to 54. Since February 2023, labor force participation for these workers equaled or exceeded its peak just before the pandemic of 83.1 percent and was 83.5 percent in November. Another contribution to labor supply came from the post-pandemic increase in immigration. Faster productivity growth also has supported economic growth. Labor productivity rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent since the end of 2019, higher than the average 1.5 percent growth over the previous 12 years. Although the rapid growth in labor supply is unlikely to persist in coming years, I see several reasons to expect that productivity growth will remain strong.2The U.S. experienced a surge in new business formation since the start of the pandemic. These newer firms are more likely to innovate and adopt new technologies and business processes, thus boosting productivity. Another factor likely to boost productivity growth is the high rate of investment among U.S. firms in artificial intelligence and other new technologies. Generative AI, in particular, may significantly increase the arrival rate of ideas, which should support productivity and growth. On the demand side, American households' robust spending has driven the economy, and that has continued in recent months. Retail sales outside of gasoline stations rose 4.4 percent in November from a year earlier, an acceleration from the previous month's reading. While the unusually large savings balances built up during the pandemic have shrunk for many households, strong labor income growth continues to underpin consumer spending. That income growth is due both to solid job growth and to rising inflation-adjusted wages. InflationPrice increases have cooled notably over the past two and a half years, but, despite this significant progress on disinflation, there is still further to go before reaching our inflation target of 2 percent. Annual inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has eased to 2.4 percent in November 2024, the latest available reading, from a peak of 7.2 percent in June 2022. When excluding often volatile food and energy costs, core PCE was down to 2.8 percent in November from 5.6 percent in September 2022.Inflation readings can be volatile month to month, and the path of disinflation has been bumpy and may continue to be. Monthly readings earlier in the fall were slightly stronger than expected. However, November's monthly change was lower than expected and consistent with a 2 percent inflation trend. Over the past year, core goods prices decelerated, reflecting that supply and demand have come into better alignment. Meanwhile, the more modest wage growth I mentioned has contributed to downward pressure on services inflation, outside of housing. Rent growth and other measures of housing inflation remain elevated but stepped down in the November report. I expect more progress in reducing housing services inflation this year as the earlier slowing in growth of rents charged to new tenants feeds through into the growth of average rents. I continue to see inflation as gradually—if unevenly—returning over time to our goal of 2 percent in a sustainable manner. Labor MarketTurning to the labor market, I see it as solid, though as having cooled over the past year. The U.S. labor market has come into better balance after a period of being very tight, with high turnover, during the initial recovery from the pandemic. The unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in November. While the latest reading is still below historical averages, it has risen from the multidecade low of 3.4 percent in April 2023.New applications for unemployment benefits and other measures of layoffs also remain low, but the rate of hiring has slowed to below the pace recorded in the years before the pandemic. The number of open jobs has essentially come back in line with the number of unemployed Americans seeking work. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has fallen to 1.1 from a peak of 2.0 in 2022. I will continue to monitor developments in the labor market closely, including continuing claims, which have risen in recent months. After a period of elevated job-switching early in the recovery, workers are voluntarily leaving their jobs at lower rates. And the gap between wage growth for job switchers and job stayers has largely gone away. Thus, I do not see the labor market as a source of significant inflationary pressure. Monetary PolicyThinking of how the economy has evolved over the past year, at the start of 2024 the federal funds rate was at its highest level in more than two decades, providing notable restraint. Over the course of last year, inflation made gradual progress toward our objective, while the labor market gradually cooled. Thus, in September, I voted along with my FOMC colleagues to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate half a point after maintaining it at a peak of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for more than a year, and we subsequently approved two more quarter-point cuts in November and December. I continue to view the risks to achieving the two sides of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment as being roughly in balance. Over time, I still think it will likely be appropriate to move the policy rate toward a more neutral stance. However, the 100 basis points of rate cuts since September have notably reduced the restrictiveness of monetary policy. All along, I envisioned moving more quickly in the early stages of our easing campaign and then easing more gradually as the policy rate came closer to neutral. In addition, since September, the labor market has been somewhat more resilient, while inflation has been stickier than I assumed at that time. Thus, I think we can afford to proceed more cautiously with further cuts. Policy is not on a preset course. The magnitude and timing of future changes to policy rates will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. My policy decisions will be guided by our dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment, and I know delivering on those goals will produce the best economic outcomes for all Americans. Overview of Financial StabilityNow, I would like to move from a discussion of monetary policy to a description of the Board's work on financial stability. It is a core part of the Fed's mission, because a stable financial system provides financing and services to allow households, communities, and businesses to invest, grow, and participate in a well-functioning economy. To begin that discussion, I will start by saying that I assess the financial system as being sound and resilient. I will share the evidence I believe supports this view and raise a few potential vulnerabilities that will require close monitoring. Since November 2018, the Fed has published the semiannualFinancial Stability Report,which provides assessments of key vulnerabilities, with an emphasis on four broad categories: household and business borrowing, financial-sector leverage, funding risks, and asset valuations.3It also looks at some potential shocks. An important distinction exists between shocks and vulnerabilities. Shocks are adverse events, such as the pandemic, that by their nature are difficult to predict. Vulnerabilities—aspects of the financial system that would exacerbate stress—tend to build up over time and can be identified, assessed, and monitored. Policies to build resilience in the financial system are appropriately targeted at reducing vulnerabilities. I am sure many in the room have reviewed the most recent report released in November, but I will briefly summarize some key findings. Households and businesses appear to be in good shape and can service their debt, which is at manageable levels overall. In terms of financial-sector leverage, high levels of capital and liquidity in the banking system are a key source of resilience. Funding risks in the banking system have declined somewhat: Smaller banks have replaced some of their uninsured deposit funding with brokered and reciprocal deposits, which are less prone to runs but are still less stable than core bank deposits. Some nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs), including some large hedge funds, do have high leverage. NBFIs may also be exposed to liquidity stress that could be brought on by, among other things, bouts of market volatility. Valuations are elevated in a number of asset classes, including equity and corporate debt markets, where estimated risk premia are near the bottom of their historical distributions, suggesting that markets may be priced to perfection and, therefore, susceptible to large declines, which could result from bad economic news or a change in investor sentiment. Prices of some commercial properties have fallen substantially since 2022, particularly office buildings. I continue to be attentive to developments here. Identifying Areas to MonitorI would like to use the remainder of my time today to talk about a few areas that I am paying close attention to, specifically private credit, stablecoins, cyber events, and AI. The rapid growth of novel products, business models, or technologies can lead to a buildup of familiar vulnerabilities by, for example, promoting excessive leverage or increasing interconnectedness. They can also bring novel shocks. But I want to stress that experience has also taught us that financial and technological innovations are hallmarks of a healthy financial system, and my remarks today should be viewed in that context. Let me start with private credit, which generally refers to direct loans made to businesses, mostly middle-market firms, by nonbank entities such as private debt funds and business development companies. Private credit has grown quite rapidly in the U.S., from around $500 billion in 2016 to more than $1.5 trillion at the end of 2023, making it comparable in size to both the high-yield bond and leveraged loan markets.4Private credit funds appear well positioned to hold the riskiest parts of corporate lending. These intermediaries generally use little leverage and are organized as closed-end funds, which means that investors—including pension funds, insurers, sovereign wealth funds, and certain retail investors—cannot redeem their fund shares, which limits the potential for runs. At the same time, it is important to monitor and emphasize proper risk management of rapidly growing products or business models, especially those that have not been tested through a full credit cycle.For instance, because of its role in credit creation, private credit has become a more macro-relevant sector that can transmit shocks through the real economy in the same way as shocks to other material sources of nonfinancial credit. We also need to look at private credit in the context of the overall private finance ecosystem. Opacity and complexity can obscure buildups of operating leverage when borrowing by multiple entities in an intermediation chain is not apparent. Vulnerabilities due to this stacking of leverage may be exacerbated by interconnections within intermediation chains. Those could include overlapping management of private credit and private equity, private credit being provided to businesses sponsored by private equity, and unobserved provision of leverage to private credit funds by other financial intermediaries. Moreover, few private credit providers have experienced a complete credit cycle, which makes it difficult to predict how the industry might respond to a negative shock. I will now move to a discussion of stablecoins, which are digital assets that seek to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset such as a national currency. They may also be accepted in different parts of the payment system. With assets under management of around $170 billion, stablecoins have a relatively small footprint in the U.S.5They are not widely used as a cash-management vehicle or for transactions for real economic activity but are generally used for digital asset investments. Stablecoins lack a comprehensive federal regulatory framework, and many U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins operate abroad. Stablecoins could scale quickly, particularly if the stablecoin is supported by access to an existing customer base. The fact that stablecoins are pegged to a reference asset makes them structurally vulnerable to runs. If a run on a large stablecoin were to occur, liquidation of the assets backing the stablecoin could be disruptive, especially if those assets were linked to other funding markets, like commercial paper or certificates of deposit. Some stablecoins have restrictions on redemptions, which can help reduce vulnerabilities, assuming that investors alter their expectations to reflect such restrictions. Questions have emerged about the role of stablecoins in intermediation chains, including the use of leverage by stablecoin investors and the use of stablecoins to obtain leverage—for example, by serving as loan collateral. I will continue to monitor developments in these areas. Now, I would like to move to cyberattacks and similar events—such as hardware or software failures—which are becoming more common. The number of cyberattacks on financial institutions and insurers more than doubled from 2014 and 2015 to 2020, and more than doubled again from 2020 to 2022 and 2023.6To be affected by a cyberattack, a financial institution need not be the direct target of a cyber event. In fact, the target of the cyberattack does not itself need to be a financial institution to have the potential to impose business disruptions and losses on the financial system. As an example, a recent study analyzed a cyber event at a technology service provider that ended up preventing its bank customers from sending payments to other banks.7The inability to make payments caused reserves at the technology provider's bank clients to increase, but reserves declined at the banks not receiving the payments they were owed. Many of these banks managed their reserves by borrowing in the fed funds market or requesting discount window loans that were granted by the Federal Reserve Banks. This incident did not become systemic for a few reasons. First, the technology service provider was not a dominant player in the market. Second, the Federal Reserve extended hours for banks to send payments to each other. And, third, liquidity buffers and reliable external liquidity sources were available for banks that experienced material declines in reserves. Nonetheless, the incident underscores how operational dependencies with nonfinancial service providers or between financial institutions can be a source of stress to the broader financial system. Two other recent cyberattacks against private entities bring home this point. A 2022 ransomware attack on a third-party service provider in derivatives markets caused material business disruptions at their clients, which included more than one-fourth of the registered futures commission merchants in the U.S. These clients had to manually perform trade execution and matching, settlement and clearing, margin calculations, and reporting functions. The delays disrupted the business operations of their clients and spilled over to operations at some derivatives exchanges. A 2023 event at an institution involved in clearing in the U.S. Treasury and Treasury repo markets delayed payments to its customers and counterparties, disrupted clearing, and caused a significant jump in failed trades. The fact that these events did not do more damage to the system does not reduce our efforts to make sure we have a fuller understanding of how attacks can affect the financial system, and we will continue to invest in data and expand our expertise. The Fed's role in promoting resilience to cyber vulnerabilities is focused primarily on ensuring the institutions we supervise effectively manage the cyber risks they face. We also work with our partners across the government, including the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and with the private sector to understand and address cyber risks. The final area I will discuss is AI, specifically generative artificial intelligence, or GenAI. In previous speeches, I have discussed the potential benefits of GenAI for economic outcomes at both the individual and macroeconomic levels, and I have also enumerated some risks that will need to be managed.8AI use cases and its adoption in finance have jumped with advances in data management, deep learning, computing power, and experience with previous generations of AI models. As I mentioned earlier, the use of technological innovation in finance is nothing new. As an example, I think about the progression of transitions at banks, going from physically processing checks to electronic payments processing and direct deposit, to online banking, to mobile banking and mobile check clearing, and now to digital wallets. Similar examples exist in finance. So when we think about GenAI, it is important to orient ourselves in a way that is both curious and open to the significant benefits it can bring to the financial system while staying cognizant of the need to identify and manage various risks. The risks I will mention today are grounded in the same vulnerabilities I have been discussing from the outset. While GenAI may trigger vulnerabilities in novel ways, the vulnerabilities themselves are not new. As I mentioned earlier, dependencies and interconnections within and outside of the financial system are a prime factor that can transmit and amplify shocks, including through the use of AI in decision making. At a high level, concentrations relating to the use of specific pre-trained models and accompanying data, third-party service providers, and business strategies can push AIs toward the same outcome, and that can be a source of systemic risk as AIs become more widely used. For example, GenAI can be a powerful tool for executing different trading strategies, including momentum trading, and could generate or exacerbate the same dynamics seen during the flash crash of 2010 and similar crashes that occurred before recent advances in GenAI. Errors or biases in AI models or unrepresentative data sets can also induce correlated behaviors that push financial markets into unstable territory. To put it another way, what happens when one or more of the models gets it wrong if everyone relies on just a couple of models? And "getting it wrong" might simply mean relying on historical data to analyze a situation where there are no analogues in the historical record, such as during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Relatedly, one might question if historical evidence is valid, because the data used by AIs to analyze various market strategies, for example, were not generated by the current version of the AIs.9 ConclusionLet me conclude by reiterating that technological innovation and resilience are both attributes of a healthy financial system. I will, of course, remain vigilant with respect to vulnerabilities that appear to be evolving as well as emerging risks, but I see a system that is sound, resilient, and able to support the needs of households, communities, and businesses. The good position of the financial system is consistent with a broader economy that is strong, with a solid labor market and moderating inflation. Thank you for your indulgence and thanks, again, to Dean Logue and the University of Michigan Law School for hosting this conference. I look forward to our discussion. 1.

Governor Michelle W. Bowman At The New England CEO Summit, Portsmouth, New Hampshire Let me begin by saying my thoughts and prayers are with the families of the passengers and crew who perished in the tragic flight accident in Washington, D.C. Wednesday evening. Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today.1It is a pleasure to be with you virtually for your CEO Summit. I always enjoy the opportunity to meet bankers from across the country, especially New England, to learn about the issues that are important to you. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its January meeting earlier this week, so I will begin by offering some brief remarks on the economy, and then share my views on a number of mutual and community bank issues, before addressing some questions that were submitted by your members in advance of today's meeting. Update on the Most Recent FOMC MeetingAt our FOMC meeting this week, my colleagues and I voted to hold the federal funds rate target range at 4-1/4 to 4‑1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. I supported this action because, after recalibrating the level of the policy rate towards the end of last year to reflect the progress made since 2023 on lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, I think that policy is now in a good place to position the Committee to pay closer attention to the inflation data as it evolves. Looking ahead to 2025, in my view, the current policy stance also provides the opportunity to review further indicators of economic activity and get clarity on the administration's policies and their effects on the economy. It will be very important to have a better sense of the actual policies and how they will be implemented, in addition to greater confidence about how the economy will respond. Brief Remarks on the EconomyThe U.S. economy remained strong through the end of last year, with solid growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment. Core inflation remains elevated, but my expectation is that it will moderate further this year. Even with this outlook, I continue to see upside risks to inflation. The rate of inflation declined significantly in 2023, but it slowed by noticeably less last year. Without having seen the December data released this morning, I estimate that the 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation—which excludes food and energy prices—likely remained unchanged at 2.8 percent in December, only slightly below its 3.0 percent reading at the end of 2023. Progress has been slow and uneven since the spring of last year mostly due to a slowing in core goods price declines. After increasing at a solid pace, on average, over the initial three quarters of last year, gross domestic product appears to have risen a bit more slowly in the fourth quarter, reflecting a large drop in inventory investment, which is a volatile category. In contrast, private domestic final purchases, which provide a better signal about underlying growth in economic activity, maintained its strong momentum from earlier in the year, as personal consumption rose robustly again in the fourth quarter. Some measures of consumer sentiment appear to have improved recently but are still well below pre-pandemic levels, likely because of higher prices. And since housing, food, and energy price increases have far outpaced overall inflation since the pandemic, lower-income households have experienced the negative impacts of inflation hardest, especially as these households have limited options to trade down for lower-cost goods and services. Payroll employment gains rebounded strongly in December and averaged about 170,000 per month in the fourth quarter, a pace that is somewhat above average gains in the prior two quarters. The unemployment rate edged back down to 4.1 percent in December and has moved sideways since last June, remaining slightly below my estimate of full employment. The labor market appears to have stabilized in the second half of last year, after having loosened from extremely tight conditions. The rise in the unemployment rate since mid-2023 largely reflected weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs have remained low. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has remained close to the pre-pandemic level in recent months, and there are still more available jobs than available workers. The labor market no longer appears to be especially tight, but wage growth remains somewhat above the pace consistent with our inflation goal. I hope the revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor data, which will be released next week, will more accurately capture the changing dynamics of immigration and net business creation and bring more clarity on the underlying pace of job growth. It is crucial that U.S. official data accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real time, such as those in recent years, so we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. In the meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases. Assuming the economy evolves as I expect, I think that inflation will slow further this year. Its progress may be bumpy and uneven, and the upcoming inflation data for the first quarter will be an important indication of how quickly this will happen. That said, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains near full employment. Despite the prospect for some reduction in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia, global supply chains continue to be susceptible to disruptions, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. In addition, the release of pent-up demand following the election, especially with improving consumer and business sentiment, could lead to stronger economic activity, which could increase inflationary pressures. The Path ForwardAs we enter a new phase in the process of moving the federal funds rate toward a more neutral policy stance, I would prefer that future adjustments to the policy rate be gradual. We should take time to carefully assess the progress in achieving our inflation and employment goals and consider changes to the policy rate based on how the data evolves. Given the current stance of policy, I continue to be concerned that easier financial conditions over the past year may have contributed to the lack of further progress on slowing inflation. In light of the ongoing strength in the economy and with equity prices substantially higher than a year ago, it seems unlikely that the overall level of interest rates and borrowing costs are exerting meaningful restraint. I am also closely watching the increase in longer-term Treasury yields since we started the recalibration of our policy stance at the September meeting. Some have interpreted it as a reflection of investors' concerns about the possibility of tighter-than-expected policy that may be required to address inflationary pressures. In light of these considerations, I continue to prefer a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy. There is still more work to be done to bring inflation closer to our 2 percent goal. I would like to see progress in lowering inflation resume before we make further adjustments to the target range. We need to keep inflation in focus while the labor market appears to be in balance and the unemployment rate continues to be at historically low levels. By the time of our March meeting, we will have received two inflation and two employment reports. I look forward to reviewing the first quarter inflation data, which, as I noted earlier, will be key to understanding the path of inflation going forward. I do expect that inflation will begin to decline again and that by year-end it will be lower than where it now stands. Looking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. Bringing inflation in line with our price stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy labor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run. Perspective on Mutual and Community BanksTurning to banking, I will start with a brief discussion of the important role of mutual banks in the banking system before addressing other bank regulatory issues. One of the unique characteristics of the U.S. banking system is the broad scope of institutions it includes and the wide range of customers and communities it serves. Given this institutional diversity, regulators must strive to foster a financial system that enables each and every bank, no matter its size, to thrive, supporting a vibrant economy and financial system. Mutual Bank IssuesIn the Northeast, everyone is familiar with mutual banks given their significant presence in this region. Since the early 1800s, these banks have been dedicated to serving their local communities.2Their ownership structure differs from traditional banks in that mutuals are owned by their depositors, rather than by shareholders. Like other community banks, they focus on local issues that are important to their communities and to their depositors. Many of the challenges mutual banks face are similar to those faced by other financial institutions, including competition from other banks, credit unions, and non-banks. But mutual banks also face unique issues that can add cost and expense to their operations. Two issues I would like to discuss are the challenges mutual institutions face raising capital, and unique procedural hurdles mutuals face in managing the dividend process. While these issues are unique to mutuals, both highlight the challenges of a lack of transparency, and insufficient focus on efficiency.3 Just as with other community banks, a challenge for many mutuals is the difficulty of raising additional capital. This difficulty is exacerbated by their ownership structure, which typically requires mutuals to rely heavily on retained earnings. Although mutual institutions have historically been more highly capitalized relative to their stock-owned peers, if a mutual capital raise is needed, it would be helpful to provide some regulatory flexibility in the process. Recently, some mutuals have issued subordinated debt as a form of capital, but another form of regulatory capital may be preferable: mutual capital certificates. To date, it has been unclear whether mutual capital certificates qualify as regulatory capital. These instruments could provide mutual banks an additional way to raise capital without disrupting their mutual structure. In my view, the banking agencies should be receptive to these kinds of instruments to ensure that mutual banks can both raise capital and maintain their depositor-owned structure. Mutuals need clarity and transparency about the regulatory treatment of these instruments and whether they qualify as regulatory capital. Another concern for mutuals is the annual requirement to receive regulatory approval for a mutual holding company's waiver of a dividend issued by its subsidiary bank.4The Board practice is to require a mutual holding company to submit an application each year to implement a waiver. This prior approval requirement is complex and imposes significant costs on these small institutions, reducing the investment they can make in their communities. Because of the time and expense of these waiver requirements, it is possible that the inefficiencies of the required application process erode the value of a mutual holding company structure, which would further constrain a mutual bank's ability to raise capital. Since the Board has nearly 20 years of experience considering these waiver requests, it seems appropriate to consider whether the applications process for these waivers is efficient. What lessons have we learned? Is the prior approval requirement effective in its review of holding companies waiving receipt of their dividends, or can this be resolved in a more efficient and cost effective manner? In my view, the Board should consider whether this process is effective and efficient in addressing concerns related to dividend waivers. Mutual banks, like all community banks, are vital to the economic success of their communities. It is critical that our applications process not act as a limit on a particular type of institution simply due to regulatory inaction or lack of clarity and transparency. Regulators must find efficient and effective ways to support a vibrant and diverse banking system that enables these and other small institutions to thrive while supporting and investing in their local economy. TailoringTransparency and efficiency are just two of the necessary components of a regulatory approach that promotes a healthy and vibrant banking system. Another component that I speak about frequently is the use of "tailoring" in the regulatory framework. For those familiar with my philosophy on bank regulation and supervision, my interest and focus on tailoring will come as no surprise.5In its most basic form, it is difficult to disagree with the virtue of regulatory and supervisory tailoring—calibrating the requirements and expectations imposed on a firm based on its size, business model, risk profile, and complexity—as a reasonable, appropriate and responsible approach for bank regulation and supervision. In fact, tailoring is embedded in the statutory fabric of the Federal Reserve's bank regulatory responsibilities.6 The bank regulatory framework inherently includes significant costs—both the cost of operating the banking agencies, and the cost to the banking industry of complying with regulations, the examination process, and supplying information to regulators both through formal information collections and through one-off requests. In the aggregate, these costs can ultimately affect the price and availability of credit, geographic access to banking services, and the broader economy. The cost of this framework—both to regulators and to the industry—reflects layers of policy decisions over many years. But this framework could be more effective in balancing the mandate to promote safety and soundness with the need to have a banking system that promotes economic growth. For example, let's consider costs. As regulatory and supervisory demands grow, there is often parallel growth in the staff and budgets of the banking agencies. We should not only be cognizant of these costs, but we should act in a way that requires efficiency while ensuring safety and soundness. Some degree of elasticity in regulator capacity is necessary to respond to evolving economic and banking conditions, as well as emerging risks, but there must be reasonable constraints on growth. Expansion of the regulatory framework is not a cost-free endeavor, and the costs are shouldered by taxpayers, banks, and, ultimately, bank customers. The bank regulatory framework has great potential to provide significant benefits, including supporting an innovative banking system that enhances trust and confidence in our institutions, and promotes safety and soundness. When we consider the benefits and the costs, we can institute greater efficiencies in both banking regulation and in the banking industry itself. The bank regulatory framework is complex, and the various elements of this framework are intended to work in a complementary way. As banks evolve—by growing larger, or by engaging in new activities—tailoring can help us to quickly recalibrate requirements in light of the new risks posed by the firm. But the regulatory framework, especially how supervisors prioritize its application to the banking industry, can pose a serious threat to a bank's viability. For example, imposing the same regulatory requirements on banks with assets of $2 billion to $2 trillion under the new rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act demonstrated a missed opportunity to promote greater effectiveness and efficiency.7I question the wisdom of applying the same evaluation standards to banks within such a broad range. Likewise, supervisory guidance can provide fertile ground to differentiate supervisory expectations under a more tailored approach. While supervisory guidance is not binding on banks as a legal matter, it can signal how regulators think about particular risks and activities, and often drives community banks to reallocate resources in a way that may not be necessary or appropriate. The Fed's guidance on third-party risk management is an example of this. Originally, this guidance was published in a way that applied to all banks, including community banks. Yet, it was acknowledged even at the time of publication that it had known shortcomings, particularly in terms of its administration and lack of clarity for community banks.8 Tailoring is important for all banks, but it is particularly important for community banks. There are real costs not only to banks, but to communities, when the framework is insufficiently tailored, as community banks faced with excessive regulatory burdens may be forced to raise prices or shut their doors completely. These banks often reach unbanked or underbanked corners of the U.S. economy, not only in terms of the customers they serve but also in terms of their geographic footprint. We are all familiar with banking deserts and the challenges many legitimate and law-abiding businesses and consumers have in accessing basic banking services and credit. It is difficult to imagine that a system with far fewer banks would as effectively serve U.S. banking and credit needs and sufficiently to support economic growth. It is imperative that we keep the benefits of tailoring in focus as the bank regulatory framework evolves. A tailored regulatory and supervisory approach can help inform our policies on a wide range of industry issues that are likely to emerge in the coming years. Problem-Based SolutionsOne of the most difficult challenges on the regulatory front is prioritization, both for banks managing their businesses and for regulators deciding how to fulfill their responsibilities. At a basic level, the role of regulators is dictated by statute. Congress granted the Federal Reserve and other banking agencies broad statutory powers but has constrained how those powers may be directed through the use of statutory mandates, including to promote a safe and sound banking system, and broader U.S. financial stability. In the execution of these responsibilities, the Federal Reserve must also balance the need to act in a way that enables the banking system to serve the U.S. economy and promote economic growth. While these objectives are not incompatible, they do require us to consider tradeoffs when establishing policy. How can regulators best meet these responsibilities? As many of you may already know, I strongly believe in a pragmatic approach to policymaking.9This requires us to identify the problem we are trying to solve, determine whether we are the appropriate regulator to address the problem based on our statutory mandates and authorities, and explore options for addressing the identified issue. As a first step, we must be attuned to the banking system and how regulatory actions affect that system. We oversee a wide range of banks of varying sizes, activities, affiliates, and complexity. These banks interact with a range of service providers, financial market utilities, payments providers, and non-bank partners, regularly competing with non-bank financial intermediaries. The banking system can be a key driver of business formation, economic expansion, and opportunity. As we look at the banking system, including the regulatory framework, we must focus on those issues that are most important to advancing statutory priorities. There is always the risk of misidentification and mis-prioritization, and that we fail to take appropriately robust action on key issues or focus on issues that are less material to a bank's safety and soundness. Our goal should be to develop a better filter to promote appropriate and effective prioritization. FraudWe have seen several instances where this filter did not produce appropriate results, as we have recently seen with fraud. The incidence of fraud, particularly check fraud, has been rising substantially over the past few years, causing harm to banks, damaging the perceived safety of the banking system, and importantly hurting consumers who are the victims of fraudulent activity. Sometimes these efforts target vulnerable populations, like the elderly, who are particularly susceptible to certain forms of fraud. Despite this known problem, efforts by regulators have been frustratingly slow to advance, and seem to have done little to address the underlying root causes of this increase in fraud. Why has this important issue failed to garner greater attention from all of the appropriate regulatory and law enforcement bodies? Different governmental agencies may share an important role in addressing this problem, but the need for a joint and coordinated solution does not excuse collective inaction. Climate-Related Financial RiskOf course, not every issue falls within the scope of the Federal Reserve's responsibilities. Even when policymakers identify an issue or priority that they would like to pursue, it is imperative to ask whether that priority falls within the scope of our mandate and authorities. Statutes and regulations, paired with the "soft" power of examination, can be deployed in ways that may not be primarily directed towards the priorities mandated for banking regulators. I've noted previously that the banking agencies' climate-related financial risk guidance arguably pushes the boundaries of appropriate regulatory responsibilities. Banks have long been required to manage all material risks, including weather- and climate-related risks. And while this additional guidance seemed to do little to advance the goals of promoting the safe and sound operation of banks it, in effect, posed significant risks of influencing credit allocation decisions. Ultimately, banking regulators should not dictate credit allocation decisions, either by rule or through supervision. Bank regulatory policy should be used to address the needs of the unbanked and expand the availability of banking services. It should not be used to limit or exclude access to banking services for legitimate customers and businesses in a way that is meant to further unrelated policy goals, sometimes referred to as "de-banking." Once we have identified problems and determined that they are within the Fed's responsibility, we must consider alternative approaches to address them, focusing on identifying efficient solutions. New technologies and services often require novel regulatory and supervisory approaches, and we recognize that past approaches may not be effective. Often regulators take a "more is better" approach to regulation and guidance. Over the past several years, the banking industry has faced an onslaught of proposed and final regulations and guidance, materials that require a significant time commitment to review, to comment on, and to implement. Many times, these require changes to policies and procedures or risk management practices. It is critical that in our urgency to address issues in the banking system—particularly for community banks—that we consider not just the direct and indirect effects of regulatory action but also this cumulative burden. Community banks are resilient and dedicated to serving their communities, but at some point, the cumulative burden of the bank regulatory framework can adversely affect the availability and pricing of banking services and threaten the ongoing viability of the community bank model. The community banks in this country are important economically and to their communities, and we should strive to support these institutions and their ongoing viability. Other Notable Issues and ConcernsIn preparation for today's event, conference attendees were asked to submit questions in advance. So before concluding my remarks I'd like to address a few of these, since we won't be able to do a live Q&A session in this virtual format. Thank you for submitting your questions in advance. As community bankers, we are deeply invested in supporting the growth and resilience of our local economies. With ongoing regulatory pressures, what specific actions can the Federal Reserve take to ensure smaller institutions like ours remain competitive and capable of delivering the personalized service that our communities depend on?One of the things I think is critical in identifying how to support community banks is listening to the industry—which issues are top-of-mind for you? Being an effective regulator requires a degree of humility, and receptiveness to hearing about issues that affect the business of banking, particularly when there are alternative ways that regulators can better promote safety and soundness, or where regulatory actions have resulted in unintended consequences. At the same time, during my conversations with banks, a few themes have emerged that deserve attention. This will be a non-exclusive list, but hopefully will give you a sense of the types of issues and concerns that I hear about most frequently when talking to community banks. First, I think there is room to improve the transparency of regulatory communication. Banks should not be left to guess what regulators think about the permissibility of particular activities, or what parameters and rules should apply to those activities. Uncertainty discourages investments in innovation and the expansion of banking activities, products, and services, and can call into question whether internal processes and procedures are consistent with supervisory expectations. Banks already must confront the challenges of dealing with evolving economic and credit conditions, regulators should not compound these challenges through opaque expectations and standards. Second, I think we need to address shortcomings in the processing of banking applications, employing a more nimble and predictable approach specifically in the de novo formation and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) contexts. Today, the process to obtain regulatory approval can be influenced by many factors under a bank's control—for example, the completeness of the application filed and responsiveness to addressing questions and providing necessary additional information. However, the timeline for application decisions is often uncertain and beyond the bank's control. This can be due to questions about the minimum amount of capital needed and early-stage supervisory expectations (for a de novo bank), or uncertainty about the competitive effects of a transaction, or the filing of a public comment raising concerns about an application in the M&A context. Finally, I think regulatory and supervisory "trickle-down" is real and it has significantly harmed community banks. I am referring to regulators conveying expectations to community banks (for example, during the examination process) that lack a foundation in applicable rules or guidance, or that were designed for larger institutions, or based on a horizontal review of unique banks. It is very difficult to insulate community banks from the harmful consequences of "trickle-down," and broader structural changes may be needed to shield them from inapplicable and unreasonable expectations. At the same time, we must preserve strong supervisory standards as banks cross asset thresholds, so banks that grow larger and riskier are subject to appropriately tailored and calibrated requirements and expectations. I would also note that some degree of "trickle down" has occurred over time because the regulatory asset "line" defining community banks has remained constant at $10 billion in assets for over a decade. During that time, the economy has grown significantly, and inflation has rendered this asset definition obsolete. Many "community banks"—as defined by business model and activities rather than asset size—now exceed the threshold and must comply with broader regulatory requirements that may be excessive. What support or guidance can community banks expect from the Federal Reserve as we navigate technological innovation and increased cybersecurity threats?Both innovation and cybersecurity are issues that are top of mind for me. Innovation has always been a priority for banks of all sizes and business models. Banks in the U.S. have a long history of developing and implementing new technologies, and innovation has the potential to make the banking and payments systems faster and more efficient, to bring new products and services to customers, and even to enhance safety and soundness. Regulators must be open to innovation in the banking system. Our goal should be to build and support a clear and sensible regulatory framework that anticipates ongoing and evolving innovation—one that allows the private sector to innovate while also maintaining appropriate safeguards. We must promote innovation through transparency and open communication, including demonstrating a willingness to engage during the development process. By providing clarity and consistency, we can encourage long-term business investment, while also continuing to support today's products and services. A clear regulatory framework would also empower supervisors to focus on safety and soundness, while ensuring a safe and efficient banking and payment system. On cybersecurity, banks often note cybersecurity and third-party risk management as areas that raise significant concerns. Cyber-related events, including ransomware attacks and business email compromises, are costly in terms of expense and reputation, and are time-consuming events that pose unique challenges for community banks. The maintenance of cyber assets and technology resources required to support a successful cybersecurity program are often difficult for smaller banks. Regulators can promote cybersecurity, and stronger cyber-incident "resilience" and response capabilities by identifying resources and opportunities, such as exercises, for banks to develop "muscle memory" in cyber incident response. The Federal Reserve plays an important role in supervising banks and supporting risk management practices. For example, the Federal Reserve hosts the Midwest Cyber Workshop, with the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.10Over the past couple of years, this workshop has provided a forum to discuss cyber risk among community bankers, regulators, law enforcement, and other industry stakeholders. Community banks can also turn to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) website, which includes the FFIEC Cybersecurity Resource Guide and links to other external cybersecurity resources. We know well that cyber threats pose real risks to the banking system, and we recognize that community banks may have unique needs in preventing, remediating, and responding to cyber threats. Regulators should, therefore, ensure that a range of resources are available to support banks and seek further opportunities to help build bank resilience against these threats. Community banks are integral to rural and underserved communities. How can the Federal Reserve support us in maintaining our presence in these areas, particularly amid ongoing consolidation trends?As I noted earlier, it is essential that the U.S. banking system is broad and diverse, including institutions of all sizes serving all the different markets across the country. Community banks play a particularly valuable role in rural and underserved communities, and we need to ensure that the community banking model remains viable into the future. To do that, we need to have a regulatory system in which both de novo bank formations and M&A transactions are possible. Viable formation and merger options for banks of all sizes are necessary to avoid creating a "barbell" of the very largest and very smallest banks in the banking system, with the number of community banks continuing to erode over time. M&A ensures that banks have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. In the absence of a viable M&A framework, there is potential for additional risks, including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities. Uncertainty related to the M&A process also may act as a deterrent to de novo bank formation, as potential bank founders may stay on the sidelines knowing that future exit strategies—like the strategic acquisition of a de novo bank by a larger peer—may face long odds of success. Another challenge particularly in rural markets are the competitive "screens" that are used to evaluate the competitive effects of a proposed merger. Using these screens often results in a finding that M&A transactions in rural markets can have an adverse effect on competition and should therefore be disallowed.11Even when these transactions are eventually approved, the mechanical approach to analyzing competitive effects often requires additional review or analysis and can lead to extensive delays in the regulatory approval process. Reducing the efficiency of the bank M&A process can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions—it can reduce the effectiveness of M&A and de novo activity that preserves the presence of community banks in underserved areas, prevent institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and actually undermine competition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale. 1.

Governor Christopher J. Waller At Lectures of the Governor, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Paris, France Thank you, Alvaro, and thank you for the honor of initiating this new series of lectures from central bankers.1I will begin with a few words on the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy. But on this occasion, I thought it appropriate to then widen my perspective, to address what I see as the leading challenges that OECD economies face that are of particular importance to central bankers in how we approach monetary policy and our other responsibilities. I continue to believe that the U.S. economy is on a solid footing. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been above 2 percent for eight of the last nine quarters and is expected to grow above 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024. Despite this robust economic growth, the labor market softened over 2024, and employment is now near what I judge to be the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) maximum-employment objective. I have seen nothing in the data or forecasts that suggests the labor market will dramatically weaken over coming months. With regard to inflation, after a period of rapid disinflation in 2022 and 2023, progress appears to have stalled in the final months of 2024. Our latest reading of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation is 2.8 percent for the 12 months ending in November. This is down just a bit from where it was a year earlier, at 3.2 percent. This minimal further progress has led to calls to slow or stop reducing the policy rate. However, I believe that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent goal over the medium term and that further reductions will be appropriate. Let me explain why I expect inflation to continue toward our goal. First, as we saw a year ago when inflation briefly increased, progress has been uneven, but disinflation is more apparent if one smooths through the recent upticks. To tease out the underlying trend in inflation, I often look at the six-month percent change in core PCE prices, which is 2.4 percent at an annual rate for November and has mostly been moving down toward 2 percent over the course of the year. Second, the monthly reading for November came in much lower than expected at 0.11 percent after rising 0.26 percent in October. Third, inflation in 2024 has largely been driven by increases in imputed prices, such as housing services and nonmarket services, which are estimated rather than directly observed and I consider a less reliable guide to the balance of supply and demand across all goods and services in the economy. These two categories represent about one-third of the core PCE basket. If you look at the prices associated with the other two-thirds of core PCE, they on average increased less than 2 percent over the past 12 months through November. I don't support ignoring our best measures of prices for housing and non-market services, but I find it notable thatimputedprices, rather thanobservedprices, were driving inflation in 2024 and thus expectations of the policy rate path. Finally, the higher inflation readings from early in 2024 will begin to drop out of inflation numbers in January. This should result in a significant step-down in the 12-month inflation numbers through March. Looking further forward, geopolitical conflict could boost prices, as it has at times in recent years. In addition, tariff proposals raise the possibility that a new source of upward pressure on inflation could emerge in the coming year. Projections of the economic impact of these possible policy changes vary widely. If, as I expect, tariffs do not have a significant or persistent effect on inflation, they are unlikely to affect my view of appropriate monetary policy. Of course, we need to see what policies are enacted before we can seriously consider their effects. So what is my view? If the outlook evolves as I have described here, I will support continuing to cut our policy rate in 2025. The pace of those cuts will depend on how much progress we make on inflation, while keeping the labor market from weakening. Based on the most recent Summary of Economic Projections, the median of policymakers' expected appropriate policy rate this year implies two 25 basis point cuts.2But the range of views is quite large, from no cuts to as many as five cuts for different FOMC participants. As always, the extent of further easing will depend on what the data tell us about progress toward 2 percent inflation, but my bottom-line message is that I believe more cuts will be appropriate. Let me now turn to what I consider some of the leading challenges that will frame monetary policy actions for OECD members in 2025 and beyond. Each of the issues I raise are sizable challenges for all OECD countries, but some are bigger challenges in some places than others. I have not tried to rank these challenges in importance, so please don't take any signal from the order in which they are raised. I will start with the ongoing challenge all central banks face in reaching our targets for inflation. While 12-month measures of headline inflation are close to target in most jurisdictions, most central banks target inflation in the medium term, and indicators of the trajectory of future price changes, such as core inflation, are still running persistently above target. Like the Federal Reserve, most central banks in OECD economies are gradually easing monetary policy as inflation falls. I believe policy is still restrictive in most cases, which should support the goals of policymakers to have inflation at their targets going forward. This common challenge, in the months ahead, has its roots, as we all know, in the common experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic conditions before and during the pandemic varied widely across OECD economies, as did the focus, timing, and forcefulness of policy responses. The surge in inflation during the pandemic was the result of both supply and demand factors, and while the timing of the inflation surge varied across countries, the COVID inflation was largely a global phenomenon, as shown by research conducted by Federal Reserve staff.3 A common factor that drove inflation across our economies was the disruption of goods production and delivery.4Shortages of key components and waves of COVID variants repeatedly disrupted supply chains, causing inflation to persist. Fortunately, these disruptions have receded, and delivery times have returned to pre-pandemic levels. That said, there are many geopolitical factors that are still keeping deliveries of supplies volatile, which potentially could affect economic activity and inflation. Another common experience has been the fiscal response to the pandemic. The extent to which the fiscal policies rolled out in support of households and businesses during the pandemic contributed to inflation is the subject of ongoing debate.5Regardless of their effects on inflation, fiscal policy actions across OECD countries led to a doubling and tripling of budget deficits as a percentage of GDP with even larger percentages in some places. Those deficits have steadily fallen since then but are still higher in many countries than before the pandemic, and debt levels have grown for many OECD members. Another recent challenge for OECD economies is the widespread weakness in manufacturing. Manufacturing boomed in many places with the onset of the pandemic, when consumers switched their spending from in-person services to goods. But as businesses and economies reopened with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions, the swing to service spending by consumers began what has been a sustained slide in manufacturing in OECD economies. This slide has been compounded by three other factors. First, because manufacturing is capital intensive, interest rate increases over the past couple of years raised capital costs in this sector. As monetary policy eases across countries, this effect may unwind. Also, higher energy costs after Russia's attack on Ukraine have hurt manufacturing more than other sectors. And lastly, China's push to reduce its reliance on imports and expand its global market share in sectors such as autos has had a big impact across OECD economies. While the manufacturing sector is a smaller share of economic activity in the United States than in some other OECD countries, we shall see whether the weakness in global manufacturing is affected by the prospect of changes in trade policy in the U.S. and elsewhere. The extent and timing of tariffs are highly uncertain, as are the effects. Overall, the evolution of manufacturing adds uncertainty to the forecasts of central bankers' outlooks. A short-to-medium-term challenge that is and will remain widespread among OECD countries is geopolitical risk. Indexes of geopolitical risk suggest that risks are elevated, but not nearly as high as they were when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Today however, you certainly can't see much evidence for geopolitical risk affecting financial markets. But geopolitical risk will nevertheless remain a challenge that central bankers will need to keep in mind. The outbreak of war in Europe and, more recently, in the Middle East were shocking developments that continue to reverberate, as we have seen recently in Syria. It is unclear how these events will ultimately affect security, trade, and migration flows around the world. The fact that these conflicts have not affected the global economy to a greater extent than they have so far doesn't mean they can't and won't. Research shows that higher levels of geopolitical risk, and economic uncertainty more broadly, tend to foreshadow lower investment and employment.6I expect that central bankers in OECD economies will continue to consider geopolitical risk in the medium term. The next challenge for central bankers that I would like to address also has both shorter and long-term dimensions to it, and that is something that I will refer to as a "rethink of globalization." For close to a decade now, many countries have been reexamining the costs and benefits from steadily freer global movement in capital, labor, and goods that was the norm over previous decades. Although global trade has not decreased in the last decade, we have clearly seen changes in trade patterns, with more countries and firms putting greater emphasis on rerouting trade flows and shortening supply chains to avoid geopolitical risk and tariffs. This isn't simply the result of some failed ministerial meeting or bilateral conflict. Rather, it has been a persistent and widespread trend that has been under way for some time. The presumption that the increasingly tighter global integration of our economies and financial markets would inevitably continue is no longer as safe as it long was. At the same time, I have refrained from calling this development, as some have, the "end of globalization," because I don't believe that this will be the outcome. As I think about the 38 governments represented by the OECD and consider how this organization has grown in size and in the depth of its engagement on different issues, I would say that globalization is not going away. What I do expect, however, is there will be more thought and consideration among our leaders for how globalization affects the people we serve, with a more careful weighing of both the potential costs of closer integration and the potential benefits. As these decisions by governments are made, central bankers will need to be prepared to respond appropriately in setting monetary policy and promoting financial stability. Another longer-term challenge involves demographic trends. What I mean here is the aging of populations in OECD countries, and, to some extent, everywhere else. While this is mainly a problem for fiscal authorities, it does have some ramifications for central bankers in terms of long-run growth rates, productivity, and asset prices. In the United States, those between the ages of 16 and 54 were 72 percent of the population in 2003, 62.7 percent in 2023, and are projected to be 61 percent in 2033. Aging is happening even more quickly in some other OECD countries. This is a slow-moving development but, as populations age and move from working to retirement, employment and economic output fall. This by itself lowers per capita GDP, which can affect consumption, investment and inflation. As aging populations sell accumulated assets to support consumption, asset prices and interest rates will adjust as well, with the latter potentially affecting the central bank's estimate of the neutral policy rate. There are mitigants to soften the effect of aging populations, such as an increase in retirement age, immigration and higher productivity growth for younger workers. Again, these demographic factors are more important for fiscal policy, but there are spillovers to monetary policy. Productivity growth is another issue facing central bankers and I know has been the subject of conversations at OECD gatherings this past year. According to one set of estimates, labor productivity growth is responsible for more than half of the cumulative GDP growth in the United States since the end of 2019, compared to much smaller shares in other countries. Productivity growth is notoriously volatile and, even years later, it is hard to say exactly what technological and other factors caused it.7Having some understanding of the trajectory of productivity growth is helpful for policymakers thinking about how fast their economies can grow without inducing inflation. Central bankers must keep their eyes on productivity in judging whether wages can grow quickly without igniting inflation or whether potential growth has increased. Productivity growth also plays a role in assessing the real neutral policy rate, otherwise known as r*. Higher productivity growth is often associated with a higher value of r* for some policymakers and thus has implications for the interpretation of the degree of monetary accommodation or restrictiveness for policy.8 One way to try to understand some of the factors affecting productivity is to compare the United States to other OECD countries. While it is not particularly new for productivity to grow faster in the U.S. than in other advanced economies, some differences in our economies may have been particularly salient during and after the pandemic.9First, there was more disruption in employment in the United States during COVID than in many other OECD countries and after the pandemic subsided this may have led to better matching of workers with new jobs at which they could be more productive. Second, during the acute U.S. labor shortages in 2022 and 2023, I heard numerous anecdotes that firms had to invest more in worker training to raise skill levels to what was necessary for positions. This raises labor productivity with a delay, and it may have been an important factor recently. Third, business creation is, by all evidence, easier in the United States, and new firms often are more productive than existing firms. There was a surge in U.S. business creation after COVID, which could reasonably have led to a more productive re-allocation of labor. There may have been other factors. I don't think that artificial intelligence (AI) was one of them. AI investment will take place over many years and most likely has not done much yet to add to productive capacity. While it is possible AI could increase longer-run productivity growth, that remains to be seen. But the other possible reasons—the flexibility of labor rules, ease of business entry, barriers to innovation, lower regulatory hurdles—would sound familiar to people attending OECD discussions a decade ago. The barriers to innovative risk-taking are probably lower—and the rewards higher—in the United States. So while I am skeptical that AI is already making significant contributions to productivity growth, I have little doubt that it will do so. AI and allied innovations in computing have the potential to bring productivity advances to high-skill labor-intensive services, akin to the way robotics transformed high-skill manufacturing. If such advances do occur, one challenge for governments will be fostering an economy in which those dislocated by such a shift can obtain new skills and find productive and meaningful employment. As ever, prudent regulation should be balanced with support for innovation that has the potential to deliver widespread improvements in living standards. But regulatory policy should not strangle innovation in its infancy. So, at the end of this list of challenges, how should central banks meet them? There will always be new challenges, but the right approach to monetary policy hasn't changed, nor should it. In every case, the answer begins with sticking to our mandates and resisting the temptation to go beyond them. We must closely monitor economic and financial conditions and look in every direction, and down the road, for emerging risks. In keeping to our mandates, we concede that seeing all these risks clearly is hard, so we need to remain focused. We also need to be nimble in responding to unfamiliar risks and be prepared to use our monetary policy tools in new ways to prepare for unprecedented challenges that may present themselves. When conditions are uncertain, as they often are, we must move deliberately but also be ready to act quickly and decisively when the situation demands it, as we did in subduing inflation. Effective monetary policy depends on clearly communicating our intentions so that the public will act on those intentions. That also requires credibility, and this is most effectively maintained when monetary policy decisions are made according to our mandates and in the longer-term interest of a healthy economy and stable financial system. Guided by these basic principles, I believe that central bankers are up to the considerable challenges of today, and those we will face in the years ahead. 1.

The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of the California wildfires and straight-line winds on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the current disaster areas can be found athttps://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations. Lending:The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas are supported by the agencies and should not be subject to examiner criticism. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty should be accounted for as a new loan or a continuance of an existing loan. In making this evaluation, institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and appropriately report the modification in the institution's call report. In supervising institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities:The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter. Publishing Requirements:The agencies understand that the damage caused by the California wildfires and straight-line winds may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements:Institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the California wildfires and straight-line winds. The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA):Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment athttps://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm. Investments:Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments. For more information, refer to theInteragency Supervisory Examiner Guidance for Institutions Affected by a Major Disaster, which is available as follows: FDIC:https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2017/fil17062a.pdf FRB:https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1714a1.pdf NCUA:https://www.ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/letters-credit-unions-other-guidance/examiner-guidance-institutions-affected-major-disaster OCC:https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2017/bulletin-2017-61.html State financial regulators:https://www.csbs.org/interagency-supervisory-examiner-guidance-institutions-affected-major-disaster Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Resources: California Wildfires

The Federal Reserve Board announced on Monday that Michael S. Barr will step down from his position as Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair for Supervision, effective February 28, 2025, or such earlier time as a successor is confirmed. Barr will continue to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Barr, who has served as vice chair for supervision since July 19, 2022, submitted his letter of resignation to President Joseph R. Biden. "It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as the Federal Reserve Board's vice chair for supervision, and to work with colleagues to help maintain the stability and strength of the U.S. financial system so that it can meet the needs of American families and businesses," Vice Chair for Supervision Barr said. "The position of vice chair for supervision was created after the Global Financial Crisis to create greater responsibility, transparency, and accountability for the Federal Reserve's supervision and regulation of the financial system. The risk of a dispute over the position could be a distraction from our mission. In the current environment, I've determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor." The Board does not intend to take up any major rulemakings until a vice chair for supervision successor is confirmed. As vice chair for supervision, Barr oversaw the supervision and regulation of financial firms in the Board's jurisdiction and collaborated with other bank regulators to ensure the banking system remained a source of strength, despite stresses in early 2023. Prior to his appointment, Barr held multiple positions at the University of Michigan through several decades, including serving as the Dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, and as a professor of law, where he taught financial regulation and international finance. He served in the U.S. Department of the Treasury several times in senior policy roles and earlier clerked for Justice David H. Souter on the U.S. Supreme Court. He graduated from Yale University, Oxford University, and Yale Law School. A copy of his letter resigning from the position of vice chair for supervision is attached.

Governor Michelle W. Bowman At the California Bankers Association 2025 Bank Presidents Seminar, Laguna Beach, California Let me begin by recognizing the devastation caused by the fires in the Los Angeles area. My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been impacted and the first responders who are fighting to bring the fires under control. I would like to thank the California Bankers Association for the invitation to speak to you today.1I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on the past year, on both the path of monetary policy and the economy and on how this past experience can inform the bank regulatory agenda as we look ahead to a new year. In light of the policy decisions at the last few Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, I will begin by providing some perspective on my votes and then discuss my current views on the economy and monetary policy. Update on the Most Recent FOMC MeetingsAt the September meeting last year, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate, for the first time since we began tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. Although I was unable to support such a large cut at that time, I did agree with the Committee's assessment that it was appropriate to begin the process of recalibrating policy to reflect the progress in both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market since the middle of 2023. My dissent favored a smaller initial cut to begin the recalibration process and was the first FOMC dissent by a Board member in nearly 20 years. I explained my reasoning in a statement published after the meeting that noted that moving the policy rate down too quickly would carry the risk of unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures. In addition, since inflation continues to hover well above our 2 percent goal, there was a real risk that the Committee's large policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. At both our November and December meetings, the Committee lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, bringing it to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. I supported the December policy action because, in my view, it represented the Committee's final step in the policy recalibration phase. The target range now reflects 100 basis points of cuts since September, and the policy rate is now closer to my estimate of its neutral level, which is higher than before the pandemic. But given the lack of continued progress on lowering inflation and the ongoing strength in economic activity and in the labor market, I could have supported taking no action at the December meeting. Still, I am pleased that the post-meeting statement continued to reference a flexible and data-dependent approach for considering future policy adjustments. It is important that we remain focused on returning inflation to 2 percent. I expect that the coming months should bring clarity on the incoming administration's policies and the carry over of inflationary pressures from 2024, reflecting private spending decisions and an apparent faster spend-out of existing federal government appropriations in recent months. It will be very important to understand how these factors will affect economic activity and inflation going forward. The Economy Towards the End of 2024 and Risks to the OutlookThe U.S. economy remained strong through the end of last year, with solid growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment. However, core inflation remains elevated, and I continue to see upside risks to inflation. The rate of inflation declined significantly in 2023, but this progress appears to have stalled last year with core inflation still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation—which excludes food and energy prices—moved back up to 2.8 percent in October and November, only slightly below its 3.0 percent reading at the end of 2023. Progress has stalled since the spring of last year mostly due to a slowing in core goods price declines. Persistently elevated core inflation continues to reflect pressures on housing services prices, possibly due to an increase in demand for affordable housing amid an inelastic supply. It also appears to be originating from a few other major components in recent months, such as in goods and in services with imputed prices. Gross domestic product increased at a solid pace in the third quarter, maintaining the momentum from the previous four quarters. Growth continued to be driven by private domestic final purchases, as personal consumption, and retail sales in particular, strongly increased in the third quarter, more than offsetting further weakness in housing activity due to high mortgage rates. The latest data suggest continued strength in consumer spending in the fourth quarter as retail sales and sales of light vehicles continued to rise appreciably. Post-election consumer sentiment appears to be improving, but it remains well below pre-pandemic levels likely because of higher prices. And since housing, food, and energy price increases have far outpaced overall inflation since the pandemic, lower-income households have experienced the negative impacts of inflation hardest, especially as these households have limited options to trade down for lower-cost goods and services. The most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains rebounded in November, following a temporary drag in October from hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Boeing strike. On balance, job gains averaged about 130,000 over those two months, a pace only slightly below the average gains in the second and third quarters. The unemployment rate rose to a still low 4.2 percent in November, but it has moved sideways since July. While unemployment is notably higher than in 2023, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment, and we will receive the December employment report tomorrow. The labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has remained close to the historically elevated pre-pandemic level in recent months. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 had only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength. Wage growth remains indicative of a tight labor market and above the pace consistent with our inflation goal. The rise in the unemployment rate last year largely reflected weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force took longer to find work, while layoffs remained low. Although there has been some cooling in labor demand and the labor force participation rate declined a bit further in November, the household survey may have failed to capture the usual seasonal hiring ahead of the holidays due to the unusually early survey week and the late Thanksgiving holiday. More concerningly, the labor market data have become increasingly difficult to interpret, as surveys and other measurements struggle to incorporate large numbers of new workers and to accurately account for other influences. As the dynamics of immigration and business creation and closures continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to interpret the monthly data from the payroll and household surveys. It is crucial that U.S. official data accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real time, such as those in recent years, so we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. In the meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases. Turning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains near full employment, but it is possible that we could see a deterioration in labor market conditions. Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to shocks, including labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, namely in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. The potential release of pent-up demand following the election, especially with improving consumer and business sentiment, could also present inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it is not my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall. The Path ForwardLooking ahead, we should be cautious in considering changes to the policy rate as we move toward a more neutral setting. Future actions should be based on a careful assessment of ongoing and sustained progress in achieving our goals, and we must be clear in our communication about how further changes are intended to affect economic conditions. We should also refrain from prejudging the incoming administration's future policies. Instead, we should wait for more clarity and then seek to understand the effects on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation. I also continue to be concerned that the current stance of policy may not be as restrictive as others may see it. Given the ongoing strength in the economy, it seems unlikely that the overall level of interest rates and borrowing costs are providing meaningful restraint. With equity prices more than 20 percent higher than a year ago, easier financial conditions may be contributing to the lack of further progress on slowing inflation. In fact, concerns about inflation risks seem to partly explain the recent notable increase in the 10-year Treasury yield back to values last seen in the spring of 2024. In light of these considerations, I continue to prefer a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy. Looking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time of our next meeting later this month, we will have seen new reports on consumer and producer price inflation. In addition to closely watching the incoming data and broader financial conditions, I will continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. It is also important to clearly explain how we consider progress in meeting our inflation and employment goals in our policy deliberations. Restoring price stability is essential for fostering a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term. Approach to Bank Regulatory PolicyTurning to banking, I will start by sharing my thoughts on bank supervision and regulation. This year will see a transition in leadership at the banking agencies, and I expect that this will translate into a shift in priorities and approach. I am optimistic that by working collaboratively to focus on our statutory mandates, the banking agencies can improve how we fulfill our responsibilities in a fair, efficient, and accountable way. Adopting a more pragmatic approach to policymaking, one that imposes discipline in the exercise of the extensive powers and important responsibilities granted by Congress, would be most effective.2 Public debates about the bank regulatory framework routinely focus on whether regulators are being "hard enough" on banks, or whether the framework is too "lenient." Framing the debate this way suggests a binary approach that ignores the known tradeoffs in any regulatory action—like raising capital requirements or downgrading a bank's management rating for minor issues to show "toughness." This approach interprets a rational prioritization of regulatory matters as being too bank friendly. While policy views may differ, policy debates should not misinterpret the dynamic of how banks and regulators should operate. In short, bank regulation and supervision need not be an adversarial system, with banks and regulators acting in opposition. Rather, banks and regulators often have the shared goal of a banking system that is safe, sound, and effective, with each serving an important role in furthering these objectives. As we move away from this type of binary thinking, that leaves the question of how regulators can best accomplish their statutory objectives. As a starting point, we must identify the objectives we are trying to achieve. In conducting bank regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve has the important responsibility of promoting the safe and sound operation of individual banks and the stability of the broader financial system. In many cases, these goals are complementary. When individual banks operate in a safe and sound manner, the banking system generally promotes the stability of the U.S. financial system. Of course, these objectives require a degree of balance if we want the banking system to serve the U.S. economy and facilitate economic growth. When we promote safety and soundness—for example by raising capital requirements—that has an effect on the aggregate lending capacity of the banking system and the availability of credit, particularly for less qualified borrowers. We must approach the task of bank regulation with an understanding and appreciation of these tradeoffs, coupled with an affirmative acknowledgment that the banking system is an important driver of business formation, economic expansion, and opportunity. We have the same responsibility to understand and appreciate the tradeoffs when we exercise our supervisory authority. I am optimistic about the future of banking in the United States and believe that the banking regulators can support the banking system by adopting a more pragmatic approach. While this is a non-exclusive list, I continue to believe the areas that we should focus on should include (1) prioritizing safety and soundness, (2) renewing our commitment to regulatory tailoring, and (3) increasing transparency.3 Prioritization of Safety and SoundnessIn 2024, bank regulators were still operating under the shadow of the 2023 bank failures, particularly the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The risks facing SVB—interest rate and funding risks, rapid growth, and the idiosyncratic business model and concentrated customer base of the bank—have long been important issues that have been prioritized during examinations. At its root, SVB's failure exposed significant flaws not only in the bank's management but also in the approach to oversight and supervision. As we approach regulatory and supervisory reform from the perspective of pragmatism, we need to take a close look at what went wrong and what could be fixed. Regulatory tools to improve management are imperfect and may be limited in their effectiveness before a bank has failed, but we have great latitude to modify our approach to supervision. One pragmatic change would be to prioritize safety and soundness and deprioritize matters that are not essential to—or that are tangential to—our statutory obligations. After SVB's failure, we saw a wide range of regulatory proposals. These have included substantial increases in bank capital requirements and pushing down global systemically important bank (G-SIB) and large bank requirements to much smaller firms. They have also included finding supervisory deficiencies in the management of well-capitalized and financially sound firms and considering widespread changes to the funding and liquidity requirements and expectations that apply to all banks. Many of these proposals have targeted concerns well beyond remediating issues identified during the 2023 banking stress but have been justified in a generic way—at least in part—as a "response" to the failure of SVB. In many cases, the nexus between a proposed reform and how that reform would remediate any of the underlying issues that caused the failure of SVB or caused stress in the broader banking system is not clearly articulated. When the agencies pursue reforms, it is critical that the problem is clearly identified and that an explanation is given for how each proposal would address the problem. We should not characterize all reforms as "crisis response" actions, as doing so does not relieve us of the responsibility to analyze and justify the tradeoffs and alternatives of any particular measure. There is substantial room for agreement and consensus. We all want a banking system that can effectively provide credit, including to underserved consumers and businesses. We all want a banking system that is resilient in the face of changing economic conditions. We all want a banking system in which banks are free to experiment and innovate to better serve their customers. And we all want a banking system in which banks are held to high but economically reasonable standards in terms of capital, risk management and compliance. The process of any reform or change to the bank regulatory framework should begin with an identification of the problem, followed by an analysis of whether proposed solutions are within the agency's statutory authorities, and an evaluation of whether targeted changes could result in improvements, remediation of gaps, or elimination of redundant and unnecessary requirements. The resulting framework will better promote safety and soundness in a more durable and consistent way over time, while also continuing to support economic growth. Renewed Commitment to TailoringLike you, I firmly believe in the virtues of tailoring not only as a statutory responsibility but as a key to forming sensible and effective bank regulatory policy.4Tailoring can help ensure regulators focus on the most critical risks over time and avoid the over-allocation of resources or imposition of unnecessary costs on the banking system. Tailoring also allows us to allocate limited supervisory resources to most effectively support safety and soundness of the banking system and U.S. financial stability. The Federal Reserve has not only statutory responsibilities established by Congress, but a responsibility to use our resources efficiently and effectively in the execution of our duties. Over the past two years, we have seen proposals that would materially reduce the tailoring of regulatory requirements, particularly as it relates to capital (the so-called Basel III "endgame" reforms) and new long-term debt requirements that would apply to all banks with over $100 billion in assets. Both proposals raise significant policy questions as to whether the costs are justified by the benefits—questions not sufficiently addressed in the proposals—and pose significant risks of unintended consequences. Essentially, this type of approach to capital "flattens" requirements across large banks. And coupled with other potential reforms to liquidity and funding requirements, this approach could lead to substantial industry consolidation as medium-sized banks weigh the benefits and costs to comply with an aggregate set of requirements more suitable for the largest banks. We should be cautious of these types of piecemeal regulatory proposals and instead think more holistically about the aggregate impacts as part of our process. Tailoring also plays an important role in supervision, an area that historically has differentiated expectations for firms based on size, business model, risk profile, and complexity. These criteria provide a reasonable basis to take a different approach based on the unique characteristics of each bank, and as banks shift in size and evolve in business model and risk, it is appropriate to recalibrate expectations. However, I see a growing risk that under the veil of supervision, there has been an erosion of a risk-based approach, and effectively a "push-down" of regulatory requirements designed and calibrated for larger firms to apply to smaller firms. I continue to believe that tailoring should be a central tenet of our regulatory and supervisory approach and framework and believe that we must renew our commitment to this philosophy going forward. I am confident that going forward, regulators will return to regulatory tailoring, particularly for community banks with straightforward business models. Increasing TransparencyRegulators should operate in a transparent way and carefully and meticulously follow administrative procedures when making revisions to the regulatory framework. We should take a similar approach to shifts in supervisory focus. Doing so promotes trust and accountability to the public and should be integral to the important work we do promoting the safe and sound operation of the banking system and financial stability. Transparency also promotes innovation in the financial system by enabling banks to understand how to engage in new activities. This is especially important as digital assets and artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly more prevalent in the financial system. A deliberate, transparent, and fact-based approach to pursuing statutory objectives helps us "show our work," that we are focused on pursuing our policy goals, and are avoiding straying into political concerns outside of statutory purposes or functions. Promoting safety, soundness, and financial stability should not devolve into an exercise of regulatory allocation of credit—picking winners and losers—or promoting an ideological position through more open-ended processes like bank supervision and examination. Transparency promotes fairness, as regulated entities and the public can better understand why and how our actions further our goals. When we identify areas that suffer from a lack of transparency, we should act promptly to address those concerns. Take, for example, the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress testing process. On December 23, the Fed announced that it would soon seek public comment on "significant changes" to the stress testing process designed to improve transparency of the tests and reduce volatility of the resulting stress capital buffers that apply to large financial institutions.5Given my longstanding support for revisiting the stress testing framework to promote transparency and reduce volatility, I am pleased with this development.6 Transparency can lead to better public engagement and outcomes and should be a central part of the regulatory and supervisory approach, even when not legally mandated, such as in supervision. Supervision involves examiners probing bank operations and assessing a bank's approach to risk and risk management. Much of this information is confidential and commercially sensitive and, therefore, not available to the public or released without risking some degree of harm to the institution. But the confidential nature and approach to supervision tends to result in a wide range of information being categorized as confidential supervisory information (CSI) and subject to restrictions on sharing. This information ends up being shielded from public scrutiny and becomes a barrier to banks engaging in discussion with peers and other regulators to better understand supervisory expectations. Supervisory expectations should not surprise regulated firms, and yet changes in supervisory expectations often arise in the course of an ongoing examination. As a result, the ability of a financial institution to be proactive—to work to meet any new expectations—is impossible until they have received supervisory feedback, often in the form of a supervisory finding or matter requiring attention or, in extreme cases, in a formal or informal supervisory action. I am not suggesting that there are always simple solutions to improve transparency, and certainly it is appropriate that much of the information developed in the supervisory process remains shielded as confidential supervisory information. But regulators must also acknowledge the new world in which we operate, one in which administrative law increasingly demands greater transparency and accountability to act as a check on regulatory overreach. Closing ThoughtsThank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts on the economy and bank regulatory matters with you today. In the coming months, I look forward to seeing the impacts of the new administration's policies on the economy and assessing how monetary policy should respond going forward. Today, the U.S. economy begins the new year on a strong footing, with still elevated inflation and a solid labor market. The new year brings an opportunity to reflect on the experience and lessons learned in the past few years and to take a critical look at improving the bank regulatory framework, including both supervision and regulation. And while I have laid out a few broad areas that I think deserve special attention—focusing on safety and soundness, renewing our commitment to tailoring, and improving transparency—my hope is that the steps we take to improve the regulatory framework in the future focus on pragmatism as a guiding principle. 1.
