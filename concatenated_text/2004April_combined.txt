Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke Financial education and Jump$tart survey At the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy and Federal Reserve Board joint news conference, Washington, D.C. April 1, 2004 Good morning and welcome to the Board Room. A little more than two weeks ago, the Federal Open Market Committee gathered at this table and debated the future course of monetary policy. Its statement afterward was transmitted instantly around the globe to millions of people. Journalists, investors and others, understandably, thought of the topics discussed around this table on that day as important. I wouldn't contradict that assumption, but there is a sense in which our topic today--the financial education of our young people--is even more important. Our economy can become ever more prosperous and our financial system ever more sophisticated, but if our young people lack the knowledge with which to make wise choices--for their present and their future--they will not be able to share in the benefits of the advancing economy and financial system. I say this not only from the perspective of a Federal Reserve policymaker, but as a former economics professor, a former member of the Montgomery Township, New Jersey, school board, and, most importantly, as the current parent of two young adults. And, I know many others join me in the conviction that financial education is crucial. This month has been designated by the Senate as Financial Literacy Month. The Federal Reserve is involved with financial education on many fronts. Allow me to mention just a few of our "products" and "services." Reserve Banks around the country conduct workshops for teachers. The Board joined with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond last summer in sponsoring one here, "Teaching Teens About Money." We also seek to provide information to adults. By now, I hope many of you have seen our public service announcement, launched last year. The theme is "There's a Lot to Learn About Money" and it stars Chairman Greenspan. Look for our pamphlet, in English and Spanish, on the Federal Reserve education web site ( ). It's filled with tips for taking charge of your personal finances. Finally, research is an important component of financial education. If we are to succeed in spreading financial knowledge, educators and others must empirically analyze knowledge gaps and the results of their efforts to fill them. Fortunately, this body of research is growing. To track it, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's Consumer and Economic Development Research and Information Center (CEDRIC) has created an for financial education and literacy research. The assessing high school students' financial knowledge that the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy is releasing today is a very useful contribution to that research. Let me now turn to Dara Duguay, the coalition's executive director, to give you a status report on the financial literacy movement in this country.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced its approval of the applications filed under the Bank Holding Company Act by Manulife Financial Corporation, Toronto, Canada, to become a bank holding company and acquire John Hancock Financial Services, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, and thereby indirectly acquire First Signature Bank and Trust Company, Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and by John Hancock Financial Services, Inc., to become a bank holding company and retain control of First Signature Bank and Trust Company. Attached is the Board's Order relating to these actions.

Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. At the Twelfth District Community Leaders Luncheon, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, California April 8, 2004 Macroeconomic Outlook and Uncertainties It is a pleasure to be with you today to speak about the current state of the U.S. economy. As you know, the economy appears to be engaged in a gradual process of recovery. As has often been the case in previous recoveries, however, the pace and breadth of the expansion thus far have been uneven. In particular, production and aggregate income have increased strongly in the past few quarters, but the labor market has been surprisingly weak. The most recent data suggest that the labor market is improving gradually; but the question of whether this improvement is fundamental and durable will take some time to answer. Although prices for some commodities have risen, underlying consumer price inflation only now looks to be stabilizing at a low level after falling for some time. In the remainder of my time with you today, I will first sketch more fully some of the recent developments in the economy and what I believe to be the most likely path forward. Then I will discuss two uncertainties regarding that outlook that have garnered attention lately--namely the possibility that the labor market will continue to underperform and the possibility that financial stress in the household sector may cause the expansion to falter. As I will discuss in greater detail shortly, it seems to me that the evidence suggests that while neither risk can be ruled out, nor is either likely to come about. That said, of the two, the greater concern for me is the future performance of the labor market. As always, the views I will be expressing are my own and do not necessarily represent those of other members of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. Recent Economic Developments For the most part, the past year has been one of continued recovery in the U.S. economy. After averaging just 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the first half of last year, the pace of real GDP growth surged to more than 6 percent in the second half. For 2003 as a whole, the pace of growth was the fastest since 1999. As has been the case for some time, households in 2003 provided considerable impetus to the economy. Supported importantly by last summer's tax cuts, low interest rates, and rising household wealth, consumer spending continued to trend up, while low mortgage rates have kept both home sales and new housing starts close to record highs. In addition, the economic environment now seems more conducive to business investment. For much of the past three years, businesses were reluctant to invest in new capital equipment. At first, the downturn in investment seemed to be a reaction to what in hindsight appears to have been a substantial overinvestment in high-tech equipment in the late 1990s. As business investment subsequently lagged the improvement in household spending, however, a marked degree of caution seemed to settle on the business community. This caution--which appears to have had its roots in the uncertainty associated with terrorism, geopolitical risks, and a wave of corporate governance scandals--induced firms to focus on restructuring rather than expanding their operations, and it left them quite hesitant to increase their investment outlays. By the middle of last year, however, firms were beginning to boost their capital spending. And, in the second half, real fixed investment rose more than 10 percent at an annual rate, the fastest two-quarter rate of increase since early 2000. To be sure, a sizable portion of the recent strength in investment has been for high-tech equipment, and much of it probably reflects replacement of outdated machines rather than an expansion of existing production capacity. However, spending on other types of equipment now seems to be picking up as well, and the caution that had previously restrained capital spending seems to be in the process of lifting. Against this backdrop, inflation has remained quite low despite some sizable increases in energy prices. Overall, the consumer price index increased 1.7 percent over the twelve months ending in February, while the core index--which excludes the volatile food and energy components--increased only a little more than 1 percent. Outlook and Labor Market Uncertainties The consensus in the forecasting community is that GDP growth will not continue at the 6 percent pace posted in the second half of last year. But, with interest rates still quite low and fiscal policy generally stimulative, most forecasters are projecting relatively robust gains in output for the coming year, with ongoing increases in both household and business spending. Continued strong economic expansion seems to me, as well, to be the most likely outcome. Nonetheless, the economic outlook still bears some important uncertainties, two of which I would like to focus on today. The first relates to the labor market. As has been widely recognized, one notable shortcoming of the current expansion has been the dearth of job creation over the past two years. Last week's report that employers added 308,000 workers to their payrolls in March was encouraging and may signal that the recovery in the labor market is gaining traction. Even so, the level of private employment remains more than 500,000--or 1/2 percent--below that at the trough of the recession in November 2001. The weak performance of the labor market over this period has been quite unusual by the standards of past economic recoveries, and, indeed, it is even weaker than during the infamous "jobless recovery" of the early 1990s. For example, employment rose about 2 percent in the twenty-eight months following the 1990-91 recession. And, in the other seven post-World War II recoveries, employment growth averaged more than 8 percent over a period of comparable length. Economic forecasters' consensus is that, as the expansion matures, employment will continue to improve sufficiently to make noticeable gains in the utilization of labor resources. I judge that to be a reasonable assessment. Nonetheless, one cannot definitively rule out the possibility that hiring will fall short of expectations over the next several months as it had up until the most recent report. In particular, the lackluster performance we have seen in the labor market, even as real GDP has been moving up strongly, raises the question of whether an unusually large portion of the job cuts implemented by firms in recent years represent permanent layoffs that will only gradually be offset by job creation elsewhere in the economy. A number of hypotheses have been put forth as potential causes of the generally disappointing performance of the labor market, and, indeed, it seems likely that several factors have contributed to the shortfall in hiring. But any meaningful explanation must account for the surprising strength in productivity growth in recent years. In particular, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose 4-1/4 percent in 2002 and nearly 5-1/2 percent in 2003, the largest back-to-back increases since the early 1960s. Let me review the major hypotheses advanced to explain labor market developments. One possibility is that the same factors that induced businesses to take an unusually cautious approach to capital spending also influenced their willingness to add new workers. If so, then some of the surprising weakness in employment growth and some of the strength in productivity may have reflected a tendency by employers to stretch their existing work forces beyond a level that is sustainable in the longer run. The sizable increase over the past year in employment at temporary help agencies--another potential margin of adjustment for firms unwilling to take on permanent employees--is consistent with this view. And, further supporting this hypothesis, one hears reports of longer hours worked by many white-collar and nonproduction workers. If this hypothesis is correct, then the recent strength in business investment bodes well for an upturn in the labor market if the pickup in capital spending is an indication that businesses have become more optimistic about the future course of the economy. Indeed, according to this hypothesis, the improvement in hiring could be rapid as businesses respond not only to further increases in output but also hire to alleviate the growing strains on their more experienced workers. The chief argument against this story is that the combination of a weak labor market and strong productivity growth has been ongoing for quite some time. And it certainly seems possible that a portion of the extraordinary productivity growth of recent years represents a permanent increase in efficiency. According to proponents of this view, some of these productivity improvements may have resulted from firms' focusing on restructuring and cost-cutting in ways that provide ongoing efficiencies. They may have been able to do so, in part, because they have realized a delayed efficiency payoff to the substantial investments in high-tech equipment in the late 1990s. Regardless of its source, however, the possibility that some of the productivity improvement--and some of the job cuts--of recent years are permanent suggests that the weak labor market may, in part, be associated with an increase in the economy's potential output. This possibility implies that a given rate of increase in GDP may be consistent with a more gradual pickup in hiring than in the preceding scenario. Finally, a couple of other influences probably damped hiring somewhat but seem unlikely to have been major factors. For example, the recent sizable increases in health insurance costs and in pension costs are cited by some as a reason for businesses to avoid hiring new employees. In the aggregate, however, health insurance costs represent only about 6 percent of overall compensation costs, and many firms seem to have responded to these higher costs by reducing increases in either wages or other parts of the benefits package. Similarly, although a number of corporations have had to make sizable contributions to underfunded defined-benefit pension plans, the shrinking share of workers covered by these plans suggests that such contributions probably have not had a material affect on hiring decisions. Moreover, during the second half of the 1990s, when pension plans were overfunded and, in many cases, improving the bottom lines of firms, one rarely, if ever, heard anecdotes suggesting that low pension-funding costs were boosting employment. Other observers have pointed to the outsourcing of production abroad as a reason for the weakness in the labor market. Again, however, the magnitude of this phenomenon seems too small to explain more than a small part of the decline in employment over the past two years. Private-sector estimates of outsourcing are on the order of 1 percent of the gross job losses that occur each year. Moreover, because outsourcing abroad represents a shift of both production and labor input to a foreign country, outsourcing is probably not a major explanation for our recent history of elevated productivity growth. What does all of this imply for economic policy? In the short-term, the weakness in the labor market reflects a shortfall of aggregate demand relative to the economy's potential, which is an important part of the rationale for the currently accommodative stance of monetary policy. The real federal funds rate is now close to zero, and market participants expect it to remain near that level for a while. Obviously, we monetary policy makers will have to determine the degree to which the improvements in the labor market signaled in the most recent report indicate that the economy is meaningfully closing the gap between aggregate demand and the economy's productive capability, and the pace with which that gap is being narrowed. As I said earlier, it will take some time to make that determination. But we also have to recognize that maintaining the current level of the funds rate for too long will eventually result in an unwelcome increase in inflationary pressures. In the longer run, it is important that we as a society recognize the considerable economic benefits associated with sustainable increases in productivity and intensify our efforts to ensure that as many individuals as possible profit from the substantial productivity gains associated with innovation and increased competition. Unless we do so, the support of the population for flexible markets, technological change, and free and open trade--so crucial to the ongoing improvement of our standard of living--will erode further. In my view, the best long-run response to the inevitable turbulence of a dynamic market economy is to increase our investment in the education and skills of the workforce. An improvement of this type would pay handsome dividends in many respects--allowing not only workers who retain their jobs to be more productive and earn higher wages but also allowing those who lose their jobs to gain reemployment in more stable jobs with less loss in earning power. With experienced workers, society's challenge is to provide opportunities for those adversely affected by economic change to build on their previous work experience and to retool their skills to meet the changing requirements of the economy. An important source of such opportunity has been our community colleges, which have experienced sizable increases in enrollments since the early 1970s, particularly among adults. In addition, many four-year public colleges and universities now offer programs specifically tailored to the schedules of adults, many of whom are attempting to balance part-time schooling with family and work responsibilities. For our future workforce, we must ensure that our educational system is adequately equipping students with the greater skills demanded by employers operating in an increasingly complex economy. I do not have the answers to these educational challenges. But I do know how important it is that we address them. And given our successes in the past, I am confident that we can. Financial Health of Households Let me now turn to a second important uncertainty in the outlook--namely, the financial health of U.S. households. As I mentioned earlier, a key element in the current cyclical expansion has been robust spending for consumption and housing. An oft-expressed concern has been that many households have become overextended, will eventually have to cut back on spending, and in doing so may short-circuit the expansion. It is easy to see the basis for this concern. First, consider the rise in household debt. Relative to disposable income, debt has been hitting record highs annually since 1993. Indeed, with house prices rising rapidly and interest rates at historically low levels, mortgage borrowing surged 12-1/2 percent in each of the past two years, twice the rate of growth of disposable income. Meanwhile, the personal bankruptcy rate, although relatively stable in recent quarters, is still near its record high. Despite these ominous sounding numbers, and while remaining alert to the possibility of more acute financial distress, I believe that, in the aggregate, households fundamentally are in good financial shape. Even with the heavy borrowing they have undertaken, households have kept their debt-payment burdens in check. At the aggregate level, one can evaluate debt burdens in two ways. One measure is the debt service ratio. The numerator of this ratio is the minimum payment required on mortgage and consumer debt--for example, car loans, student loans, and credit card debt--and the denominator is after-tax income. The debt service ratio captures such things as the effects of changes in interest rates, loan maturities, and loan demand on the debt obligations of households. A somewhat broader measure--and one that the Federal Reserve has only recently introduced--is the financial obligations ratio. This measure adds required payments on rent, auto leases, homeowners' insurance, and property taxes to debt service. This broader measure recognizes that both homeowners and renters have fixed financial obligations, and it recognizes that there is no essential difference between payments for an auto loan and those for an auto lease. Moreover, unlike the simple ratio of debt to income, both the debt service ratio and the financial obligations ratio have receded slightly, on net, from their respective peaks. Similarly, delinquency rates for a wide range of household loans turned down over the second half of 2003. Those who are most concerned about the macroeconomic consequences of household debt argue that although these measures of financial stress have stopped getting worse, they still are at very high levels by historical standards; the risk, they argue, is that the household sector could be quite vulnerable to an adverse shock. This is a legitimate argument, but other factors limit my concern about this possibility. First, most debt is held by households that also have substantial assets. Indeed, according to the , 96 percent of total debt is owned by households with positive net worth--that is, assets greater than their liabilities. Moreover, looking at the question from the perspective of the number of households, fully 90 percent of all households in 2001 had assets greater than their liabilities. Even if one disaggregates these numbers further and focuses on the amount of debt held by lower-income households or by households particularly vulnerable to an adverse shock, the numbers are relatively small. For example, households in the lowest fifth of the income distribution hold only 3 percent of all household debt. Widening the scope to the entire lower half of the income distribution, these households have only about 20 percent of outstanding debt. In other words, 80 percent of debt is held by households in the upper half of the income distribution, and these are households that also hold substantial assets. Reflecting these debt patterns, the bulk of the available statistical evidence suggests that adverse movements in broad indicators of household financial health do not have much incremental predictive power for overall consumer spending. In essence, the research says that--after taking account of current and expected income, wealth, and interest rates--debt burdens, delinquency rates, and the like do not provide significant additional value in explaining movements in consumer spending. Some commentators have argued that the real fragility in the system will be exposed when interest rates return to more-normal levels. According to this argument, higher rates will boost required monthly payments, which in turn will lead to a jump in loan defaults, severe strains on financial institutions, and a sharp cutback in household spending. It is important to recognize, however, that an increase in short-term interest rates does not automatically increase household debt payments across the board. A rise in rates will indeed increase borrowing costs on new credit extensions. However, most outstanding debt will not be affected by changes in the federal funds rate because the majority of mortgages carry a fixed rate, as do the bulk of other loans to consumers. Moreover, as short-term rates rise, households will take out smaller loans or take out loans with longer maturities. And households will trim their borrowing, preferring in some instances to pay for purchases with cash instead of credit. The empirical evidence suggests that, in the face of rising interest rates, households curb their use of debt enough to almost entirely offset the higher average cost of debt, leaving debt burdens little changed. Another factor that tempers my concern is that interest rates will rise from their current low level only when the economic expansion is on more solid footing. Thus, while households very likely will, at some point in the future, face a higher cost of credit on new borrowing, they will also be undertaking that new borrowing against a backdrop of greater job security and continued strong growth of incomes. That said, if the increase in rates crimps spending more than anticipated, I can assure you that we will move once again, as we have done consistently throughout this cyclical episode, to provide appropriate support to the economic expansion. Clearly some households have become burdened with excessive debt and may face considerable financial stress should their income become disrupted. Indeed, in order to help households like these acquire the information they need to make good financial decisions for themselves and their families, the Federal Reserve System in 2003 initiated a national campaign to raise the visibility and highlight the importance of financial education. But financially overextended households represent a small fraction of the total economy, and at the macroeconomic level, financial distress in the household sector seems unlikely to cut off the expansion. Conclusion Overall, the macroeconomic outlook for the United States is favorable. Over the past year, the economy has made considerable progress: Aggregate income is growing rapidly, business investment has begun to recover, the stock market has rebounded, and interest rates and inflation remain very low. To be sure, there are uncertainties regarding the outlook. While my concern about the labor market is somewhat alleviated by the most recent data, it remains at the top of my list. Another important uncertainty is the possibility that an adverse shock will expose an underlying weakness in the financial condition of households. But, I believe the economy most likely will steer clear of substantial damage from this source.

Joint Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Justice Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Housing Finance Board Federal Trade Commission National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight Office of Thrift Supervision For immediate release April 13, 2004 Federal Agencies Publish Spanish-Language Version of Consumer Brochure on Predatory Lending The federal Interagency Task Force on Fair Lending has published a Spanish-language version of a brochure that alerts consumers to potential borrowing pitfalls, including high-cost home loans, and provides tips for getting the best financing deal possible. The brochure, ( ) , warns that regardless of whether a home equity loan is for a home repair, bill consolidation or some other purpose, it's important to shop around. Borrowing from an unscrupulous lender, especially one that offers a high-cost loan using the home as security, could result in the loss of the borrower's home and money. The brochure cautions that certain lenders--often called "predatory lenders"--target homeowners, including the elderly, with low incomes or credit problems by deceiving them about loan terms or giving them loans they cannot afford to repay. Before signing the credit contract, consumers are encouraged to Think about their financing options Do their homework Think twice before they sign a loan contract Know that they have rights under the law The brochure notes that many consumers may have other options for meeting their financial needs, including housing counseling and social service programs. If consumers decide that a loan is right for them, the brochure suggests talking with several lenders; comparison shopping for interest rates, payments, term of the loan, points and fees, and other costs of the loan; and having a knowledgeable friend, attorney, or housing counselor review the loan documents. A shopping checklist is included with the brochure. The publication also reminds consumers that if they are refinancing or using their home as security for a home equity loan (or for a second mortgage loan or a line of credit), federal law gives them three business days after signing the loan papers to cancel the deal. The cancellation must be submitted in writing, after which the lender is required to return any money the consumer has paid to date. If the three-day period has already passed and consumers believe they have been misled, the brochure suggests that they contact a state or local bar association, a local consumer protection agency, or a local fair housing or housing counseling agency.

Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke Before The Investment Analysts Society of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois April 15, 2004 What Policymakers Can Learn from Asset Prices Central bankers naturally pay close attention to interest rates and asset prices, in large part because these variables are the principal conduits through which monetary policy affects real activity and inflation. But policymakers watch financial markets carefully for another reason, which is that asset prices and yields are potentially valuable sources of timely information about economic and financial conditions. Because the future returns on most financial assets depend sensitively on economic conditions, asset prices--if determined in sufficiently liquid markets--should embody a great deal of investors' collective information and beliefs about the future course of the economy. I thought you might find it interesting to hear a bit about how the staff of the Federal Reserve uses financial-market information to try to improve forecasts and help guide policy decisions. As you will see, asset prices provide information, particularly about market expectations, that is difficult to obtain elsewhere. However, a recurring theme of my remarks will be that extracting accurate information from asset prices and yields is more difficult and requires greater sophistication than is commonly supposed. Ongoing research in financial economics thus has great potential to provide practical assistance to monetary policy makers. As usual, the views I will express today are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. Market Expectations of Inflation: The Information in Inflation-Indexed Securities I will begin by discussing what financial markets can tell us about inflation expectations. The inflation expectations of financial-market participants are of particular interest to central bankers, for several reasons. First, as price stability is a key objective of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve puts substantial resources into forecasting inflation. To the extent that financial markets serve to aggregate private-sector information about the likely future course of inflation, data on asset prices and yields might be used to validate and perhaps improve the Fed's forecasts. Second, inflation expectations are of interest to policymakers independent of inflation itself. A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or "anchor," inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003). Finally, knowledge of the expectations of inflation in financial markets permits the calculation of real interest rates, which are important indicators of both the condition of the economy and the stance of monetary policy. Although clues about inflation expectations abound in financial markets, inflation-indexed securities would appear to be the most direct source of information about inflation expectations and real interest rates. Government securities whose realized yields depend on inflation, known on the Street as "linkers," have become increasingly common in industrial countries, Japan being the latest nation to introduce an inflation-indexed government bond. The U.S. Treasury began issuing TIIS (for Treasury inflation-indexed securities), more popularly known as TIPS (for Treasury inflation-protected securities), in January 1997. TIPS promise a yield-to-maturity that is guaranteed in real terms. To provide the promised real yield, TIPS coupon and principal payments are escalated based on increases in the consumer price index from the time at which the security was issued. The difference between the real yield guaranteed by an inflation-linked security and the nominal yield provided by a conventional security of the same maturity is known as the breakeven inflation rate or, alternatively, as inflation compensation. The top panel of shows the yield on nominal ten-year Treasury bonds (top line) and the real yield on ten-year TIPS since 1999 (bottom line). The vertical distance between the two lines is known as breakeven inflation at the ten-year horizon. The bottom panel uses overlapping issues of nominal securities and TIPS to disaggregate breakeven inflation into the rate that applies to bonds maturing five years from now and the implied forward breakeven rate from five to ten years out. The breakeven rate of inflation is often treated as a direct reading of investors' expectations of inflation. Under this interpretation, the lower line in the bottom panel of is an estimate of market inflation expectations over the next five years, and the upper line represents five-year forward expectations of inflation, that is, today's expectation of what average inflation will be between 2009 and 2014. Unfortunately, as a measure of market participants' expected inflation, breakeven inflation has a number of problems (Sack, 2000; Shen and Corning, 2001). First, and probably the most important, breakeven inflation includes a return to investors for bearing inflation risk, implying that the breakeven rate likely overstates the market's expected rate of inflation. Estimates of the inflation risk premium for bonds maturing during the next five to ten years are surprisingly large, generally in a range between 35 and 100 basis points, depending on the time period studied (Ang and Bekaert, 2003; Goto and Torous, 2003; Buraschi and Jiltsov, 2004). If the inflation risk premium averages 50 basis points, for example, then breakeven inflation will overstate the market's true expectation of inflation by half a percentage point, a substantial amount. A further complication is that inflation risk premiums are not constant but instead appear to vary over time as economic circumstances change. Second, although the issuance of inflation-protected securities has risen significantly, the outstanding quantities of these securities remain much smaller than those of conventional Treasury securities. Moreover, TIPS are attractive to buy-and-hold investors, in contrast to nominal Treasury securities, which are extensively used for trading and hedging (Sack and Elsasser, 2004). For both reasons, the market for TIPS remains significantly less liquid than those for most Treasury securities. All else equal, the likely presence of a liquidity premium in the TIPS return tends to make breakeven inflation an underestimate of expected inflation, thus offsetting to some degree the effect of the inflation risk premium. Like inflation risk premiums, liquidity premiums on TIPS appear to vary over time, further complicating the interpretation of breakeven inflation. A third issue is that the real values of the coupon payments on an indexed security are fixed by construction, while the real coupons of a nominal bond usually decline over its life. Hence, an indexed security typically has a longer duration with respect to real interest rate changes than does the nominal security, a difference that affects the relative riskiness of real and nominal securities. More generally, because TIPS returns are imperfectly correlated with the yields on both nominal Treasuries and stocks, some investors demand TIPS for general diversification purposes--a demand that appears to have increased significantly as investors have become more familiar with this new type of asset. As the supply of TIPS has been fairly limited, the rise in demand by institutional investors and others may push down the equilibrium real return on TIPS and thus raise measures of breakeven inflation. A separate issue that bears on the relevance of breakeven inflation for policymaking is that TIPS returns depend on the overall consumer price index (CPI), whereas for many purposes policymakers are more interested in the behavior of core inflation, a measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy prices. In fact, TIPS returns appear sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. As you can see in , breakeven inflation rates have proven surprisingly volatile over their short history. For example, when nominal Treasury yields swung sharply during the spring and summer of 2003, ten-year breakeven inflation moved sharply as well, declining about 40 basis points as the bond market rallied, then rising about 80 basis points when nominal yields came back up (top panel). This effect was seen also in inflation compensation at the five-to-ten-year horizon (bottom panel), a rather counterintuitive result. What should we make of the volatility of breakeven inflation over recent years? One interpretation is that inflation expectations are not as well anchored as policymakers would like (see Bernanke, 2004, for additional evidence on this point). The fact that inflation compensation tends to react strongly both to releases of macroeconomic data and to unexpected changes in monetary policy (Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson, 2003) supports this interpretation. Still, at this point I think we need to be cautious about drawing strong conclusions about the short-run behavior of expected inflation from the data on breakeven inflation. The fact that the volatility of breakeven inflation is so much greater than that of standard survey measures of inflation expectations (such as those collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for professional forecasters or by the University of Michigan for consumers) should give us pause. The responsiveness of breakeven inflation to what might be construed primarily as liquidity disturbances, such as the Russian debt crisis and recent bouts of mortgage hedging activity that roiled Treasury markets, suggests that variable liquidity premiums, together with varying inflation risk premiums, contaminate breakeven inflation as a measure of expected inflation. I have emphasized some reasons to be cautious in interpreting breakeven inflation as expected inflation. Nevertheless, I expect that the usefulness of inflation-indexed securities as a tool for measuring expected inflation will increase over time. The liquidity of TIPS should continue to improve as the share of government debt issued in inflation-linked form continues to rise, particularly if the Treasury decides to expand the range of maturities of indexed bonds that it offers. Moreover, as I will discuss briefly later in the talk, our ability to model risk and liquidity premiums is improving, which will help us control for an important source of volatility in breakeven inflation. Finally, the universe of inflation-linked financial assets seems to be increasing, which will allow for fruitful comparisons and cross-checking. For example, futures on the CPI were recently introduced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Although these contracts are not yet widely traded, they may at some point provide useful measures of breakeven inflation out to the maturity of the shortest-term TIPS, thereby filling in an important portion of the term structure of breakeven inflation. Interest Rates and Spreads as Leading Indicators An alternative approach to extracting information from financial markets is to examine a range of asset prices and yields to determine whether they are useful as leading indicators of economic developments. Financial prices meet several key criteria for being useful leading indicators. As I already noted, asset prices and yields are inherently forward looking and thus may contain information about future economic conditions not evident in other series. Moreover, asset prices, unlike many data series, are available on a timely and continuous basis and are not revised. At least since the 1930s, when Wesley Mitchell and Arthur Burns (1938) published their pioneering work, economists have noted the usefulness of asset prices in forecasting economic activity--though perhaps we should keep in mind Paul Samuelson's wry observation that "the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions." Although many financial quantities have been used in forecasting (an index of stock prices is included in the official index of leading indicators), interest rates on various financial instruments have perhaps been most often cited for their value as leading indicators. For example, in a 1992 paper, Alan Blinder and I found evidence that the federal funds rate, the short-term interest rate used by the Federal Reserve as its policy instrument, has significant predictive power for a variety of measures of economic activity. Various yield spreads have also been found to be informative about the future course of the economy. In 1989, James Stock and Mark Watson proposed a new index of leading indicators based on seven variables with exceptionally good forecasting track records up to that date. Among these variables were the spread between the ten-year and one-year Treasury yields (the term spread), the yield differential between commercial paper and Treasury bills (the public-private spread), the change in the ten-year Treasury yields, and the nominal exchange rate. Thus, Stock and Watson found that two of the best seven macroeconomic forecasting variables were interest rate spreads, and four of the best seven forecasters were financial in nature. Of these variables, the term spread (also known as the slope of the yield curve) had been recognized for some time as a useful indicator of cyclical conditions. shows the historical behavior of the term spread (top panel, here measured as the ten-year rate less the three-month rate), as well as that of the federal funds rate and the spread between commercial paper and three-month T-bill yields for comparison. The shaded areas indicate periods of recession as designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research. It is interesting that the slope of the Treasury yield curve has turned negative (top panel), at least briefly, at between two and six quarters before every U.S. recession since 1964 (Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei, 2003). It has given only one false signal, in 1966, when an economic slowdown--but not an official recession--followed the inversion of the yield curve. The slope of the yield curve is potentially informative for several reasons. To some extent, it captures the stance of monetary policy. For example, when the yield curve is sharply upward sloping, as is the case today, one can usually conclude that monetary policy is in an expansionary mode (because the short-term policy rate lies below the average of expected future short-term rates). Either an expected pickup in economic growth or higher expected future inflation would also tend to raise long-term rates relative to short rates, steepening the yield curve. Evidence for the predictive power of the slope of the yield curve has been found for other industrialized countries as well as for the United States. Although the evident information content of the term spread and other yields and spreads is intriguing, these variables--like breakeven inflation--hardly provide a foolproof forecasting tool. For example, the Stock-Watson indicator and other indicators based on interest rates and spreads signaled the 1990-91 recession very weakly and rather late. The yield curve was inverted from June 2000 through March 2001, which presaged the 2001 recession, but other financial indicators (such as the public-private spread) missed the downturn entirely (Stock and Watson, 2003a), as you can see in . More generally, Stock and Watson (2003b) have recently documented that simple forecasting relationships are typically quite unstable, presumably because both the nation's economic structure, the conduct of policy, and the mix of shocks that buffet the economy change over time. Although the use of financial data as leading indicators is not without risks, I suspect that economists will continue to try to find better ways to extract the information in these data. I see two general approaches as being especially promising. First, forecasting relationships that simultaneously use information from a large number of data series may be more robust than prediction equations based on only a few variables (Stock and Watson, 2003b). One effective way to summarize the information in large data sets is through the estimation of statistical models that extract the common information conveyed by many variables. Currently, the U.S. Treasury uses a model of this type in preparing its forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP), and the Chicago Fed's national activity index, which draws on earlier work by Stock and Watson, is also based on these methods. The Board staff is currently investigating the potential of this approach for forecasting the economy. The other promising approach is to combine financial and macroeconomic information in a more structured way. For example, Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (2003) have used modern financial theory to construct a model of the Treasury yield curve that closely links the behavior of real GDP and a few key interest rates. In particular, their framework incorporates the possibility of two-way causality, allowing for both interest-rate effects on the economy and the impact of economic developments on interest rates. These authors show that combining financial and macroeconomic elements in a single model permits better forecasts of both GDP and of interest rates than can be achieved through less formal methods. Other work, for example by Ang and Bekaert (2003), shows how modeling the links between interest rates and the economy may help us obtain more efficient forecasts of inflation. These methods are also being studied at the Federal Reserve Board. One important advantage of this theory-based modeling approach is that it permits the estimation of risk premiums. For example, presumably the predictive power of the term spread would be enhanced if we could separate changes in the spread resulting from changes in rate expectations from those arising from changes in risk premiums. Similarly, better estimates of inflation risk premiums would prove useful for adjusting breakeven inflation rates from TIPS to get more reliable measures of expected inflation. Market Expectations of Monetary Policy What do markets expect about the future course of monetary policy? The question is important to policymakers, not because we are concerned necessarily that we should meet the market's expectations--such a strategy quickly degenerates into a hall of mirrors--but as a check on the efficacy of our communication. If the policy expectations of the market differ significantly from the policy expectations of central bankers, then the two leading possibilities are, first, that the policy committee has not accurately communicated its outlook and objectives or, second, that the market hears the policy committee's message but is skeptical of it. A number of financial instruments provide readings on the market's policy expectations. Two of the most useful are federal funds futures contracts and eurodollar futures contracts. These contracts are traded in highly liquid markets. Moreover, by their nature they are closely tied to expectations of monetary policy changes, as both reflect rates paid in the interbank market, the market that is targeted by the Federal Reserve's open-market operations. Implied forward values of short-term interest rates at various horizons can be extracted from federal funds and eurodollar futures contract prices in a straightforward way. provides an illustration. The lower, dashed line shows the path of the expected federal funds rate through 2008 as implied by federal funds and eurodollar futures at the close of the market on April 1, 2004, with an adjustment for the average level of term premiums. The upper, solid line shows the path of expected funds rates as of the market close on the next day, April 2. As you probably know, the payroll employment numbers announced on April 2 significantly exceeded market expectations. shows that the payroll data seems to have caused the market to price in an expectation of a higher federal funds rate target over the entire policy horizon. Of course, that change in policy expectations is consistent with the significant rise in Treasury yields that occurred after the employment report. Observing market expectations of policy provides useful feedback to the policymakers. Yet again, however, caution is needed in interpreting these data. As with inflation-indexed securities, forward interest rates implied by futures contracts do not necessarily correspond to market expectations of the short-term rate, because of the presence of premiums for interest-rate risk. Indeed, research suggests that risk premiums in federal funds and eurodollar futures contracts are not trivial and may vary over time. For example, a study by Piazzesi and Swanson (2004) has found that risk premiums on federal funds futures are both strongly countercyclical and predictable at longer horizons. The implication is that, although futures prices provide good estimates of market expectations of policy at short horizons of six months or so, at longer horizons they can be misleading. In particular, Piazzesi and Swanson (2004) find that if analysts ignore risk premiums in federal funds and eurodollar futures, they will estimate longer-horizon policy expectations that "lag behind" actual market expectations, remaining too high when the Fed is easing and too low when the Fed is tightening. Fortunately, this research also shows how to correct the futures data to account for the time variation in risk premiums. Once again, we see that some subtlety is required to extract the information available in asset prices. A great advantage of market-based measures of policy expectations, relative to periodic surveys that ask market participants about their expectations, is that market measures are available essentially continuously. These measures thus lend themselves to "event studies" of two types, both of which are employed at the Board of Governors. The first type analyzes how various events, such as Federal Reserve statements; the release of minutes, testimony, or speeches by members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC); and macroeconomic news affect market expectations of monetary policy. One simply compares the implied policy expectations before and after the event being studied. We have already considered an example, the effects of the most recent payroll report, in . Analyses of this type provide insights for policymakers into the question of what economic factors the "market," viewed collectively, is focusing on at a given time. The second type of event study uses market-based measures of policy expectations to analyze the effects of policy changes on the economy. In particular, when the FOMC chooses to set the target for the federal funds rate at a value different from that expected by the market, asset prices tend to react strongly. For example, in a recent paper, Kenneth Kuttner and I (2004) studied the effects on stock prices of unanticipated changes in monetary policy, as measured by settings of the federal funds rate target that differ from those implied by federal funds futures market. We found that a surprise increase of 25 basis points in the funds rate target typically results in a decline in broad equity indexes of about 1 percent, whereas a change in the funds rate that is expected by the market has essentially no effect on stock prices. Our work is just one example of a number of event-study analyses that may well shed light on the effects of monetary policy and the channels of monetary policy transmission. Policymakers are concerned not only about market expectations of output, inflation, interest rates, and other key variables, but also about the extent of market uncertainty about those and other variables. Financial data provide insight about market uncertainty that is obtainable nowhere else. For example, the Board's staff regularly analyzes the prices of options on eurodollar futures to estimate the degree of uncertainty that market participants have about monetary policy at different horizons. Indeed, by examining options with different strike prices, and under some reasonable additional assumptions, one can produce a full probability distribution of market expectations for the level of the federal funds rate at various dates in the future. Likewise, analysis of various types of options can generate distributions of expectations for economic and financial variables ranging from oil prices to the exchange value of the dollar to future stock prices. Conclusion Financial markets aggregate enormous amounts of information and thus provide a rich hunting ground for central bankers trying to learn about the economy. Today I have tried to provide a small taste of the many types of financial data that are analyzed by the staff at the Federal Reserve as well as to give you some sense of the techniques that they bring to bear. A message that I also hope to leave with you is that some of the potentially most valuable information in financial markets often requires considerable theoretical and empirical sophistication to extract. For this reason, and as I mentioned at the beginning, financial research of the type being conducted at the Board, in academia, and in the investment community will prove invaluable to the Federal Reserve in our efforts to support a stronger and more stable economy.

Footnotes Thanks are due to James Clouse and Brian Sack for superb assistance. Indeed, their potential usefulness in this respect was an explicit motivation for their introduction in the United States. As a partial fix of this problem, the breakeven inflation rates shown in Figure 1 are calculated by comparing the yields of TIPS and so-called off-the-run securities. Within a given class of securities, say Treasury bonds with ten years until maturity, off-the-run securities are securities other than those most recently issued. Because off-the-run securities are less liquid than newly issued (on-the-run) securities, they provide a more appropriate benchmark against which to compare the yields of relatively illiquid inflation-indexed bonds. As Sack (2000) has pointed out, this difference in duration implies that the breakeven inflation rate may be sensitive to the expected profile of future short real rates or be affected by differences in risk premiums arising from different exposure to interest-rate risk. Sack addressed the issue of differing durations of nominal securities and TIPS by comparing yields on TIPS to yields on artificial securities constructed to provide the same pattern of real payments as a TIPS security, thereby eliminating the differences in duration noted in the text. He found, however, that the duration mismatch is less important quantitatively than differences in liquidity between on-the-run nominal securities and TIPS. A number of technical issues, such as the lags in the inflation adjustment procedure, affect the relationship of breakeven inflation and expected inflation. One such potential complication arises if the tax rates applicable to the marginal TIPS investor and to the marginal holder of nominal government securities are not the same, in which case the equilibrium breakeven inflation level will be affected. Roll (2004) discusses the effects of taxation on the breakeven inflation rate. Indeed, Shen and Corning (2001) note that breakeven inflation is correlated with other measures of liquidity premiums, such as the spread between on-the-run and off-the-run securities. Perli and Sack (2003) discuss the volatility in Treasury bond markets associated with mortgage hedging activity. Stock and Watson (2003b) provide an exhaustive survey of the literature on the predictive power of asset prices for output and inflation. Parts of my discussion in this section draw from their paper. Friedman and Kuttner (1993) independently recognized the rather remarkable forecasting record of the public-private spread. For example, Estrella and Mishkin (1997) studied the predictive value of the term premium using data from France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Estrella and Mishkin found that the slope of the yield curve is useful for predicting growth at about a six-quarter horizon, with the link being somewhat stronger in the United States than in Europe. They also found that the slope of the yield curve helps to predict inflation (as measured by the GDP deflator), but at much longer horizons of about five years. Also using international data, Kozicki (1997) found that the term spread is a good short-run forecaster of output, but that the level of yields is a more useful predictor of inflation. In other work, Stock and Watson (1999) have shown that these so-called factor models can provide superior and more robust forecasts than methods based on only a few variables. Forni, Hallin, Lippi, and Reichlin (2000) and Bernanke and Boivin (2003) have obtained related results. Kozicki and Tinsley (2001), Hordahl, Tristani, and Vestin (2002), Ang and Piazzesi (2003), Craig and Haubrich (2003), Diebold, Rudebusch, and Aruoba (2003), and Rudebusch and Wu (2003) are among the many interesting papers in the recent "macro-finance" literature on the term structure. The volume of federal fund futures contracts traded has grown about sixfold in the past four years, to about 8.3 million contracts 2003. Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2002) examined the predictive power of federal funds and eurodollar futures contracts for settings of the federal funds rate target and found that in this respect they outperform other financial instruments. Specifically, they found that the federal funds futures contract dominates alternative instruments for forecasting the funds rate out to a horizon of several months, while eurodollar futures do slightly better than alternative instruments at longer horizons. Liquidity premiums are less of an issue for these markets. Sack (2004) also allows for time-varying risk premiums, making the assumption that the risk premium is related to the slope of the eurodollars futures curve at longer horizons. Like Piazzesi and Swanson (2004), he finds that time variation in the risk premium has little effect on estimated policy expectations at shorter horizons (six to twelve months, in his study) but becomes increasingly important at longer horizons. Another advantage is that, unlike survey participants, traders back up their forecasts with their money--a powerful incentive to make forecasts that are as accurate as possible. Our analysis used daily data. Using intraday data, Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2004) found an effect of similar magnitude. A caveat: These probability distributions are derived under an assumption of risk neutrality. Thus, unobserved risk premiums are potentially a problem here as well.
Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Capitalizing reputation At the 2004 Financial Markets Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Sea Island, Georgia (via satellite) April 16, 2004 Recent transgressions in financial markets have underscored the fact that one can hardly overstate the importance of reputation in a market economy. To be sure, a market economy requires a structure of formal rules--for example, a law of contracts, bankruptcy statutes, a code of shareholder rights. But rules cannot substitute for character. In virtually all transactions, whether with customers or with colleagues, we rely on the word of those with whom we do business. If we could not do so, goods and services could not be exchanged efficiently. The trillions of dollars of assets that are priced and traded daily in our financial markets before legal confirmation illustrate the critical role of trust. Even when followed to the letter, rules guide only a few of the day-to-day decisions required of business and financial managers. The rest are governed by whatever personal code of values that managers bring to the table. Market transactions are inhibited if we cannot trust the reliability of counterparties' information. The ability to rely on the word of a stranger is integral to any sophisticated economy. A reputation for honest dealings within a business or financial corporation is critical for effective corporate governance. Even more important is the way outsiders view the corporation itself. The reputation of a corporation is an exceptionally important market value that in principle is capitalized on a balance sheet as goodwill. Reputation and trust were valued assets in freewheeling nineteenth-century America. Throughout much of that century, laissez-faire reigned, and caveat emptor was the prevailing prescription for guarding against wide-open trading practices. A reputation for honest dealing was thus particularly valued. Even those inclined to be less than scrupulous in their private dealings had to adhere to a more ethical standard in their market transactions, or they risked being driven out of business. To be sure, the history of business is strewn with Fisks, Goulds, and numerous others treading on, or over, the edge of legality. But they were a distinct minority. If the situation had been otherwise, the United States at the end of the nineteenth century would never have been poised to displace Great Britain as the world's leading economy. Reputation was especially important to early U.S. bankers. It is not by chance that many bankers in the nineteenth century could effectively issue non-interest-bearing liabilities in the form of currency. They worked hard to develop and maintain a reputation that their word was their bond. For these institutions to succeed and prosper, people had to trust their promise to redeem banknotes in specie. The notion that "wildcat banking" was rampant before the Civil War is an exaggeration. Certainly, crooks existed in banking as in every business. Some banks that issued currency made redemption inconvenient, if not impossible. But these banks were fly-by-night operators and rarely endured beyond the first swindle. In fact, most bankers, especially on Wall Street, competed vigorously for reputation. Those who had a history of redeeming their banknotes in specie, at par, were able to issue substantial quantities, effectively financing their balance sheets with zero-interest debt. J.P. Morgan marshaled immense power on Wall Street in large part because of his widespread reputation for fulfilling his promises. Over the past half century, the American public has embraced the protections of the myriad federal agencies that have largely substituted government financial guarantees and implied certifications of integrity for business reputation. As a consequence, the market value of trust so prominent in the nineteenth century seemed unnecessary and by the 1990s appeared to have faded to a fraction of its earlier level. Presumably, we are better protected and, accordingly, better off as a consequence of these governmental protections. But corporate scandals of recent years have clearly shown that the plethora of laws of the past century have not eliminated the less-savory side of human behavior. We should not be surprised then to see a re-emergence of the market value placed on trust and personal reputation in business practice. After the revelations of corporate malfeasance, the market punished the stock prices of those corporations whose behaviors had cast doubt on the reliability of their reputations. Recent allegations on Wall Street of breaches of trust or even legality, if true, could begin to undermine the very basis on which the world's greatest financial markets thrive. Guilty parties should be expeditiously punished. Some practices and rules have outlived their usefulness and require updating. But in so doing we need to be careful not to undermine the paradigm that has so effectively governed voluntary trade. Rewriting rules that have served us well is fraught with the possibility for collateral damage. I hope and anticipate that trust and integrity again will be amply rewarded in the marketplace as they were in earlier generations. There is no better antidote for the business and financial transgressions of recent years.
Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and members of the committee, I am pleased to be here this morning to discuss the condition of the U.S. banking system and various related matters. They include improved risk-management practices of banks, the current status and direction of our regulatory efforts to revise capital standards for internationally active banks, deposit insurance, and the ongoing consolidation process within our domestic banking industry. Growth in the size and complexity of the largest U.S. and foreign banking organizations, in particular, has substantially affected financial markets and the supervisory and regulatory practices of the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies around the world. It has, in part, required authorities to focus more than before on the internal processes and controls of these institutions and on their ability to manage risk. Only through steady and continued progress in measuring and understanding risk will our banking institutions remain vibrant, healthy, and competitive in meeting the growing financial demands of the nation while keeping systemic risk at acceptable levels. Therefore, the regulatory authorities must provide the industry with proper incentives to invest in risk-management systems that are necessary to compete successfully in an increasingly competitive and efficient global market. When I last discussed the condition of the banking industry with this committee in June 2001, the industry's asset quality had begun to decline, but from a relatively high level, and banks were generally well positioned to deal with the emerging problems. Moreover, as early as the late 1990s, both the industry and bank supervisors had begun to address the slippage in credit standards that was one of the causes of the drop in asset quality. By most measures, this was an unusually early stage in the economic cycle to begin addressing such deterioration. Today, with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that the weaknesses I cited then have indeed been mild for the banking system as a whole and that the system remains strong and well positioned to meet customer needs for credit and other financial services. During the past two years, in particular, the industry extended its string of high and often record quarterly earnings. For the full year 2003, commercial banks reported net profits of more than $100 billion while maintaining historically high equity and risk-based capital ratios and enjoying brisk asset growth. Although the demand for business loans and the underwriting of equity securities have been weak over the past few years, banking organizations have continued to benefit from strong demand for household credit, not least for residential mortgage products as interest rates declined substantially. Moreover, the volume of problem assets in commercial banks declined each quarter last year, including a drop in the fourth quarter of nearly 10 percent, which brought the ratio of problem assets to total loans and foreclosed assets to less than 1 percent--its lowest level since year-end 2000. As a result of this favorable performance, both the size and the number of bank failures in recent years have been exceptionally small. Last year, for example, only two banks, with combined assets of just $1.5 billion, failed. The results of last year's interagency review of large syndicated loans and internal reports about the level and distribution of their criticized and classified credits lead us to expect still further improvement in the industry's asset quality this year. Notably, the pool of "special mention" credits that are weak but still performing (and which tend to produce the more serious problem assets) has shrunk both in the annual Shared National Credit review and in the quarterly bank reports. Risk measures derived from prices of publicly traded bank securities--stocks, debt securities, and credit default swaps--also signal that market participants are taking an increasingly positive view of the future of banks. Indeed, these measures suggest the lowest level of market concern about these companies that we have seen during the five-years in which we have tracked them. The banking industry's relatively benign experience with loan losses these past few years may not be surprising given that the recession was mild by most measures. The experience is more notable, however, when one considers the broader range of shocks and developments that have occurred during this period, including the September 11 attacks, Argentina's credit default, the continuing shift by large and not-so-large firms in this country from bank to capital market financing, and the concentration of recent economic pressures on specific industries and business sectors. These events tended to reduce the overall quality of corporate loan portfolios at banks and contributed significantly to banks' efforts to improve their measurement and management of risks, especially after the substantial credit losses they suffered in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These efforts, aided by the continued trend toward industry consolidation, helped moderate previous concentrations of credit exposures in bank portfolios and fueled greater use of new methods of hedging and managing risk. At present, credit risk-management practices are perhaps least developed in measuring risk associated with exposures related to construction projects and to the financing of commercial real estate, which have grown rapidly, particularly among regional and community banks. At all banks, such lending represented nearly 19 percent of all bank loans at year-end 2003--the highest level thus far recorded--and accounted for essentially all the loan growth last year at banks with less than $1 billion in assets. Despite the limited development of formal risk-management practices, credit standards applied to these loans have apparently been quite high. At least, we see as yet no signs of rising credit losses from such lending, and supervisory and market sources indicate that the poor lending practices of the late 1980s and early 1990s have been largely avoided. Nonetheless, the historical record provides ample evidence of the risks associated with this form of lending and of accumulating large credit concentrations in any form of exposure. Supervisors continue to monitor these concentrations and the lending practices and market conditions that will ultimately determine their effects on the banking system. These and other gradual changes in the balance sheets of banks, along with the sustained decline in market rates, helped compress net interest margins at many banks, as they chose not to reflect the full effect of lower market rates into rates paid on deposits without a specified maturity. As a percentage of earning assets, net interest income of all insured commercial banks declined 27 basis points last year, to 3.80 percent, the lowest level in more than a decade. Although this compression eased slightly during the fourth quarter, we cannot yet tell whether margins have begun to rebound. This compression of margins needs to be understood in the fuller context of the banks' sensitivity to changes in interest rates and, in particular, the effect of historically low rates on banks' financial performance and condition. At the same time that declining rates were adversely affecting the industry's interest margins, they were also spurring growth in mortgage-related assets and associated loan-origination fees and were producing significant capital gains in bank investment portfolios. Lower interest rates, along with the decline in equity valuations experienced during 2000-2002, also contributed to a substantial inflow of liquid deposits by lessening their opportunity cost. Under these circumstances, and with a steep yield curve, a banker's natural inclination might be to shift the credit mix and extend the maturity of assets in an attempt to bolster asset yields. To some extent such actions have been taken. Residential mortgage loans and pass-through securities have increased from 17.5 percent of assets in 2000 to 20 percent in 2003. But the manner in which this growth has occurred suggests a balanced assessment of risk. Call Report data indicate that a substantial portion of the increase in mortgage assets has been in adjustable-rate or shorter-term mortgages, particularly at smaller banks. For their part, large institutions also have significant capacity to offset on-balance-sheet exposures through off-balance-sheet transactions. All told, the available data, industry and supervisory judgments, and the long and successful experience of the U.S. commercial banking system in dealing with changing rates suggest that, in general, the industry is adequately managing its interest rate exposure. Many banks indicate that they now either are interest-rate neutral or are positioned to benefit from rising rates. These views are based partly on specific steps that they have taken to adjust portfolios and partly on judgments about the effects that rising interest rates would have in easing pressure on interest margins. That is, many banks seem to believe that as rates rise--presumably along with greater economic growth--they can increase lending rates more than they will need to increase rates paid on deposits. Certainly, there are always outliers, and some banks would undoubtedly be hurt by rising rates. However, the industry appears to have been sufficiently mindful of interest rate cycles and not to have exposed itself to undue risk. In other areas, earlier concerns about the effect of the century date change on computer systems, the destruction of infrastructure in the September 11 attacks, and the increased volume and scope of banking transactions generally have also required financial institutions, particularly large institutions, to devote more effort and resources to contingency planning in order to ensure the continuity of their operations. Last fall's power outage and Hurricane Isabel may have offered only limited tests of the industry's improved procedures, but financial firms handled those challenges extremely well. As the nation's central bank and as a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve has a strong interest in the continued operation of the U.S. financial system after a disruptive event. To that point, last year, the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency jointly issued an interagency paper, "Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System." That paper provides guidance that supplements long-standing principles of business continuity planning and disaster recovery and is directed at the entities that pose systemic risk to the financial system, particularly in the context of their clearing and settlement activities. Through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, we also issued revised examination guidance on business continuity planning. This guidance covers a variety of threats to business operations, including terrorism, and will be used in future examinations. Improved Risk Management in Banks Independent of continuity planning for unusual events, the basic thrust of recent efforts to improve the management of risk has been better quantification and the creation of a formal and more-disciplined process for recognizing, pricing, and managing risk of all types. In the area of credit risk, by providing those involved with a stronger, more-informed basis for making judgments, this development has enhanced the interaction between lending and risk-control officers. Operating with better information does not mean that banks will necessarily reduce credit availability for riskier borrowers. It does mean that banks can more knowingly choose their risk profiles and price risk accordingly. Better, more-informed lending practices should also lead to a more-efficient allocation of scarce financial capital to the benefit of the economy at large. Greater internal transparency and quantification of risk have helped bank managers monitor portfolio performance and identify aspects of the risk-measurement and credit-granting process that begin to move off track. As risk-measurement and disclosure practices evolve, investors and uninsured creditors will also become more motivated and better positioned to understand the risk profile of banks and convey their own views of banking risks. Indeed, accommodating greater and more-informed market discipline is an important goal of bank supervisors. Perhaps most important, better risk management has already begun to show real potential for reducing the wide swings in bank credit availability that historically have been associated with the economic cycle. Sound procedures for risk quantification generally lead to tighter controls and assigned responsibilities and to less unintended acceptance of risk during both the strengthening and weakening phases of the business cycle. Earlier detection of deviations from expectations leads to earlier corrective actions by bank managers and, as necessary, by bank supervisors. Better methods for measuring credit risk have also spurred growth in secondary markets for weak or problem assets, which have provided banks with a firmer, sounder basis for valuing these credits and an outlet for selling them and limiting future loss. Insurance companies, hedge funds, and other investors acquire these assets at discounts that they judge are sufficient to meet their expected returns and balance their portfolio risks. The result is greater liquidity for this segment of bank loan portfolios and the earlier removal of weakening credits from bank balance sheets. Portfolio risks have also been increasingly hedged by transactions that do not require asset sales, such as derivatives that transfer credit risk. With greater use, more-thorough review, and more-extensive historical data, risk modeling has improved in accuracy and will continue to do so. Supervisors are also learning these techniques and are pressing banks to improve their own methods and systems to keep up with the latest developments. In the United States, our leading banking organizations began the process years ago and, in many respects, were in the vanguard of the effort worldwide. Nevertheless, they and the risk-measurement process itself have much further to go. Recent initiatives of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to revise international capital standards have helped focus attention on risk-measurement practices and have encouraged further investment in this area. Moreover, the very improvements in technology that facilitated better bank risk measurement and management have undermined the current regulatory capital regime by creating transactions and instruments that were not conceived when the current regulatory standard was developed. Although these developments have sometimes helped banks circumvent existing rules, they have also enabled banks to hedge portfolio risk in ways that the current accord does not address well. As a result, the current regulatory capital standard is increasingly unable to establish capital requirements for our largest and most-complex banking organizations that reflect their true underlying risks. We need a more accurate, more risk-sensitive measure of capital adequacy to provide these institutions with appropriate risk-management incentives and to provide ourselves with a more reliable basis for supervising them in a way that focuses on true risks. In the process, such a measure should also enhance our efforts in taking prompt corrective action. For all these reasons, I believe the U.S. banking agencies must remain committed to the process of developing and applying a revised regulatory capital standard for the world's international banks. Proposed Capital Standards Last summer, the U.S. banking agencies took another step toward adopting the new capital standard by issuing for public comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR). The conception and design of the proposed standard, referred to as Basel II, are based on techniques developed in recent years by the largest banks, especially those, as I noted, in this country. As the scale and complexity of their activities grew, the banks needed to find better and more efficient ways to understand, manage, and control their risk-taking activities; to promote and respond to the emergence of new markets, such as those for securitized assets; and to make greater use of available technology and financial theory in measuring and managing their risks. Before the agencies issued the ANPR, numerous changes in the proposed Basel II Accord had already been made in light of earlier comments. Reflecting the comments received on the ANPR, the Basel Committee agreed to extend the period for reaching an agreement in principle until mid-2004 to permit more time for revisions of the proposal to be formulated. Indeed, we have already negotiated some major changes in the international proposal to reflect U.S. public comments. These changes include the adoption of a framework based on unexpected loss and a revised set of rules on securitization. We have also modified the implementation process to ease the burden on banking organizations that operate across borders. These technical changes were high on the list of modifications suggested by commenters. The shift from a combined "expected" and "unexpected" loss framework to one that focuses on unexpected loss only is crucial to ensuring that the regulatory capital framework is consistent with standard internal banking practices, both here and abroad. That change will also simplify other parts of the proposal. The modification on securitization was imperative to permit U.S. banks to continue participating in important funding markets that they pioneered and to ensure a prudent risk-sensitive capital treatment for securitization exposures. Beyond these achievements, working groups in Basel are considering other U.S. proposals related to refining measures of expected loss, an issue that a number of commenters raised. The U.S. agencies are still trying to reach a consensus on a revised proposal for capital charges on retail credit to put before our colleagues in Basel. The Federal Reserve, for its part, will continue to make every effort to reach consensus on this issue that is both risk-sensitive and workable. I believe that all the federal banking agencies are committed to achieving a revised accord that reflects the realities of the twenty-first century; that meets our needs for a safe, sound, and competitive banking system; and that addresses the legitimate concerns of the industry. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has raised important issues about capital adequacy, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has expressed significant concerns about a capital structure that may inadvertently disrupt retail credit operations of banks. All the agencies are addressing these concerns by jointly developing proposals to bring to Basel. In working to reach full agreement among ourselves, and ultimately with our colleagues abroad, we all seek a solution that promotes sound banking practices and that we can adequately implement and enforce. I hope that in the days ahead the agencies can close the gap on credit cards within such an overarching framework. If we can do so, the Basel Committee should be able to reach agreement in principle on a new proposal around midyear, and the U.S. banking agencies expect to evaluate that proposal through another "quantitative impact study" that we plan to conduct at large U.S. banks this fall. Committee members are aware that this survey and public comments on a forthcoming Notice of Proposed Rulemaking may raise still further issues that will need to be addressed before we can implement Basel II in the United States. Of course, other countries have their own national and European Union-wide review processes to conclude, and those consultations too, may raise issues that will require additional attention. As this committee knows, the U.S. agencies have proposed that in this country the most-advanced version of Basel II is to be required only of the largest, most-complex banking organizations, although we anticipate that some of the other larger banks also will choose to adopt that version. Non-adopters in the United States will continue to operate under the current capital rules. The current regulatory capital regime, as I noted, has become less effective for the largest organizations while consolidation has sharply increased the scale and scope of their activities. In this country, the Basel II proposal focuses on them. The current rules remain appropriate and prudent for other banking organizations in the United States, and the agencies have decided that imposing the cost of new rules on these banking organizations does not pass a cost-benefit test. Nonetheless, change in the procedures for calculating regulatory capital for larger banks creates uncertainty among those entities to which the new rules would not apply. The comments we received on the ANPR and from the Congress last year indicate that some smaller banks are concerned that their competitive environment will change. More specifically, these fears include the possibility that Basel II will induce adopters, who are likely to have reductions in regulatory capital requirements, to redeploy their capital by acquiring non-adopters or to gain a competitive advantage, particularly in the markets for small business and residential mortgage loans. To judge the merits of these concerns, the Federal Reserve conducted two technical and empirical analyses of the underlying issues and made the papers available to the public last month; congressional staff members were also briefed. A third study will be completed shortly, and a fourth will commence soon. The first of these papers, dealing with mergers and acquisitions, found virtually no statistical support for the view that either the level of, or changes in, excess regulatory capital have played a role in past merger and acquisition decisions, which suggests that any future effect of Basel II on such decisions is also likely to be quite small. Moreover, reductions in regulatory capital requirements for adopters relative to the requirements for non-adopters are unlikely to lead to an acceleration in the pace of consolidation. The second study evaluated the likely effect of Basel II on the competition between adopters and non-adopters in the market for small- and medium-sized business loans. It estimated that the marginal cost of such loans at adopting banks would decline no more than about 16 basis points, on average, and is likely to decline by less than that in most cases. Importantly, the study also found that most small business loans made by community banks are sufficiently different from those made by either required or likely adopters of Basel II as to make any marginal cost differences virtually irrelevant. Moreover, being riskier, the small business loans made by most community banks are priced so much above the loans made by the large banks that the marginal cost benefit to adopters would not be a material competitive factor. The study did find, however, that the types of small- and medium-sized business loans made by adopters and other large banks are, indeed, similar and similarly priced, so that adopting institutions may have a competitive advantage in many cases over other large banks that choose not to adopt Basel II. I will return to the implication of this finding in a moment. A paper analyzing competitive effects in the residential mortgage market will be available later this spring, and once the U.S. agencies agree on a proposal regarding the treatment of credit cards, staff members can begin analyzing potential competitive effects of the proposal in that market, as well. All four papers will then be re-evaluated early next year when new data become available from the agencies' next quantitative impact study. If the evidence following these reviews and a public comment process suggests that implementation of bifurcated capital standards in this country may affect competition in certain markets, the proposals for Basel II may need to be reconsidered. We may need, for example, to modify the application of Basel II in the United States, where permissible under the Basel agreement; negotiate further changes in the international agreement itself; or change the way the current capital rules are applied to institutions that do not adopt the new standard. In short, if we have sufficient indications that implementation of a new capital standard will distort the balance of competition, we can and will apply policies to mitigate this effect consistent with the risk profile of individual institutions. We cannot, however, respond to an unsubstantiated and generalized fear of change. Such concerns should not halt the evolution of regulatory capital standards for the large, complex banking organizations that play such an important role in our banking system and in global financial markets. Bank Consolidation Legislation designed to deregulate U.S. banking markets, technology, and other factors have contributed to significant structural change in the banking industry and to a decline of nearly 40 percent in the number of banking organizations since the mid-1980s, when industry consolidation began. Consolidation activity has slowed sharply in the past five years, but a recent uptick in merger announcements, including a couple of very large transactions, may signal a return to a more rapid pace of bank merger activity. Since 1995, the ten largest U.S. banking organizations have increased their share of domestic banking assets from 29 percent to 46 percent at year-end 2003. Yet, over the past decade, roughly 90 percent of bank mergers have involved a target with less than $1 billion in assets, and three-quarters have involved an acquiree with assets of less than $250 million. This ongoing consolidation of the U.S. banking system has not, in my judgment, harmed the overall competitiveness of our banking and financial markets. Although they have facilitated consolidation, the reduced barriers to entry--such as were provided by the Riegle-Neal Act's relaxation of interstate banking laws--have provided net competitive benefits to U.S. consumers of financial services. Other economic forces, such as technological change and globalization, have stimulated competition among depository institutions and between depositories and nonbank providers of financial services. In addition to other credit-extending businesses, our system of depository institutions alone continues to be characterized by many thousands of commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions. Measures of concentration in local banking markets, both urban and rural, have actually declined modestly not just since 2000 but since the mid-1990s. Significantly, most households and small and medium-sized businesses obtain the vast majority of their banking services in such local markets. Deposit Insurance I would like to turn now to the issue of deposit insurance reform and to the need for some legislative change in this area. As the committee knows, most depository institutions have not paid any deposit insurance premiums since 1996, and in fact, some large institutions that have been chartered in the past eight years have never paid them at all. Under current conditions, not only is a government guarantee being provided free, but also depositories having similar or identical risks are exposed to potentially disparate treatment should one, but not the other, of the deposit insurance funds fall below its funding target. In that situation, the FDIC would be required to impose a charge on one set of depository institutions while continuing to provide free deposit insurance to those in the other fund. Because some depository institutions today have commingled BIF- and SAIF-insured deposits as a result of bank and thrift mergers, this disparate treatment could apply even to different deposit accounts within the same depository institution. At this time, the Congress has the opportunity to provide the FDIC with greater flexibility to charge risk-based premiums, possibly using market data (for example, rates on uninsured deposits) for the largest banks, to allow such premiums to increase or decrease in a gradual manner over a wider range of fund reserve ratios, and to treat all depositories with similar risk ratings equally and equitably. Such reforms should be implemented in a manner that does not unnecessarily create additional moral hazard and that strengthens, rather than erodes, market discipline. Higher coverage limits, for example, would exacerbate moral hazard problems without apparent and offsetting benefits. The current level of coverage seems adequate to meet the needs of an overwhelming majority of depositors. First, depositors have certain flexibility in distributing large balances among multiple accounts and depository institutions to obtain higher insurance coverage. Second, the Federal Reserve's latest survey of consumer finances indicates that at year-end 2001 less than 4 percent of U.S. depositor households had any uninsured deposits. Moreover, the median bank IRA/Keogh account balance was only $15,000, well below the existing insurance limit. Finally, community banks have shown themselves just as adept as the largest banks in attracting uninsured deposits when necessary to fund customer loan demand. Conclusion In closing, Mr. Chairman, let me reiterate that the past decade has been one in which the banking industry has recorded persistent record profits while providing an ever-wider range of products and services to much more diverse groups. The industry's experience during the past several years in dealing with clear weakness in key economic sectors demonstrates the importance of strong capital positions and sound risk-management practices. Bank supervisors worldwide are working to encourage further progress in these areas, through more-accurate and more-effective regulatory capital standards based on even better internal risk-management procedures.

Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am pleased to be here today to offer my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy. The economy appears to have emerged around the middle of last year from an extended stretch of subpar growth and entered a period of more vigorous expansion. After having risen at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent in the first half of last year, real GDP increased at an annual pace of more than 6 percent in the second half. Aided by tax cuts, low interest rates, and rising wealth, household spending continued to post sizable gains last year. In addition, an upturn in business investment, which followed several years of lackluster performance, and a sharp rise in exports contributed importantly to the acceleration in real GDP over 2003. Although real GDP is not likely to continue advancing at the same pace as in the second half of 2003, recent data indicate that growth of activity has remained robust thus far this year. Household spending has continued to move up, and residential home sales and construction remain at elevated levels. In addition, the improvement in business activity has become more widespread. In the industrial sector, nearly two-thirds of the industries that make up the index of industrial production have experienced an increase in output over the past three months. More broadly, indicators of business investment point to increases in spending for many types of capital equipment. And importantly, the latest employment figures suggest that businesses are becoming more willing to add to their workforces, with the result that the labor market now appears to be gradually improving after a protracted period of weakness. Looking forward, the prospects for sustaining solid economic growth in the period ahead are good. Monetary policy remains quite accommodative, with short-term real interest rates still close to zero. In addition, fiscal policy will likely continue to provide considerable impetus to domestic spending through the end of this year. Importantly, the caution among business executives that had previously led them to limit their capital expenditures appears to be giving way to a growing confidence in the durability of the expansion. That confidence has, no doubt, been bolstered by favorable borrowing conditions, ongoing improvements in efficiency, and rising profitability, which have put many firms on a more solid financial footing. Nevertheless, some of the strains that accompanied the difficult business environment of the past several years apparently still linger. Although businesses are replacing obsolescent equipment at an accelerated pace, many managers continue to exhibit an unusual reluctance to anticipate and prepare for future orders by adding to their capital stock. Despite a dramatic increase in cash flow, business fixed and inventory investment, taken together, have risen only moderately. Indeed, internal corporate funds exceeded investment over the course of last year for the first time since 1975. Similar cautious behavior has also been evident in the hiring decisions of U.S. firms, during the past several years. Rather than seeking profit opportunities in expanding markets, business managers hunkered down and focused on repairing severely depleted profitability predominately by cutting costs and restricting their hiring. Firms succeeded in that endeavor largely by taking advantage of the untapped potential for increased efficiencies that had built up during the rapid capital accumulation of the latter part of the 1990s. That process has not yet played out completely. Many firms seem to be continuing to find new ways to exploit the technological opportunities embodied in the substantial investments in high-tech equipment that they had made over the past decade. When aggregate demand accelerated in the second half of 2003, the pace of job cuts slowed. But because of the newfound improvements in the efficiency of their operations, firms were able to meet increasing demand without adding many new workers. As the opportunities to enhance efficiency from the capital investments of the late 1990s inevitably become scarcer, productivity growth will doubtless slow from its recent phenomenal pace. And, if demand continues to firm, companies will ultimately find that they have no choice but to increase their workforces if they are to address growing backlogs of orders. In such an environment, the pace of hiring should pick up on a more sustained basis, bringing with it larger persistent increases in net employment than those prevailing until recently. Still, the anxiety that many in our workforce feel will not subside quickly. In March of this year, about 85,000 jobless individuals per week exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits--more than double the 35,000 per week in September 2000. Moreover, the average duration of unemployment increased from twelve weeks in September 2000 to twenty weeks in March of this year. These developments have led to a notable rise in insecurity among workers. Most of the recent increases in productivity have been reflected in a sharp rise in the pretax profits of nonfinancial corporations from a very low 7 percent share of that sector's gross value added in the third quarter of 2001 to a high 12 percent share in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in real hourly compensation was quite modest over that period. The consequence was a marked fall in the ratio of employee compensation to gross nonfinancial corporate income to a very low level by the standards of the past three decades. If history is any guide, competitive pressures, at some point, will shift in favor of real hourly compensation at the expense of corporate profits. That shift, coupled with further gains in employment, should cause labor's share of income to begin to rise toward historical norms. Such a process need not add to inflation pressures. Although labor costs, which compose nearly two-thirds of consolidated costs, no longer seem to be falling at the pace that prevailed in the second half of last year, those costs have yet to post a decisive upturn. And even if they do, the current high level of profit margins suggests that firms may come under competitive pressure to absorb some acceleration of labor costs. Should such an acceleration of costs persist, however, higher price inflation would inevitably follow. The pace of economic expansion here and abroad is evidently contributing to some price pressures at earlier stages of the production process and in energy markets, and the decline in the dollar's exchange rate has fostered a modest firming of core import prices. More broadly, however, although the recent data suggest that the worrisome trend of disinflation presumably has come to an end, still-significant productivity growth and a sizable margin of underutilized resources, to date, have checked any sustained acceleration of the general price level and should continue to do so for a time. Moreover, the initial effect of a slowing of productivity growth is more likely to be an easing of profit margins than an acceleration of prices. As I have noted previously, the federal funds rate must rise at some point to prevent pressures on price inflation from eventually emerging. As yet, the protracted period of monetary accommodation has not fostered an environment in which broad-based inflation pressures appear to be building. But the Federal Reserve recognizes that sustained prosperity requires the maintenance of price stability and will act, as necessary, to ensure that outcome.
Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies At the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act Banker Outreach Meeting, Nashville, Tennessee April 22, 2004 The Economic Outlook and Financial Health of Bank Customers I am delighted to be back in Tennessee today and to have a chance to visit with some old friends. I also want to thank you for giving so much of your time to help us identify ways to reduce unnecessary and unduly burdensome regulatory requirements on financial institutions. There is a real need to continually review the cost-benefit nexus of regulations, especially with the fast pace of evolution in financial markets and institutions. Thus, my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System and I are strong supporters of the goals of today's meeting. It is a critical supplement to our own efforts, which include a review of our regulations every five years to revise or rescind out-of-date or unnecessary rules. I thought that after lunch you might find it interesting to shift to a discussion of the financial health of bank customers and the economy. In that spirit, I would like to briefly share with you my assessment of the economic outlook and then to discuss in more detail how the evolution of household and business balance sheets in recent years is affecting economic activity. You should understand, however, that I am expressing my own opinions, which are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board or on the Federal Open Market Committee. The Economic Outlook As you know, real GDP grew at an annual rate of 6.2 percent in the second half of 2003, and the economic fundamentals seem to be in place for another sizable advance this year. Indeed, the central tendency range of FOMC-member forecasts is 4-1/2 to 5 percent. Yet despite the recent strong pace of economic activity, the labor market has improved at an unusually slow pace by historical standards. The most recent data--indicating a jump in payrolls in March--was good news, and I am cautiously optimistic that job growth will pick up further over the remainder of this year. My business contacts tell me that companies have become more optimistic about economic prospects and that their plans do include increases in the size of their payrolls. The latest data on consumer prices suggest that the process of disinflation may have come to an end. In March 2004, the twelve-month change in the core CPI rose to 1.6 percent--essentially the same pace as in March 2003, and the core PCE price index change from twelve months earlier moved back above the 1 percent level in both February and March. Although the increased pace of economic activity has put some upward pressure on prices at earlier stages of processing and higher energy prices are being passed through to the prices of some products, strong productivity growth and slack in resource utilization have kept core retail price increases in check. Household Financial Conditions Some commentators have expressed concern about the rapid growth in household debt in recent years, fearing that households have become overextended and will need to rein in their spending to keep their debt burdens under control. My view, however, is considerably more sanguine. Although there are pockets of financial stress among households, the sector as a whole appears to be in good shape. As bankers, you are well aware that households have taken on quite a bit of debt over the past several years. According to the latest available data, total household debt grew at an annual rate of 10 percent between the end of 1999 and the fourth quarter of 2003; in comparison, after-tax household income increased at a rate of 5 percent. But looking below the aggregate data, we must understand that the rapid growth in household debt reflects largely a surge in mortgage borrowing, which has been fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates and strong growth in house prices. Indeed, many homeowners have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages, some having done so several times over the past couple of years. Survey data suggest that homeowners took out cash in more than one-half of these "refis," often to pay down loans with higher interest rates. On net, the resulting drop in the average interest rate on household borrowings, combined with the lengthening maturity of their total debt, has tempered the monthly payment obligations from the growing stock of homeowners' outstanding debt. The Federal Reserve publishes two series that quantify the burden of household obligations. The first series, the debt service ratio, measures the required payments on mortgage and consumer debt as a share of after-tax personal income. The second series, the financial obligations ratio, is a broader version of the debt service ratio that includes required household payments on rent, auto leases, homeowners' insurance, and property taxes. Both ratios rose during the 1990s, and both reached a peak in late 2001. Since then, however, they have receded slightly on net from their respective peaks, an indication that households, in the aggregate, have been keeping an eye on repayment burdens. Because the debt service ratio and the financial obligations ratio are calculated from aggregate data, they do not necessarily indicate whether the typical household is experiencing financial stress. Nonetheless, we have found that changes in either ratio help predict future changes in consumer loan delinquencies. Accordingly, the fact that these ratios have come off their recent peaks is a hopeful sign about household loan performance. Indeed, delinquency rates for a wide range of household loans turned down over the second half of 2003. Another often-cited indicator of household financial conditions is the personal bankruptcy rate. Movements in the bankruptcy rate, to be sure, partly reflect changes in the incidence of financial stress, but the rate has been trending up for more than two decades for a variety of other reasons. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 made bankruptcy a more attractive option for most households by increasing the amount of wealth that households could retain after bankruptcy. Other factors that have likely contributed to the upward trend are the decrease in the social stigma of filing for bankruptcy and the growing access to credit in the United States. As lenders have become more sophisticated in their ability to assess the riskiness of borrowers, they have extended loans to households that were previously denied credit. These households are more likely to default on their obligations than the typical borrower, but this increased risk is priced into loan terms. Although the bankruptcy rate remains elevated, it has edged down on balance in recent months, likely because of the pickup in economic growth in the United States since mid-2003. This relatively upbeat assessment of household credit quality seems to be shared by lenders and by investors in securities backed by consumer debt. According to the Federal Reserve's survey of senior loan officers, the number of banks tightening their standards on consumer loans has fallen over the past year. This behavior certainly does not point to much concern about household loan performance. Moreover, one gets an even more positive message from the credit spreads on securities backed by auto loans and credit card receivables. In recent months, the spreads between the yields on these securities and swap rates of comparable maturities have narrowed across the credit spectrum. Thus far, I have focused on the liability side of the household balance sheet, but there have been favorable developments on the asset side as well. Equity prices rallied strongly last year and have continued to rise this year, reversing a good chunk of the losses sustained over the previous three years. In addition, home prices appreciated sharply during each year from 1997 to 2003. The cumulative rise since the late 1990s has exceeded the growth in per capita income by a wide margin. All told, the ratio of household net worth to disposable income--a useful summary of the sector's financial position--recovered last year to stand at a level about equal to its average over the past decade. Before I turn to the business sector, let me address the frequently expressed concern that a bubble may have developed in house prices after several years of rapid increases. Some of the measured price rise results from improvements in the quality of houses. Houses are bigger and have more amenities than in the past, two characteristics that will lead to rising average house prices over time. But even after one controls for quality, increases in home prices have been outstripping general price inflation by a considerable margin in recent years. Once again, the low interest rates are probably an important factor. Houses, like other assets, generate an expected stream of future benefits. With low interest rates, these future benefits are discounted less heavily, which raises the asset's price today. Low interest rates also push up house prices by boosting the demand for housing. Of course, some of that increased demand is being met by the rapid pace of construction of new housing. But building houses takes time, and in the interim, higher demand will push up the price of existing houses. Although we can identify the key forces behind the rise in house prices in recent years, we cannot be sure that the increases are fully justified by the prevailing fundamentals. Still, we need to keep the recent increases in house prices in perspective: Although house prices have been outstripping broad measures of inflation--even after adjusting for quality improvements--their rise is nothing like the increase in stock market prices in the late 1990s. In fact, the speculative forces that can sometimes drive equity prices to extremes are less likely to emerge in housing prices. First, buying and selling houses is a lot more expensive and cumbersome than buying and selling equities, which makes taking a speculative position in houses much more difficult. Second, housing markets are much more local than equity markets, which are national, if not global, in scope. So if any speculative frenzy emerged, it would be much less likely to spread in the housing markets than in equity markets. Finally, financial institutions have a much more disciplined process regarding the housing and construction lending market than they did in past housing cycles. Lenders today are cautious about lending for speculative purposes, and appraised values undergo more scrutiny than in the past. The expansion of credit to higher risk households may also have driven banks to strengthen their underwriting procedures. That said, local housing markets can certainly become overvalued and then experience sharp price declines. House prices fell significantly in several parts of the country in the early 1990s. But because the transactions costs are much higher in the housing market than in the equity market and because the underlying demand for living space is much more predictable than are the prospects for any given firm, the large increases and decreases often observed in the stock market are less likely to occur in the market for houses. In addition, lenders are much more responsive to local economic conditions and generally become more cautious in loan underwriting when unsold homes or local unemployment increase. Financial Conditions of Businesses The change in the economy that caught my attention in the second half of 2003 was that the decline in business fixed investment had finally ceased. Capital spending by businesses posted a solid increase in the second half of last year, and orders and shipments for nondefense capital goods--key indicators of equipment spending--point to further sizable gains. Moreover, the tenor of anecdotes from the corporate sector has become comparatively upbeat, with corporate managers seeing stronger revenue growth and a much improved and more accommodative financing environment. Four factors have contributed to this improvement in financial conditions: low interest rates, a widespread restructuring of corporate liabilities during the past few years, a sharp rebound in corporate profitability from its trough in 2001, and a substantial narrowing in market risk premiums. In addition, the burden of underfunded pension plans, perhaps the most prominent negative financial factor that remains, has eased of late. I will discuss each factor in turn. First, firms are continuing to benefit from the accommodative stance of monetary policy. With the federal funds rate at 1 percent, short-term borrowing costs remain very low. For longer-term debt, the combination of low yields on benchmark Treasury securities and reduced risk spreads has kept borrowing costs attractive. Indeed, the yield on Moody's Baa corporate bond index is at its lowest sustained level since 1968. Second, in response to low long-term rates and to investors' concerns arising from some high-profile, unanticipated meltdowns, firms have greatly strengthened their balance sheets. Many firms have refinanced high-cost debt, which has reduced the average interest rate on the debt of nonfinancial corporations more than 1 percentage point since the end of 2000. Businesses also have substituted long-term debt for short-maturity debt to improve their balance sheet liquidity and to reduce the risk of rolling over funds. In addition, many firms--especially in the most troubled industries--have retired debt through equity offerings and asset sales, which limited the growth of nonfinancial corporate debt in 2002 and 2003 to the slowest pace since the early 1990s. Third, firms have significantly tightened their belts. Over the past two years, the drive to cut costs has generated rapid productivity gains. This greater efficiency boosted corporate profitability in 2002 and 2003 despite rather tepid revenue growth. Moreover, a pickup in revenue growth in the second half of last year helped companies leverage those productivity gains, producing a dramatic recovery in overall corporate profitability. Over 2003, economic profits before tax surged more than 18 percent, bringing profit margins to their highest levels in several years. Fourth, risk premiums fell substantially last year as corporate governance scandals receded and investor sentiment turned markedly more positive. The recovery in stock prices reflects this brighter view. Spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed appreciably--especially for the riskiest firms--and they now stand at the lowest levels in several years. This decline in spreads has been helped by the beneficial effect of the balance sheet improvements that I mentioned a moment ago. Indicators of corporate financial stress, such as bond rating downgrades and default rates, have returned to levels normally associated with economic expansion. Delinquency rates on business loans at commercial banks have also declined, and our surveys indicate that, on balance, banks have recently eased the terms and standards on such loans for both large and small firms. Another sign of improved sentiment is that money has been flowing into riskier securities. For example, net inflows to equity mutual funds have been strong for about a year, and high-yield bond funds, too, registered strong net inflows in 2003. Junk bond issuance has picked up notably, and the market for initial public equity offerings has also shown signs of recovery, while investors still appear to be more selective than during the boom in the late 1990s. These four points all suggest that financial conditions are capable of supporting a sustained, healthy pickup in economic growth. The much improved profitability can help finance expansion directly out of internal funds or indirectly by supporting firms' borrowing capacity. Furthermore, firms will be able to draw on their liquid assets that have accumulated over the past couple of years. And given the successful efforts to pare costs, firms are set to benefit from new investment in plant and equipment. Perhaps the biggest financial hurdle still facing many corporations is the burden of underfunding in their defined-benefit (DB) pension plans, but even here we have seen some improvement. Stock market losses during 2000 to 2002 had significantly eroded the value of pension assets, while sharply declining interest rates had raised the current value of plan liabilities. As a result, the majority of S&P 500 plans were underfunded at the end of 2002, with a net shortfall that exceeded $200 billion. Thus, many companies needed to make additional contributions, in some cases quite substantial, to their pension plans. In 2002, S&P 500 firms contributed $46 billion to their pension plans--three times more than in either of the previous two years--and total contributions are estimated to have been even higher in 2003. This drain on corporate sponsors' cash resources is likely to ease in the near term, but longer-term issues remain. DB pension asset values have benefited from robust returns in equity markets since early last year. And earlier this month the President signed legislation that allows firms to reduce plan contributions for two years by permitting them to use a corporate bond rate rather than a Treasury bond rate to calculate liabilities. But beyond the near-term, firms with DB pensions tend to be in maturing industries with aging workforces, for which the growth of liabilities are high and rising. This longer-term challenge will remain even if the current favorable market conditions are sustained. Conclusion In summary, recent indicators suggest that the pace of economic activity remains solid, while inflationary pressures continue to be subdued. In addition, the household and business sectors are, by and large, in good financial shape. Although uncertainties remain, I believe that the fundamentals are in place to generate sustainable economic growth.
Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For Immediate Release April 23, 2004 Agencies Issue Proposed Rule on Use of Medical Information for Credit Eligibility The federal bank, thrift and credit union regulatory agencies today issued for publication in the Federal Register a proposed rule under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) that would incorporate the statutory prohibition on obtaining or using medical information in connection with credit eligibility determinations and, as required by the statute, create certain exceptions to be applied in limited circumstances. Section 411 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act) amends the FCRA to provide that a creditor may not obtain or use medical information in connection with any determination of a consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit, except as permitted by regulations. The FACT Act requires the agencies to prescribe regulations that permit creditors to obtain and use medical information for eligibility purposes when necessary and appropriate to protect legitimate operational, transactional, risk, consumer, and other needs. The FACT Act further provides for the regulations creating these exceptions to be issued in final form within six months of the date of enactment of the FACT Act, or June 4, 2004. As required by section 411, the proposed regulations would grant exceptions to allow creditors to obtain or use medical information in those circumstances that the agencies believe are necessary and appropriate in connection with determinations of consumer eligibility for credit. Section 411 of the FACT Act also amends the FCRA to limit the ability of creditors and others to share medical-related information with affiliates, except as permitted by the statute, regulation, or order. The proposed rule would enumerate situations in which creditors would be permitted to share medical information among affiliates. The proposed rule is being issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Office of Thrift Supervision. The rules of each agency are substantively identical. Comment on the proposed rule is requested within thirty days after publication in the Federal Register. The Federal Register notice is attached. # # # Federal Reserve Susan Stawick 202-452-2955 FDIC David Barr 202-898-6992 NCUA Cherie Umbel 703-518-6330 OCC Dean DeBuck 202-874-5770 OTS Erin Hickman 202-906-6913 FDIC David Barr 202-898-6992
Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. At the European Institute Roundtable on Financial and Monetary Affairs, Washingotn, D.C. April 23, 2004 Global Imbalances I am pleased to participate in a discussion with such distinguished colleagues and to share my thoughts about some key issues confronting economic policy makers. As you are all well aware, the global economy is becoming ever more tightly knit, with national economies increasingly drawn together through trade and financial market transactions--all facilitated by continuing advances in telecommunications and related technologies. The economic slowdown that the U.S. economy entered in 2001 was shared by Europe, East Asia, and Latin America. Similarly, the revival in growth that our economy has enjoyed since the middle of last year has also shown up, to greater and lesser degrees, in other parts of the world. Although growth rates in different regions of the global economy are somewhat synchronous, such shared movements in output do not ensure that external deficits or surpluses will remain small. With the United States now running a current account deficit equal to about 5 percent of the gross domestic product, the rest of the world must run a correspondingly large net current account surplus. And when the U.S. deficit starts to decline, then trade flows abroad will adjust as well, reducing their overall surplus. Because of its size and persistence, as well as recent declines in the value of the dollar, the U.S. current account balance is receiving an extraordinary amount of attention at present. Observers routinely ask the following questions: Is the deficit unusually, or even abnormally, large? How long can it be sustained? How might a correction of the deficit affect the United States and its trading partners, including Europe? One must always be mindful of the possibility that the inevitable adjustment process related to global imbalances may be disorderly , but the tone of these questions is often more pessimistic than I think is warranted. Nevertheless, these questions are important, and I will devote the remainder of my remarks to addressing them. Is the U.S. current account deficit "abnormal"? The economics profession has no consensus model to tell us, for a given economy, what the appropriate level of the current account balance is. At best, economists can agree on some general principles. I will emphasize only two. First, current account imbalances allow countries to smooth consumption over time, for example, in response to the ups and downs of the world price of a major export. Second, current account imbalances--which represent the difference between domestic savings and domestic investment--allow savings to be allocated to those parts of the world where they can be invested most productively. On the basis of these considerations, some analysts have argued that industrial countries should run current account surpluses and invest their abundant savings in developing countries, which, being labor-rich and capital-poor, would offer higher rates of return. However, examples of high or persistent current account deficits abound among industrialized economies, including Canada (averaging 2.5 percent of GDP from 1975 through 1998), the United Kingdom (1.9 percent of GDP from 1984 through 2003), and Australia (4.1 percent of GDP from 1974 through 2003). Global investors have confidence that in countries such as these as well as in the United States they can safely seek the highest possible return for their funds. Some of the factors that lie behind such confidence are political stability, a legal system that effectively protects property rights and enforces commercial contracts, economic policies that promote and strengthen the role of markets, a financial system that efficiently channels resources to their most productive uses, and an educational system that produces highly skilled workers and supports rapid technological development. These elements are present in many mature economies, including those of the United States and Europe. Rates of return on investments in the United States have also been driven by the rapid diffusion of technological innovation. Labor productivity in the United States accelerated to a rate of about 3 percent in the period 1996-2003. Over the same period, smoothing through the recent cycle, the value of U.S. equities rose about 80 percent compared with 60 percent for European equities and a decline of 30 percent for Japanese. These developments attest to the expansion of favorable investment opportunities in the United States. Thus, it is neither surprising nor abnormal that, beginning in the mid-1990s, capital flows to the United States--primarily in the form of direct investment and equity inflows--began to pick up substantially, including, importantly, investment flows from Europe. These capital inflows exerted upward pressure on the dollar and provided the financing for our widening current account deficit. How long can the current account deficit be sustained? To say that a current account deficit is unsurprising or explainable is not to say that it is sustainable in the long run. With the net external debt of the United States rising more rapidly than GDP, some narrowing of the deficit is inevitable. However, such shrinkage does not mean that the current account deficit will be eliminated. Moreover, to say that the current account deficit cannot stay large on a permanent basis is not to say just when or how adjustment will occur. One can envision several developments that could trigger adjustment, many of which would be very positive for the global economy. A pickup in perceived rates of return abroad could divert capital flows from the United States to other countries and prompt adjustments in external balances. In Europe, for example, a considerable expansion in the use of information technologies in recent years has not, to date, appreciably boosted growth rates of labor productivity. It is conceivable that such high-tech investments may finally lead to higher productivity growth, further boosting investment spending, and weakening trade performance, as occurred in the United States in the 1990s. In Japan, corporate and financial sector restructuring appears to be making gains. In Latin America, improved policies and more flexible exchange rates may set the stage for renewed capital inflows. And in Asia, a revival of domestic demand could give the authorities confidence that, if they allow capital inflows to strengthen their currencies and narrow their current account surpluses, high rates of economic growth will be maintained. Even if rival sources of demand for global capital do not emerge, another factor that would induce adjustment of the current account, if it were to occur, would be a diminishing appetite for additional U.S. assets and, therefore, a reduced willingness to finance the deficit. One cannot know whether or at what point such concerns might become pressing. However, by several measures, the imprint of U.S. financing needs on global capital markets has not been so large as to be problematic. At roughly 25 percent of GDP, the net external debt of the United States is still below that of several other industrial economies, including the Netherlands (30 percent), Finland (40 percent), and Australia (60 percent). Moreover, even though the United States has been a net debtor since 1986, the net income on the international investment position has remained positive, as the rate of return on U.S. investments abroad continues to exceed that on foreign investments in the United States. From the standpoint of investor portfolios, notwithstanding years of large current account deficits, the share of U.S. equities in global equities actually fell from 49 percent in 1997 to 47 percent in 2002; the U.S. share in the global bond market moved up only marginally during the same period, from 42 percent to 44 percent. Finally, current account adjustment may be prompted by increases in U.S. saving. Concerns about the expanding budget deficit may prompt some reining in of fiscal policy, leading to a reduction of public sector dissaving. In the private sector, personal saving rates remain extremely low by historical standards and thus may revert to earlier norms at some point. Either of these developments would boost total domestic savings and, all else being equal, cut into the current account deficit. Although we cannot know the time frame over which capital flows may begin to shift or U.S. demand for imports to lessen, so far there appears to have been no loss of appetite for dollar-denominated assets. The dollar has declined since early 2002, but net private capital inflows have remained strong. In the first two months of this year, net private foreign purchases of U.S. securities, which are admittedly volatile, averaged about $60 billion, well above the $33 billion monthly pace reached in 2001 and 2002, when the dollar was much higher. Moreover, while I am not privy to their plans, I note that foreign authorities, who are increasingly large holders of dollars, currently show few signs of substantially adjusting the composition of their balance sheets. How might a current account adjustment affect the U.S. and global economies? If a substantial current account adjustment is required, how might it take place, and what might be its effects? As to the first of these questions, three mechanisms might induce a narrowing of the current account deficit. First, a fall of U.S. prices below foreign prices could raise our competitiveness. Prices have become relatively stable, by historical standards, in the United States and its trading partners, however, and, it is not clear how much of a dent this could put in the trade deficit. A second possibility is that an increase of foreign growth above U.S. growth could boost our exports. Between 1970 and 1995, foreign GDP growth, weighted by U.S. trade, exceeded U.S. growth by nearly 2/3 percentage point annually; since then, U.S. growth has exceeded foreign growth by 1/4 percentage point. Thus, there is some potential for foreign growth to rise relative to U.S. growth. Finally, price adjustments through exchange rate adjustment, by encouraging exports and making imports more costly, could play a role in current account adjustment. I must emphasize that, no matter how the U.S. external imbalance is narrowed, the level and composition of demand, both in the United States and abroad, would have to change. Such a change, in turn, would require adjustments of relative prices. In the United States, to accommodate increases in exports relative to imports, changes in relative prices would be needed to shift production toward internationally traded goods and services and to shift consumption toward nontraded goods and services. By the same token, adjustment by our trading partners to a reduction in the U.S. current account deficit would require both an increased domestic demand to maintain the overall level of economic activity and an adjustment of relative prices to raise the share of nontraded goods in production and of traded goods in consumption. The prospect of a correction in the current account is often portrayed in ominous tones, a dark storm cloud looming on the economic horizon. Yet, the economic adjustments I have just described are both feasible and, properly managed, need not lead to undue distress, either in the United States or abroad. After the dollar correction of the mid-1980s, for example, economic activity in the United States continued to expand as the growth of domestic demand eased but was replaced by strong contributions from net exports. During that period, analogous adjustments helped to maintain economic performance among our trading partners. The pace of GDP growth in the foreign G7 economies, weighted by U.S. exports, increased from about 2-1/2 percent during 1982-84 to nearly 4 percent in 1985-87 as greater domestic demand growth compensated for weaker performance in net exports. U.S. current account adjustment could, in fact, be associated with quite favorable scenarios for the global economy. For example, the rise in foreign productivity growth that I touched on earlier could work through several channels to narrow the U.S. trade deficit as funds were attracted abroad. Strong domestic demand among our trading partners would likely outweigh any drag resulting from appreciation of their currencies, while U.S. exports would benefit from both a change in relative prices and stronger foreign growth. Of course, the financial press frequently points to less-favorable scenarios, including the so-called disorderly correction, that is, a rapid fall in the dollar that engenders a steep falloff in U.S. bond and equity prices and that perhaps disrupts other national markets as well. I have seen little evidence to suggest that this scenario is likely, notwithstanding its popularity. The fall in the dollar since early 2002 has not disrupted financial markets, nor did the dollar's previous correction in the 1980s. Moreover, most U.S. external debt is in dollars, so currency depreciation is unlikely to lead to the balance-sheet problems that arise during financial crises in developing countries, although obviously some parties that have not taken precautions would take losses. That said, central bankers are paid to be prudent and watchful, and we will obviously continue to monitor closely international financial markets and their effects on the U.S. economy. Looking ahead, I see no obvious indications that the external sector poses significant concerns for growth or stability. Not only has the decline in the dollar to date failed to disrupt U.S. financial markets, but most would judge that, on balance, it has had only modest effects on inflation. Consumer spending is continuing to rise strongly and, although activity in housing markets has eased a bit, on balance, from the brisk pace of late last year, both sales and construction remain at high levels. In the business sector, spending on equipment and software appears to be increasing quite strongly, although outlays for nonresidential structures have remained weak. As has been the case over the past half-year, because of sizable increases in productivity, businesses seem to be able to boost production without adding much to their payrolls. Going forward, policy makers will have to determine whether the improvements signaled in some recent labor market measures indicate that the economy is on a sustainable path to closing the pool of underutilized resources. Although it has depressed job creation in the short run, increasing productivity is positive for the economy's long-run outlook and the creation of wealth. Due, in part, to these same increases in productivity, inflationary pressures have generally been muted. Now the process of disinflation appears to have ceased, and inflation has apparently stabilized. However, we cannot be complacent regarding inflation and inflation expectations. Should the Federal Reserve conclude that the maintenance of price stability is in jeopardy, I am confident that it will act appropriately. Conclusion To conclude, a change in the tone of international financial markets that required a substantial adjustment of the U.S. current account would obviously have important implications for spending and economic activity, both here and abroad. However, such adjustment, properly handled, need not derail the global economy nor cloud the bright prospects that the United States and Europe--linked by myriad ties of commerce, communications, culture, and political tradition--share.
Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Bureau of Engraving and Printing U.S. Secret Service For Immediate Release April 26, 2004 U.S. Unveils New $50 Note With Background Colors U.S. government officials from the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the United States Secret Service, today unveiled the new $50 note design with enhanced security features, and subtle background colors of blue and red, and images of a waving American flag and a small metallic silver-blue star. The new design is part of the governmentï¿½s ongoing efforts to stay ahead of counterfeiting and protect the integrity of U.S. currency. The new $50 note, which will be issued in late September or early October, is the second denomination in the Series 2004 currency. The first was the $20 note, which began circulating in October 2003. ï¿½U.S. currency is a worldwide symbol of security and integrity. These new designs help us keep it that way, by protecting against counterfeiting and making it easier for people to confirm the authenticity of their hard-earned money,ï¿½ U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said. ï¿½In addition to keeping our currency safe from counterfeiters, the President's economic policies are ensuring that more of those dollars stay in the pockets of American families.ï¿½ Snow was joined at the unveiling of the new $50 noteï¿½s design by Federal Reserve Board Governor Mark W. Olson, Tom Ferguson, director of the Treasuryï¿½s Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which produces U.S. currency, and C. Danny Spriggs, deputy director of the United States Secret Service, the law enforcement agency responsible for combating counterfeiting. The new $50 note was unveiled at the Bureau of Engraving and Printingï¿½s Western Currency Facility (WCF) in Ft. Worth, TX, and the occasion also marked the grand opening of the WCFï¿½s new Visitor Center. The Visitor Center, which plans to welcome 500,000 guests annually, will offer free tours to the public five days a week beginning on April 27, and provides a much-anticipated tourism draw to the Dallas-Ft. Worth community. At the Visitor Center, guests will be able to enjoy tours of the production facility, learn about the technology and history of U.S. currency through interactive displays, and purchase money-themed items and souvenirs in the gift shop. The WCF, which prints 55 percent of all U.S. paper currency, is the only location other than the Bureauï¿½s Washington, DC, facility that prints the nationï¿½s currency, and it will also be printing the first run of the newly redesigned $50 note. The new $50 notes will be safer, smarter and more secure currency: safer because they will be harder to fake and easier to check; smarter to stay ahead of tech-savvy counterfeiters; more secure to protect the integrity of U.S. currency. ï¿½We want the public to know how to use the security features to protect their hard-earned money,ï¿½ said Spriggs. ï¿½The combined efforts of public education, aggressive law enforcement, and improved currency security features have increased public awareness and have helped in the fight against counterfeiting.ï¿½ Despite counterfeitersï¿½ increasing use of technology, advanced counterfeit deterrence efforts on the part of the authorities has kept counterfeiting at low levels. Current estimates put the rate of counterfeit $50 notes in circulation worldwide at less than 1 note for every 25,000 genuine $50 notes in circulation. ï¿½A sound currency, which this new $50 note will foster, is a pivotal factor in the strength of our economy,ï¿½ said Olson. He said preparations for issuing the new $50 note will include educational outreach to businesses, financial institutions and consumers that use the denomination most. ï¿½Our objective is a smooth transition for the newly designed currency into daily cash transactions. For that to happen, it must be recognized and honored as legal tender, and those who use it and handle it must know how to verify its authenticity.ï¿½ The $50 note will be followed later by a new $100 note. Decisions on new designs for the $5 and $10 notes are still under consideration, but a redesign of the $1 and $2 notes is not planned. Even after the new money is issued, older-design notes will remain legal tender. Because counterfeiters are turning increasingly to digital methods and as advances in technology make digital counterfeiting easier and cheaper, the government is staying ahead of counterfeiters by updating the currency every 7-10 years. ï¿½We have to stay ahead of technology, which is developing and progressing at an ever-increasing rate. Items like digital printers and higher quality scanners are becoming more readily available at cheaper prices,ï¿½ said Ferguson. ï¿½So we have to make our currency notes safer, smarter and more secure in order to stay ahead of the would-be counterfeiters.ï¿½ The New Color of Money While consumers should not use color to check the authenticity of their currency (relying instead on user-friendly security features ï¿½ see below), color does add complexity to the note, making counterfeiting more difficult. Different colors will be used for different denominations, which will help everyone ï¿½ particularly those who are visually impaired ï¿½ to tell denominations apart. The new notes feature subtle background colors and highlight historical symbols of Americana. The $50 note, which will be issued in late 2004, includes subtle background colors of blue and red, and images of a waving American flag and a small metallic silver-blue star. Security Features The new $50 design retains three important security features that were first introduced in the 1990s and are easy for consumers and merchants alike to check: Watermark: a faint image, similar to the portrait, which is part of the paper itself and is visible from both sides when held up to the light. Security thread: also visible from both sides when held up to the light, this vertical strip of plastic is embedded in the paper and spells out the denomination in tiny print. Color-shifting ink: the numeral in the lower right corner on the face of the note, indicating its denomination, changes color when the note is tilted. Because these features are difficult for counterfeiters to reproduce well, they often do not try. Counterfeiters are hoping that cash-handlers and the public will not check their money closely. Counterfeiting: Increasingly Digital Counterfeiters are increasingly turning to digital methods, as advances in technology make digital counterfeiting of currency easier and cheaper. In 1995, less than 1 percent of counterfeit notes detected in the U.S. were digitally produced. Since then, digital equipment has become more readily available to the general public, and as a result, the amount of digitally produced counterfeit notes has risen. Over the last several years, the amount of digitally produced counterfeit notes has remained steady at about 40 percent. Law enforcement has remained aggressive. In 2003, the U.S. Secret Service made 469 seizures of digital equipment involved in currency counterfeiting, such as personal computers, and made more than 3,640 arrests in the U.S. for currency counterfeiting activities. The conviction rate for counterfeiting prosecutions is about 99 percent. Public Education Public recognition of the currency features, which increased to 85 percent in the United States as a result of the public education effort for the new $20 note , is an important factor in counterfeit deterrence. Because the improved security features are more effective if the public knows about them, the U.S. Government is undertaking a broad public education program. This program will ensure that people all over the world know the new currency is coming, and help them recognize and use the security features. The outreach will include cash-handlers, merchants, business and industry associations and the media. There is nearly $700 billion in circulation worldwide and as much as two-thirds of U.S. currency is held outside the United States, therefore, the public education program will extend worldwide.

U.S. government officials from the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the United States Secret Service, today unveiled the new $50 note design with enhanced security features, and subtle background colors of blue and red, and images of a waving American flag and a small metallic silver-blue star. The new design is part of the governmentï¿½s ongoing efforts to stay ahead of counterfeiting and protect the integrity of U.S. currency. The new $50 note, which will be issued in late September or early October, is the second denomination in the Series 2004 currency. The first was the $20 note, which began circulating in October 2003. ï¿½U.S. currency is a worldwide symbol of security and integrity. These new designs help us keep it that way, by protecting against counterfeiting and making it easier for people to confirm the authenticity of their hard-earned money,ï¿½ U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said. ï¿½In addition to keeping our currency safe from counterfeiters, the President's economic policies are ensuring that more of those dollars stay in the pockets of American families.ï¿½ Snow was joined at the unveiling of the new $50 noteï¿½s design by Federal Reserve Board Governor Mark W. Olson, Tom Ferguson, director of the Treasuryï¿½s Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which produces U.S. currency, and C. Danny Spriggs, deputy director of the United States Secret Service, the law enforcement agency responsible for combating counterfeiting. The new $50 note was unveiled at the Bureau of Engraving and Printingï¿½s Western Currency Facility (WCF) in Ft. Worth, TX, and the occasion also marked the grand opening of the WCFï¿½s new Visitor Center. The Visitor Center, which plans to welcome 500,000 guests annually, will offer free tours to the public five days a week beginning on April 27, and provides a much-anticipated tourism draw to the Dallas-Ft. Worth community. At the Visitor Center, guests will be able to enjoy tours of the production facility, learn about the technology and history of U.S. currency through interactive displays, and purchase money-themed items and souvenirs in the gift shop.

Remarks by Governor Mark W. Olson At the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's Western Currency Facility, Fort Worth, Texas April 26, 2004 Preview of the Redesigned Series 2004 U.S. $50 Note Thank you, Tom. I am very pleased to join Treasury Secretary Snow in this unveiling ceremony for the Treasury Department's newly designed $50 note. This $50 note is beautifully designed and includes important anti-counterfeiting features. The portrait of Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States, was based on a photograph taken by the renowned photographer Matthew Brady. Grant assumed the U.S. presidency only eight years after the Congress, in 1861, first authorized the issuance of paper money in the United States. Before then, in what is referred to as the free banking era, state bank notes were the chief form of paper currency. Because there was neither a consistent design nor central control over currency issuance, an estimated one- third of all currency in circulation at that time may have been counterfeit. Since 1861, the U.S. government has continuously worked to instill confidence in and maintain the integrity of our currency. In 1863, the Congress passed the National Banking Act, which regulated the issuance of notes by national banks. The act also imposed a tax on state-chartered bank notes, which essentially eliminated these notes from circulation. Two years later, the Congress established the Secret Service to guard against counterfeiting. In 1913, the Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act, which created the Federal Reserve as the nation's central bank, with authority to issue U.S. currency. At that time, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury assumed control of the issuance and design of U.S. currency. Since then the Fed and the Treasury have worked collaboratively in this joint responsibility. In its role as issuing authority, the Federal Reserve has an obligation to protect the integrity and stability of Federal Reserve notes. The Federal Reserve accomplishes this objective by working with the Treasury and its Bureau of Engraving and Printing, as well as the Secret Service, in developing design concepts for currency that the Secretary of the Treasury ultimately approves. The newly designed $50 note is a product of this close and ongoing cooperation. As for fighting counterfeiting, however, the job is never finished. In this world of rapidly changing technology, the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and Secret Service must continue to be alert to emerging threats to U.S currency, and continue to design currency that will address tomorrow's risks. During the days of President Grant, virtually all U.S. currency circulated only domestically and was only a small fraction of the amount that circulates today. Just in the past twenty years, U.S. currency in circulation has quadrupled to nearly $700 billion and is now widely held outside the country. As a global currency, Federal Reserve notes must continue to reflect the strength and stability of our economy. A sound currency, which this new $50 note will help foster, is a pivotal factor in the strength of our economy. Our objective is a smooth transition for the newly designed currency into daily cash transactions. For that to happen, it must be recognized and honored as legal tender, and those who use it and handle it must know how to verify its authenticity. The Federal Reserve, in cooperation with the other agencies represented here today, is committed to maintaining the confidence in and the integrity of our currency that are so critical to our economy. Thank you.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Energy Before the Center for Strategic & International Studies, Washington, D.C. April 27, 2004 The dramatic rise in six-year forward futures prices for crude oil and natural gas over the past few years has received relatively little attention for an economic event that can significantly affect the long-term path of the U.S. economy. Six years is a period long enough to seek, discover, drill, and lift oil and gas, and hence futures prices at that horizon can be viewed as effective long-term supply prices. These elevated long-term prices, if sustained, could alter the magnitude of and manner in which the United States consumes energy. Until recently, long-term expectations of oil and gas prices appeared benign. When choosing capital projects, businesses could mostly look through short-run fluctuations in prices to moderate prices over the longer haul. The recent shift in expectations, however, has been substantial enough and persistent enough to influence business investment decisions, especially for facilities that require large quantities of natural gas. Although the effect of these developments on energy-related investments is significant, it doubtless will fall far short of the large changes in our capital stock that followed the 1970s surge in crude oil prices. The energy intensity of the United States economy has been reduced by almost half since the early 1970s. Much of the energy displacement occurred by 1985, within a few years of the peak in the real price of oil. Progress in reducing energy intensity has continued since then, but at a lessened pace. This more-modest pace should not be surprising, given the generally lower level of real oil and natural gas prices that prevailed between 1985 and 2000 and that carried over into electric power prices. * * * The production side of the oil and gas markets also has changed dramatically over the past decade. Technological changes taking place are likely to make existing energy reserves stretch further and to keep long-term energy costs lower than they otherwise would have been. Seismic techniques and satellite imaging, which are facilitating the discovery of promising new reservoirs of crude oil and natural gas worldwide, have nearly doubled the success rate of new-field wildcat wells in the United States during the past decade. New techniques allow far deeper drilling of promising fields, especially offshore. The newer innovations in recovery are reported to have increased significantly the average proportion of oil and, to a lesser extent, gas reserves eventually brought to the surface. One might expect that, as a consequence of what has been a dramatic shift from the hit-or-miss wildcat oil and gas exploration and development of the past to more-advanced technologies, the cost of developing new fields and, hence, the long-term supply price of new oil and gas would have declined. And, indeed, these costs have declined, but by less than might otherwise have been the case. Much of the innovation in oil development outside OPEC, for example, has been directed at overcoming an increasingly inhospitable and costly exploratory environment, the consequence of more than a century of draining the more immediately accessible sources of crude oil. Still, distant futures prices for crude oil moved lower, on net, during the 1990s as a result of declining long-term marginal costs of extraction. The most-distant futures prices fell from a bit more than $20 per barrel just before the first Gulf War to $16 to $18 a barrel in 1999. Distant futures for natural gas, which were less than $2 per million Btu at the time of the first Gulf War drifted up to $2.50 per million Btu by 1999, although those prices remained below the prices of oil on an equivalent Btu basis. Such long-term price tranquility has faded noticeably over the past four years. Between 1990 and 2000, although spot prices ranged between $11 and $35 per barrel, distant futures exhibited little variation. Currently prices for delivery in 2010 of light sweet crude, roughly equal to West Texas intermediate, have risen to more than $27 per barrel. A similar pattern is evident in natural gas. Even the spikes in the spot price in 2000 had only a temporary effect on distant natural gas futures prices. That situation changed in 2001, however, when the distant futures prices for gas delivery at the Henry Hub began a rise from $3.20 per million Btu to almost $5 today. The reasons for the sharp increases in both crude and gas distant futures prices seem reasonably straightforward, though they differ in important respects. The strength of crude oil prices presumably reflects fears of long-term supply disruptions in the Middle East that have resulted in an increase in risk premiums being added to the cost of capital. Although there are competitive spillovers from the higher price of oil, the causes of the rise in the long-term supply price of natural gas appear related primarily to supply and demand in North America. * * * Today's tight natural gas markets have been a long time in coming. Little more than a half-century ago, drillers seeking valuable crude oil bemoaned the discovery of natural gas. Given the lack of adequate transportation, wells had to be capped or the gas flared. As the U.S. economy expanded after World War II, the development of a vast interstate transmission system facilitated widespread consumption of natural gas in our homes and business establishments. By 1970, natural gas consumption, on a heat-equivalent basis, had risen to three-fourths that of oil. But in the following decade consumption lagged because of competitive inroads made by coal and nuclear power. Since 1985, natural gas has gradually increased its share in total energy use and, owing to its status as a clean-burning fuel, is projected by the Energy Information Administration of the United States to maintain that higher share over the next quarter century. Dramatic changes in technology in recent years, while making existing natural gas reserves stretch further, have been unable, in the face of inexorably rising demand, to keep the underlying long-term price for natural gas in the United States from rising. * * * Over the past few decades, short-term movements in domestic prices in the markets for crude oil have been determined largely by international market participants, especially OPEC. But that was not always the case. In the early years of oil development, pricing power was firmly in the hands of Americans, predominately John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil. Reportedly appalled by the volatility of crude oil prices in the early years of the petroleum industry, Rockefeller endeavored with some success to control those prices. After the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, pricing power remained with the United States--first with the U.S. oil companies and later with the Texas Railroad Commission, which raised allowable output to suppress price spikes and cut output to prevent sharp declines. Indeed, as late as 1952 U.S. crude oil production still accounted for more than half of the world total. However, that historical role came to an end in 1971, when excess capacity in the United States was finally absorbed by rising demand. At that point, the marginal pricing of oil, which for so long had been resident on the gulf coast of Texas, moved to the Persian Gulf. To capitalize on their newly acquired pricing power, many producing nations in the Middle East nationalized their oil companies. But the full magnitude of their pricing power became evident only in the aftermath of the oil embargo of 1973. During that period, posted crude oil prices at Ras Tanura rose to more than $11 per barrel, significantly above the $1.80 per barrel that had been unchanged from 1961 to 1970. The sharp price increases of the early 1970s brought to an abrupt end the extraordinary period of growth in U.S. oil consumption and the increased intensity of its use that was so evident in the decades immediately following World War II. Between 1945 and 1973, consumption of oil products rose at a startling 4-1/2 percent average annual rate, well in excess of growth of real gross domestic product. However, since 1973, oil consumption has grown, on average, only 1/2 percent per year, far short of the rise in real GDP. Although OPEC production quotas have been a significant factor in price determination for a third of a century, the story since 1973 has been as much one of the power of markets as of power over markets. The signals provided by market prices have eventually resolved even the most seemingly insurmountable difficulties of inadequate domestic supply in the United States. The gap projected between supply and demand in the immediate post-1973 period was feared by many to be so large that rationing would be the only practical solution. But the resolution did not occur quite that way. To be sure, mandated fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks accompanied slower growth of gasoline demand. Some observers argue, however, that, even without government-enforced standards, market forces would have produced increased fuel efficiency. Indeed, the number of small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars that were imported into the United States markets grew significantly in the late 1970s after the Iranian Revolution drove up crude oil prices to nearly $40 per barrel. Moreover, at that time, prices were expected to go still higher. Projections of $50 per barrel or more were widely prevalent. Our Department of Energy had baseline projections showing prices reaching $60 per barrel--the equivalent of more than twice that in today's prices. The failure of oil prices to rise as projected in the late 1970s is a testament to the power of markets and the technologies they foster. Today, despite its recent surge, the price of crude oil in real terms is only half of what it was in December 1979. As I indicated earlier, the rise in six-year oil and gas futures prices is almost surely going to affect the growth of oil and gas consumption in the United States and the nature of the capital stock investments currently under contemplation. However, the responses are likely to differ somewhat between plans for oil and those for gas usage. OPEC, the source of greatest supply flexibility, has endeavored to calibrate crude oil liftings to price. They fear that significant supply excesses will drive down prices and revenues, whereas too low a level of output will elevate prices to a point that will induce long-term reductions in demand for oil and in the associated long-term revenues to be earned from oil. Natural gas pricing, on the other hand, is inherently far more volatile than oil, doubtless reflecting, in part, less-developed, price-damping global trade. Because gas is particularly challenging to transport in its cryogenic form as a liquid, imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) into the United States to date have been negligible, accounting for only 2 percent of U.S. gas supply in 2003. Environmental and safety concerns and cost considerations have limited the number of terminals available for importing LNG. Canada, which has recently supplied a sixth of our consumption, has little capacity to significantly expand its exports, in part because of the role that Canadian gas plays in supporting growing oil production from tar sands. Given notable cost reductions for both liquefaction and transportation of LNG, significant global trade is developing. And high natural gas prices projected by distant futures prices have made imported gas a more attractive option for us. According to the tabulations of BP, worldwide imports of natural gas in 2002 were only 23 percent of world consumption, compared with 57 percent for oil. Clearly, the gas trade has a long way to go. The gap in the behaviors of the markets for oil and for natural gas is readily observable. The prices of crude oil and products are subject to much price arbitrage, which has the effect of encouraging the transportation of supplies from areas of relative surplus to those of relative shortage and of thereby containing local price spikes. This effect was most vividly demonstrated in 2003, when Venezuelan oil production was essentially shut down. American refiners with unlimited access to world supplies were able to replace lost oil with diversions from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. If North American natural gas markets are to function with the flexibility exhibited by oil, more extensive access to the vast world reserves of gas is required. Markets need to be able to adjust effectively to unexpected shortfalls in domestic supply in the same way that they do in oil. Access to world natural gas supplies will require a major expansion of LNG terminal import capacity and the development of the newer offshore re-gasification technologies. Without the flexibility such facilities impart, imbalances in supply and demand must inevitably engender price volatility. As the technology of LNG liquefaction and shipping has improved and as safety considerations have lessened, a major expansion of U.S. import capability appears to be under way. These movements bode well for widespread natural gas availability in North America in the next decade and beyond. The near term, however, is apt to continue to be challenging.
Thank you for inviting me to report on the Federal Reserve's activities in support of new currency design and coin distribution. There has been a great deal of activity in the past few years. To deter counterfeiting, in October 2003, the Reserve Banks issued a redesigned $20 note, and on Monday, we helped unveil the design for the new $50 note, which will be issued beginning this fall. Last month, the Reserve Banks distributed the first of two new nickel designs to be issued in 2004 as part of the Westward Journey series. The Reserve Banks also continue to distribute a newly designed quarter every ten weeks as part of the fifty-state quarter program. Before turning to the specific issues raised by the Subcommittee, it may be helpful to describe briefly the Federal Reserve's roles in currency issuance and coin distribution. Currency Issuance and Coin Distribution One of the Federal Reserve's key responsibilities is to ensure that enough currency and coin is available to meet the public's needs. In that role, the Reserve Banks provide wholesale cash--currency and coin--services to depository institutions, which, in turn, provide cash services to the general public. Each year the Federal Reserve Board determines the need for new currency, which it purchases from the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) at approximately the cost of production. The Reserve Banks issue Federal Reserve notes at face value, and these notes are recorded as liabilities on the Reserve Banks' balance sheets. The Reserve Banks, as required by law, pledge collateral (principally U.S. Treasury securities) equal to the face value of currency in circulation. Federal Reserve notes accounted for about 95 percent of the almost $716 billion of currency and coin in circulation as of March 31, 2004. The Federal Reserve's role in providing coins is more limited. The United States Mint (the Mint) issues circulating coins that the Reserve Banks purchase at face value and distribute, at the wholesale level, to depository institutions. These institutions, in turn, provide coins to the public. The Reserve Banks now distribute about 90 percent of coin orders and deposits through operators of coin terminals, which are predominantly armored carriers. Coins represent about five percent of total currency and coin in circulation, or about $35 billion, as of March 31, 2004. Currency Design Although the Secretary of the Treasury, and not the Federal Reserve, has authority to approve new currency designs, the Federal Reserve works actively and collaboratively with the Treasury, the Secret Service, and the BEP to analyze and recommend counterfeit deterrence strategies to the Secretary. We monitor and analyze currency flows and counterfeiting data both domestically and internationally to understand better the use of U.S. currency, as well as incidents of counterfeiting. The Federal Reserve also maintains close contact with commercial banks that provide currency internationally, as well as with other central banks, to monitor counterfeiting activity at the international level. Counterfeit-deterrent features in U.S. currency continue to evolve to ensure public confidence in the security of Federal Reserve notes. The Series-2004 design changes to the $20 note added complex colored line patterns and a system to deter digital counterfeiting, while maintaining the watermark, security thread, and color-shifting ink of the 1996 design. Ongoing research is aimed at defending against future threats, especially those posed by continued improvements in, and the low-cost availability of, inkjet printers and other devices used to digitally counterfeit U.S. currency. For instance, the Federal Reserve and the BEP have devoted significant resources to a twenty-seven nation effort, through the Bank for International Settlements, to combat color copier and inkjet counterfeiting. The Federal Reserve appreciates the assistance of a number of private companies in the United States and abroad that have worked with us voluntarily to deploy technology in their products that will protect their customers and the public from the risks of counterfeit currency. These efforts are a key component of the three-pronged U.S. counterfeit deterrence strategy that relies on currency designs, public education, and law enforcement. Although the focus of today's hearing is primarily on design issues, I would like to emphasize that public education and law enforcement also play a vital role in counterfeit deterrence. Adjustments by Reserve Banks to Improve Coin Distribution Turning to recent experience with coins, for the past several years, the Reserve Banks have worked to reduce inefficiencies by implementing a program to manage their coin distribution from a national perspective. For example, the Reserve Banks now provide the Mint with a single monthly coin order for all districts, together with five-month projections of future needs. The Reserve Banks have also worked closely with armored carriers and depository institutions to understand their processes and constraints in meeting the public demand for circulating commemorative coins. The result is a better balance of coin inventories across the country. The Federal Reserve worked with the Mint to implement the popular fifty state quarter program in 1999, the golden dollar coin in 2000, and most recently, the Westward Journey nickel program. The fifty state quarter and Westward Journey nickel programs have been both innovative and challenging, as implied by the term "commemorative circulating coin" that is used to describe the coins issued in the programs. Innovative, because the goal is to satisfy the demand for both a transactional and commemorative coin in a single coin, which is distributed through the normal wholesale distribution channels and whose design changes frequently. Challenging, because frequent design changes have affected the Reserve Banks' inventory and payment processes that are designed to meet wholesale demand efficiently. Challenging also because heightened public expectations that circulating commemoratives will be widely available can place added pressure on the wholesale distribution system. To adjust to these new commemorative circulating coins, the Reserve Banks have changed their payment practices. For example, as the Mint issues each new coin design, Reserve Banks have suspended their normal practice of first paying out previously circulated coins to depository institutions, and instead have paid out the new designs for initial introductory periods ranging from a few weeks to two years, in the case of the golden dollar. Demand for Dollar Coins The Mint and the General Accounting Office (GAO) have identified a number of factors that influence the demand for dollar coins. The title of the GAO's 2002 report, New Dollar Coin Marketing Campaign Raised Public Awareness but not Widespread Use , confirms the Federal Reserve's experience in distributing dollar coins. Publicity campaigns and promotions raise public interest in coins as collectibles but do not address the impediments to transactional use. provides a rough estimate of the number of golden dollars available for use in transactions. The GAO reported a number of barriers to widespread circulation of dollar coins, including the following: Co-circulation with dollar notes : the public generally prefers to carry notes because they weigh less. Network effects : there is interdependency of demand, in that individuals are unlikely to use dollar coins until retailers stock them, and retailers will not stock them until the public uses them. Banks and armored carriers will not invest in inventory and equipment to handle the coins until they perceive significant demand for the coins. Higher fees for distribution of coins rather than notes : armored carriers charge higher fees to transport coins than notes, and charge to roll both new and recirculated coins. While all of these factors affect the demand for dollar coins, surveys and reports consistently identify the dollar note as the principal barrier to successful circulation of dollar coins. Nevertheless, dollar coins are regularly used in certain markets. Overall for 2003, the Reserve Banks report average monthly dollar coin payments of $15.2 million, average monthly receipts of $9.5 million, and average monthly net payments of $5.7 million. Operators of vending and Postal Service machines, public transit, and some toll roads dispense dollar coins in change. The Reserve Banks' largest depository-institution customers have indicated that public transit authorities and the Postal Service are the principal users of dollar coins. Although neither of these groups has expressed a preference for one design of dollar coin over another, other businesses have requested that Reserve Banks make available golden dollars segregated from Susan B. Anthony (SBA) coins. Reserve Banks, however, do not sort individual coins and have no machines that are able to distinguish between the two types of circulating dollar coins. Susan B. Anthony coins, however, could be removed from circulation if the Mint were to purchase dollar coins received by Reserve Banks from circulation, sort the coins, and destroy the SBAs or place them into long-term storage. We understand that the premise of such a program is that the public's total demand for dollar coins could increase if unmixed golden dollars were available rather than commingled SBAs and golden dollars. In general, a program to remove SBAs from circulation would need to consider the seigniorage that could be gained from greater circulation of golden dollars in relation to the costs of the program, and the potential savings to society from an overall increase in the use of dollar coins relative to one-dollar notes. Recent Experience with Dollar Coins, Quarters, and Nickels The recent experience of the Reserve Banks with changes in coin design has generally been that inventories and operating costs for coins have increased. Reserve Banks acquired sufficient inventories of dollar coins in the first two years of golden dollar circulation to satisfy the demand by depository institutions for most of the following two years. Despite efforts by the Reserve Banks, the Mint, and depository institutions to manage demand, inventories of quarters at Reserve Banks are now more than triple their 1999 level. From 1999 to 2003, Reserve Bank direct costs for distributing coins have increased at an average annual rate of about 12 percent, three times the rate of Reserve Bank direct costs for distributing currency. The increases in Reserve Bank coin inventories and costs result largely from a mismatch between the Federal Reserve's role as the wholesale distributor of coins to depository institutions and public demand for commemorative coins in small quantities. The Reserve Banks' coin distribution system is designed to satisfy depository institutions' needs for large quantities of coins for transactional purposes. Publicity about new coin designs understandably encourages consumers' interest in the coins, but so far much of the demand has reflected individuals' desires to collect one or two coins of each design. In this situation, frequent changes in design result in large initial payments of new design coins to depository institutions and the subsequent return of coins after the initial demand for collectibles and ongoing transactional demand have been met. In addition, the Reserve Banks and depository institutions absorb the costs of ordering and distributing coins that are broadly intended for transactional use, including circulating commemoratives. Overall, the wholesale coin distribution system is designed to be efficient for distributing large numbers of coins for transactional purposes, but is less efficient at distributing the relatively small number of coins needed to satisfy public demand for commemoratives. Dollars at the end of my statement shows that net payments of dollar coins surged to more than $558 million in 2000, but dropped sharply in the succeeding years. Publicity and efforts to stimulate demand caused net payments of dollar coins to rise sharply in 2000, and payments continued at an elevated, though decreasing, rate through 2002. During 2003, total net payments of dollar coins to circulation were about $69 million, which represents a return to a level of annual payments experienced in the five years before the introduction of the golden dollar created temporary heightened demand. On March 31, 2004, Reserve Banks held more than $92 million in dollar coins, approximately the target inventory level for meeting transactional demand. Quarters The Federal Reserve has issued a new state quarter design every ten weeks since January 1999. The public's interest in the widely publicized state quarters caused the Reserve Banks to distribute as many as 1.6 billion pieces of a single state quarter design in the early days of the program. shows that Reserve Bank quarter inventories averaged nearly $621 million in 2002. Knowing that existing inventories will satisfy transactional demand for some time, the Reserve Banks, since 2002, have ordered 450 million of each new state quarter, an amount that satisfies consumer demand. Although this initiative reduced the growth of Reserve Bank quarter inventories, on March 31, 2004, the Reserve Banks still held more than $515 million in quarters, which is approximately $183 million more than the target level for the upper limit of inventory needed to satisfy transactional demand. Nickels The Federal Reserve and the Mint used lessons learned from the golden dollar and state quarter programs to manage the distribution of the new Westward Journey nickel designs. A number of factors seem to have influenced a more orderly initial rollout of the first new nickel in the program. Modest initial publicity about the new design tempered public demand, and perhaps most importantly, there will be no more than two new nickel designs this year and next. Transactional demand for nickels is significantly lower than for quarters, allowing the Reserve Banks to reduce their inventories of old design nickels for months in anticipation of the issue of the new design. The Reserve Banks initially ordered 300 million nickels, which were positioned in most of their locations before the release date. The objective was to make sufficient quantities available in the first four weeks of circulation when demand is highest for commemorative coins. The initial introduction has gone smoothly. It is still a bit early, however, to assess fully the success of these measures in managing inventories of nickels. Conclusion The Federal Reserve is working closely with the BEP and the Secret Service to define the appropriate timing for introducing design changes for the $100 Federal Reserve note, and to assess whether to add additional counterfeit deterrence features to the $5 and $10 notes. With regard to coins, it is important to recognize that there are significant uncertainties about the effects of additional changes to circulating coin designs, particularly to dollar coins. The Federal Reserve's experiences since 1999 suggest that flexibility in implementing new coin programs, along with care in publicizing them, will allow us to address better the inventory and distribution challenges of these programs. For example, the smooth introduction of the first new nickel and experience thus far suggests that there are advantages to releasing no more than two new designs per year. This rate of introduction, at least for widely circulating coins, allows the Reserve Banks more time to draw down inventories of old designs and build up stocks of new designs for the initial distribution. If experience shows over time that higher rates of introduction can be managed effectively, the Reserve Banks and the Mint could increase the rate of introduction in accordance with carefully prepared plans. In addition, alternative distribution strategies that complement wholesale distribution could be explored. Finally, we would advise against unduly stimulating public interest in new designs, which appears to cause intense initial interest and to place significant pressure on Reserve Banks and depository institutions, with limited long-term changes in transactional demand. We are very concerned that there could be significant public frustration with depository institutions and the Reserve Banks if expectations are not met for the distribution of new coins. If long-term demand grows slowly, depository institutions and the Reserve Banks may need to limit the amount of dollar coins that they order in order to manage their inventories effectively. If and as long-term demand does increase, the Reserve Banks will work closely with the Mint to meet demand in accordance with their obligation to provide for an elastic currency.

Anthony coins minted from 1976 through 2000 is 970 million, of which an estimated 23 million remain in Reserve Bank inventory commingled with golden dollars (includes Reserve Bank inventory at coin terminals). 2 The estimated 67 percent held as collectibles is applied to the estimate of all golden dollars held outside of Reserve Bank and Mint inventories, including an unknown amount of inventories held by depository institutions. 3 The GAO has reported that it believes the estimated share is closer to one percent based on alternative survey methodology (see Widespread Use , p. 37). Footnotes The Federal Reserve provides cash services to more than 10,000 of the 19,000 banks, savings and loans, and credit unions in the United States. The depository institutions that choose not to obtain cash services directly from the Federal Reserve obtain cash services through correspondent banks. It is difficult to forecast demand for circulating coins. The normal demand for coins is highly seasonal and reflects retail cycles. Demand for coin is highest during summer and year-end holidays, and relatively low for the rest of the year. New Dollar Coin Marketing Campaign Raised Public Awareness but not Widespread Use . GAO-02-896, September 2002. For comparison, the Reserve Banks also introduced four new note designs during this period: Series-1996 $20 notes in 1999, Series-1996 $5 and $10 notes in 2000, and Series-2004 $20 notes in 2003. In contrast, legislation requires the Mint to recover its costs for distributing numismatic coins that are specifically intended to meet the demand of collectors. As a consequence, the Mint must charge a mark-up over the face value of coins that creates a relative disincentive for the public to obtain circulating commemoratives directly from the Mint.
