Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For Immediate Release July 2, 2004 Agencies Issue Proposed Rule on Affiliate Marketing Opt Outs The federal financial institutions supervisory agencies today issued proposed regulations that would give consumers the chance to "opt out" before a financial institution uses information provided by an affiliated company to market its products and services to the consumer. The proposed rulemaking would implement the affiliate marketing provisions in section 214 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act), which adds a new section 624 to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The proposal generally would prohibit an institution from using certain information about a consumer it receives from an affiliate to make a solicitation to the consumer unless the consumer has been given notice and an opportunity to opt out of the solicitation. An institution that has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer would not be subject to this marketing limitation. Nothing in the new affiliate marketing opt out supercedes or replaces the provisions in section 603 of the FCRA concerning the right to opt out of the sharing of information among affiliates, although there is some overlap between the two opt out requirements. The proposal is being issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision. Comment on the proposed rulemaking is requested within 30 days of its publication in the Federal Register, which is expected shortly. The Federal Register notice is attached. ### Federal Reserve Susan.K.Stawick (202) 452-2955 FDIC Frank Gresock (202) 898-6634 NCUA Cherie Umbel (202) 898-6634 OCC Dean DeBuck (202) 874-5770 OTS Erin Hickman (202) 906-6677
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced its approval of the application filed by Capital One Financial Corporation, McLean, Virginia, to become a bank holding company after the amendment of the charter of its subsidiary, Capital One Bank, Glen Allen, Virginia, from a limited-purpose, credit-card bank charter to a full-service bank charter.

Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. At the New York Association for Business Economics Meeting, New York, New York July 7, 2004 Productivity: Past, Present, and Future Thank you for the invitation to speak here today. In assessing the economic outlook, economists cannot avoid confronting the question of how fast the economy can expand without creating upward pressure on inflation. A fundamental determinant of the economy's potential growth is the sustainable rate of productivity expansion. Critical though this issue is, it does not by itself capture the importance of productivity. Besides influencing the near-term course of important economic variables, such as gross domestic product growth, inflation, and profits, productivity largely determines our society's long-term economic welfare. Productivity growth forms the foundation for improvements in living standards. And our ability to deal with budgetary challenges--such as funding the large future obligations of our Social Security and Medicare systems and, more generally, managing the nation's debt--depends critically on the future direction of productivity. Thus, knowing where productivity growth is headed is, in many respects, equivalent to foreseeing our economic destinies. In thinking about productivity in the future, it is useful to first consider how it has behaved in the distant past and more recently. The past offers lessons about the kinds of economic and political environments that have proven most effective in fostering high rates of productivity growth. And a better understanding of the forces shaping recent developments in productivity--in particular, the causes of the pickup in labor productivity growth that began in the mid-1990s and the sources of the additional post-2000 surge--can help us put sensible bounds on possible future movements in productivity. In my discussion today, I will not attempt to predict these future movements, but with the knowledge gained from studying the past and the present, I will lay out some of the conditions--both favorable and unfavorable--that are likely to influence them. As usual, my remarks represent my own views, which are not necessarily shared by other members of the Board of Governors or of the Federal Open Market Committee. The Past Over the past century and a half, three episodes stand out as especially relevant for assessing the sustainability of the current productivity boom: the late 1800s from roughly the end of the Civil War to around 1890; the decade or so between the end of World War I and the onset of the Great Depression; and the period from about 1950 to the early 1970s. In these boom periods, average labor productivity growth ranged from 2-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent, about double the average of growth rates during other periods. The striking similarities of these three episodes provide clues about the types of economic policies and other factors that have been important in promoting sustained productivity gains. Perhaps not surprisingly, all three periods were influenced heavily by the introduction of new technologies. But they were also characterized by important changes in the organization of production, in the means of financing new enterprises, and in investment in human capital that facilitated the complex process of applying these new technologies to the creation of new goods and more-efficient production processes. The productivity boom after the Civil War resulted from a variety of technological advances, including the expansion of and improvements in the use of steam power, railroad transportation, and communication by telegraph. By lowering the cost of transportation, railroad expansion allowed firms to take advantage of economies of scale in production and distribution. The telegraph's lowering of communication costs enabled firms to better coordinate movements in rail traffic and made possible more-informed and better decisions in many other industries. In the productivity boom that followed World War I, a chief technological innovation was the spread of electrification to the factory floor. By allowing each machine to be driven by its own power source, electric motors spurred the development of complex and more-productive configurations of machinery, such as the assembly line. Finally, the productivity gains of the 1950s and 1960s had their roots in a wide range of technological innovations made during the 1930s as well as in research sponsored by the military during World War II. For example, research advances in polymer chemistry, the development of new diesel and jet engine technologies, and the invention of the transistor and the integrated circuit facilitated productivity improvements in a wide range of industries and the creation of an array of highly useful consumer products. In each episode, businesses found that changes to their organizational structures allowed them to take greater advantage of the new possibilities opened up by these technological innovations. In the productivity boom of the late nineteenth century, for example, the potential for economies of scale made possible by the new technologies led to dramatic increases in firm size in many industries. Their larger size, in turn, prompted firms to implement hierarchical management systems to coordinate their greater numbers of workers and machinery and to speed the flow of information between management and the factory floor. Shorter delivery times, reduced inventory holdings, and a better match between production and orders were the beneficial results. Similarly, to take advantage of the continuous-processing technologies of the early 1900s, firms increased the scope of their operations, integrating forward into distribution and retailing and backward into materials processing. This vertical integration reduced transaction costs but required the development of new units within the firm that were not directly tied to production, such as advertising, accounting, and research departments. In the third productivity boom, large multinational and multiproduct firms arose to take further advantage of economies of size and scope. In this episode, firms created multi-divisional organizations, with each product or geographic division having its own manufacturing and marketing departments. Such a structure was well suited to a firm with diverse activities as it allowed managers to respond to changes in preferences and technologies relevant to specific areas or products. Because the implementation of new technologies often requires new capital, the productivity gains during these boom eras were also dependent on the development of efficient mechanisms to transfer capital to the entrepreneurs and firms best able to transform the potential of the new technologies into new goods and new production processes. In the productivity boom after the Civil War, for example, the increased use of secured debt and preferred stock reduced the transaction costs associated with borrowers having better information than lenders about the risks of bankruptcy and provided firms with the external funds needed to support a rapid buildup in the capital stock. In the second productivity boom, the introduction of regular audited financial statements, rating agencies, and newsletters covering firm and industry developments further reduced investors' costs of acquiring information about firms' finances, which led to a sharp expansion in equity markets and the opening of a new channel of capital flows to that period's large-sized innovators. Similarly, the growth in pension funds, mutual funds, and brokerage houses during the productivity boom of the 1950s and 1960s reduced the costs of portfolio diversification and further increased the participation of individual investors and the flow of capital available to innovators. A fourth ingredient contributing to the productivity booms of the past was the availability of a workforce capable of realizing the possibilities offered by technological innovations. In the late 1800s, new technologies increased the demand for unskilled production workers and skilled white-collar workers. Employers generally were able to satisfy these demands through existing domestic sources of such labor, augmented by substantial rates of immigration. In contrast, the complex continuous-processing technologies of the early 1900s increased the demand for skilled blue collar and white collar workers well above the available supply. But the new job opportunities and the wage premiums attached to them led to a significant increase in high-school graduation rates, which helped the supply of skills to catch up to the new demand. In much the same way, the new technologies and organizational structures of the post-World War II boom sharply increased the demand for workers in professional and technical occupations, which was quickly met by a corresponding increase in the percentage of young adults obtaining a college education. The similarities of these previous productivity booms seem to offer some valuable lessons. The first concerns the importance of "general purpose technologies," or GPTs, in promoting long-run economic growth. Many of the technological innovations associated with past productivity booms--railroads and electric power, among others--were GPTs with widespread applicability. Because such GPTs raise efficiency not only in production but also in distribution and business practices, they offer the possibility of broad-based and long-lasting improvements in productivity. Second, the new capital investment and the organizational and financial innovations that helped to turn new technological possibilities into better and cheaper goods and services generally derived from the actions of individual economic agents and not from the directives of central planners. Of course, that doesn't mean that government has no role to play in fostering economic growth. Indeed, maintaining an economic, legal, and financial environment that provides individuals with the proper incentives to invest in new technologies is an important and often challenging responsibility of government policymakers. Also, government actions can help broaden opportunities for education and support the basic research that contributes to new technological breakthroughs. Recent Developments As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, it is also important to understand the forces shaping more recent developments in productivity. From 1995 through 2003, average annual productivity growth was 3 percent, double the 1-1/2 percent rate of growth that prevailed between 1973 and 1995. Although some observers initially questioned whether the pickup in productivity growth after 1995 represented a real increase in the underlying trend of productivity growth, the passage of time and the changes in cyclical conditions occasioned by the most recent recession have produced a general consensus that the trend growth rate did indeed increase. From the fourth-quarter of 2001 through the fourth-quarter of 2003, the gains in productivity were particularly strong, at an annual average rate of growth of more than 4 percent; indeed, last year the rise in productivity was close to 5-1/2 percent. The increases in productivity experienced during this period have been an important factor, perhaps the dominant factor, in the elevated profit margins that businesses have enjoyed in the past few years. Moreover, the strong performance of productivity relative to the more modest gains in labor compensation has helped to keep inflation low. Thus, a key question is whether this elevated pace of productivity growth can be sustained. I see several reasons to believe that the additional pickup in productivity growth during the last couple of years is due primarily to cyclical factors and thus not likely to be sustained. First, the 2001 recession, by dramatically reducing profits, focused firms' attention on restructuring and cost-cutting rather than on business expansion and likely induced some one-time gains in efficiency. That firms could realize such large advances in productivity was perhaps due to their substantial, but underexploited, investments in high-tech equipment in the late 1990s; but at some point additional efficiencies from these earlier investments will be more difficult to achieve. Second, the threat of terrorist attacks, geopolitical risks, and corporate governance scandals led many employers to question the durability of the current recovery and thus made them hesitant to incur the costs of bringing on new employees. As firms chose instead to meet increases in their orders by using their existing workforces more intensively, measured productivity rose. The recovery in the labor market during the second half of 2003 and the first half of this year appears to be a sign that employers are now more confident about the economic outlook and are attempting to return workloads to a more-sustainable level. Thus, I would not be surprised if measured productivity growth over the next few years falls below the rates of the fourth-quarter 2001 through fourth-quarter 2003 period or even, for a time, below the average growth rate from 1995 through 2003. Indeed, such a drop would be an expected consequence of the pickup in hiring that now seems to be under way. The average monthly increase in private payrolls of slightly more than 200,000 during the past six months appears to have coincided with an easing in labor productivity growth. Spending and hours data for the first half of this year point to a stepdown in productivity growth from last year's pace. A second important question is whether trend productivity growth will slow as well. A pronounced deceleration in structural productivity could result in more rapidly accelerating labor costs and lower profit margins, which, in turn, could lead to a deteriorating outlook for inflation. Moreover, a deterioration in trend productivity growth would have adverse consequences for our ability to meet long-term economic challenges. The Future In my view, there are a number of reasons to expect that the stepped-up pace of underlying productivity growth that we have experienced since the mid-1990s can persist for a while longer. In particular, conditions similar to those that fostered previous productivity booms seem, on balance, to be in place today. General purpose technologies such as the personal computer, fiber optics, wireless communications, and the Internet--to give just a few examples--continue to present new avenues for raising productivity. Past deregulation should enable businesses to adapt their organizational structures in response to these new opportunities. Ongoing financial-market innovations have allowed financial intermediaries to expand the range of financing alternatives to businesses seeking external funds. And in response to the rising demand for skilled labor able to use new technologies, four-year colleges and community colleges are providing both experienced and inexperienced workers with opportunities to obtain new market-relevant skills. Nevertheless, each of the previous productivity booms eventually ended, and thus one can reasonably ask whether any developments threaten the longevity of the current boom. One hypothesis along these lines is that periods of strong productivity growth come to an end when the productivity-increasing opportunities associated with new technologies are exhausted. I think that, at this point, such concerns are premature. Sharp declines in the prices of high-tech capital equipment, spawned by the rapid rate of innovation in high-tech industries, were an important part of the productivity acceleration that began in the mid-1990s. As prices fell, firms used more high-tech capital to increase efficiencies in the production of other goods. Though productivity pessimists sometimes cite the absence of a "killer application" as an indication that the ability of high-tech capital to raise productivity in other industries is declining, the limited evidence available suggests that both the breadth and the depth of demand for new technologies remain substantial. With respect to breadth, research by Kevin Stiroh shows that the acceleration in productivity owing to investments in high-tech capital has been spread widely across industries. Regarding depth, research coauthored by Jason Cummins of the Board's staff found that, despite the high investment rates of the late 1990s, a wide gap between the technology embodied in state-of-the-art capital equipment and the technology embodied in the existing stock of equipment remains across a broad set of industries. That gap implies continued incentives for capital investment. Although the exhaustion of technological possibilities seems unlikely to slow trend productivity growth, adverse changes in the economic, legal, and financial environment could threaten the longevity of the current productivity boom. For example, economists have long noted that free trade--and the specialization and economies of scale that it affords--fosters productivity increases. That our most recent productivity boom occurred against a backdrop of freer trade and increased globalization is likely no coincidence. However, the momentum for the liberalization of global trade now appears to be facing strong resistance. A halt in the movement toward freer trade or outright backsliding, such as the erection of new barriers to the trade of goods or services, would endanger the sustainability of the current productivity boom. Some observers believe that security-enhancing limitations on the international flow of capital, labor, and goods in response to an increased terrorist threat could have similar effects. In addition, a failure to continue to vigorously address the corporate governance issues of the past few years could also threaten the current boom. As I noted earlier, the efficient channeling of capital to innovators has been a critical component of past productivity booms. Fraud or dishonesty in corporate accounts increases investors' risk, raising the cost of capital and reducing incentives for investment. Large government borrowing to fund current consumption could also raise the cost of capital and crowd out the investment on which the current boom depends. The magnitude of future government obligations to fund Social Security payments for the retiring baby-boom generation and the growing costs of providing medical care to the elderly add to the urgency to put government debt on a sustainable long-term path. Doing so sooner rather than later would make the necessary adjustments easier and diminish the likelihood of significant future economic disruptions. Some observers have also stressed the importance of large economic shocks, such as the oil price shock of the early 1970s, in bringing periods of rapid productivity growth to an end. It seems possible that the recent run-ups in energy prices, and the fact that markets expect much of them to be permanent, could reduce productivity growth by rendering energy-intensive technologies and capital obsolete. Without dismissing such concerns, one needs to keep in mind that the recent shock to date has been significantly smaller than the oil shocks of the 1970s and that the economy today is far less energy intensive than it was then. Additionally, one can take some comfort from the economy's generally strong performance in the face of the numerous economic and geopolitical shocks that buffeted it over the past several years. Despite these shocks, the most recent recession, in terms of output decline, was one of the mildest on record. Our economy's ability to weather these shocks reflects well on the institutions we have established and on the hard work and determination of the American people. Nonetheless, developments in energy markets, and their potential effects on the U.S. economy, merit close and ongoing attention. Finally, many observers have noted a positive relationship between macroeconomic stability and productivity growth. So let me here reaffirm the Federal Reserve's commitment to maintaining price stability, to promoting sustainable growth in output, and to safeguarding the stability of our financial system. I believe that by meeting these objectives, we can do our part to promote an economic environment that encourages the investment and innovation upon which all productivity booms have depended. Conclusion In conclusion, productivity growth--buoyed both by favorable cyclical and by structural factors--has greatly contributed to the recent benign coincidence of rising output, expanding profit margins, subdued unit labor costs, and low inflation. But because the future does not simply replicate the present, uncertainty surrounds the path that productivity will take from here. My sense is that cyclical factors likely contributed to the most recent advances and thus a slowing in productivity growth is likely. Such a cyclical slowing is not a concern in itself, but a simultaneous drop-off in the underlying trend rate of productivity growth could significantly impair our economic prospects. Certain circumstances argue against such an occurrence. History contains several precedents of sustained periods of elevated productivity growth, and, in general, the conditions prevailing during those periods appear to exist today. In addition, the technological underpinnings of the current boom appear secure. However, other forces bear close watching. Stagnation or regression in the movement toward free trade, continued large fiscal deficits, a failure to continue addressing problems in corporate governance, and elevated oil prices could all lessen the weight of conditions that have up to now tilted so favorably toward strong productivity advances.

Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies At the Financial Executives International Chicago Chapter Dinner, Chicago, Illinois July 15, 2004 Business Financial Conditions and Relationships with Bankers I am very pleased to join you for this meeting of the Chicago chapter of Financial Executives International. As many of you know, before my appointment to the Board of Governors, I was quite active in this organization, particularly on the Committee on Corporate Reporting. I also served on the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force. Now, as a member of the Federal Reserve Board and chair of the Board's Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Affairs, I find myself looking at the growth and evolution of the financial system from a slightly different perspective than when I was a chief financial officer. Today I want to focus on the financial health of households and businesses, and on changes in the relationships between businesses and their bankers. First, I would like to briefly share with you my assessment of the economic outlook and discuss in more detail how the evolution of household and business balance sheets in recent years is affecting economic activity. Second, I want to discuss an issue concerning the relationship between corporations and their bankers that has been receiving attention--anti-tying restrictions. I also need to add that I am expressing my own opinions, which are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee. The Economic Outlook As you know, the economic expansion has gained more-solid footing. Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent in the first quarter, building on an even larger increase in the second half of 2003, and it appears to have posted another sizable gain in the second quarter of this year. Although consumer spending has slowed this spring, housing demand has stayed very strong, and business outlays for capital equipment have continued to rebound from their weakness of the past several years. In addition, businesses have stepped up their hiring lately--although the monthly increases have been uneven. Moreover, surveys of corporate executives as well as my business contacts indicate that businesses expect to increase the size of their payrolls in coming months. And with financial conditions still accommodative, I expect that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace in the second half of the year. At the same time, inflation has picked up more rapidly this year than I had expected. The price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy rose 1-1/2 percent over the twelve months ending in May, compared with 3/4 percent over the twelve months ending last December. The step-up in inflation in recent months reflects the ability of more companies to effectively raise prices, but it also has been exacerbated by transitory factors, such as the pass-through of large increases in energy prices and by large apparently one-time adjustments in such items as lodging away from home. The Federal Reserve will need to be alert to signs of higher inflation, and be ready to respond in order to fulfill its commitment to maintain price stability as a necessary condition for maximum sustainable economic growth. Household Financial Conditions Before I turn to the business sector, let me spend a few minutes on the financial condition of the household sector. Some commentators have expressed concern about the rapid growth in household debt in recent years. They fear that households have become overextended and will need to rein in their spending to keep their debt burdens under control. My view is considerably more sanguine. Although there are pockets of financial stress among households, the sector as a whole appears to be in good shape. It is true that households have taken on quite a bit of debt over the past several years. According to the latest available data, total household debt grew at an annual rate of 10 percent between the end of 1999 and the first quarter of 2004; in comparison, after-tax household income increased at a rate of about 5 percent. But looking below the aggregate data, we must understand that the rapid growth in household debt reflects largely a surge in mortgage borrowing, which has been fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates and strong growth in house prices. Indeed, many homeowners have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages, some having done so several times over the past couple of years. Survey data suggest that homeowners took out cash in more than one-half of these "refis," often to pay down loans having higher interest rates. On net, the resulting drop in the average interest rate on household borrowings, combined with the lengthening maturity of their total debt, has damped the monthly payments made by homeowners on their growing stock of outstanding debt. The Federal Reserve publishes two data series that quantify the burden of household obligations. The first series, the debt-service ratio, measures the required payments on mortgage and consumer debt as a share of after-tax personal income. The second series, the financial-obligations ratio, is a broader version of the debt-service ratio that includes required household payments on rent, auto leases, homeowners insurance, and property taxes. Both ratios rose during the 1990s, and both reached a peak in late 2001. Since then, however, they have receded slightly on net, an indication that households, in the aggregate, have been keeping an eye on repayment burdens. Because the debt-service ratio and the financial-obligations ratio are calculated from aggregate data, they do not necessarily indicate whether the typical household is experiencing financial stress. Nonetheless, we have found that changes in either ratio help predict future changes in consumer loan delinquencies. Accordingly, the fact that these ratios have come off their recent peaks is a hopeful sign about household loan performance. Indeed, delinquency rates for a wide range of household loans turned down over the second half of 2003 and edged down again in the first quarter of this year. Another often-cited indicator of household financial conditions is the personal bankruptcy rate. Movements in the bankruptcy rate, to be sure, partly reflect changes in the incidence of financial stress. But the rate has been trending up for more than two decades for a variety of other reasons. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 made bankruptcy a more attractive option for most households by increasing the amount of wealth that households could retain after bankruptcy. Other factors that have likely contributed to the upward trend are a lessening of the social stigma of filing for bankruptcy and growing access to credit in the United States. As lenders have become more sophisticated in their ability to assess the riskiness of borrowers, they have extended loans to households that were previously denied credit. These households are more likely to default on their obligations than the typical borrower, but the increased risk is priced into loan terms. Although the bankruptcy rate remains elevated, it has edged down on balance in recent months, likely because of the pickup in economic growth in the United States since mid-2003. To be sure, mortgage rates and other consumer loan rates have come off the lows reached early this year, and concerns have been heightened about interest payment burdens for households. Although some households will be pressured by the higher rates, I believe the concerns can be overstated. First, most household debt--mortgage and consumer debt combined--carries a fixed interest rate, which slows the adjustment of interest costs to rising rates. Second, although interest rates on some variable-rate loans will rise quickly, the adjustment for a large number of variable-rate loans could be a good deal slower. For example, many adjustable-rate mortgages start off with a fixed rate for several years, providing households with some protection from rising rates. This relatively upbeat assessment of household credit quality seems to be shared by lenders and by investors in securities backed by consumer debt. According to the Federal Reserve's survey of senior loan officers, the number of banks tightening their standards on consumer loans has fallen over the past year. This behavior certainly does not point to much concern about household loan performance. Moreover, one gets an even more positive message from the credit spreads on securities backed by auto loans and credit card receivables. In recent months, the spreads between the yields on these securities and the swap rates of comparable maturities have narrowed across the credit spectrum. Thus far, I have focused on the liability side of the household balance sheet. There have been favorable developments on the asset side as well. Equity prices rallied strongly last year and have held their ground this year, reversing a good portion of the losses sustained over the previous three years. In addition, home prices appreciated sharply during each year from 1997 through 2003. Our most recent reading for the first quarter of this year indicates that home prices continued to rise, but at a more moderate pace. All told, the ratio of household net worth to disposable income--a useful summary of the sector's financial position--recovered last year and currently stands at a level about equal to its average over the past decade. Financial Conditions of Businesses The change in the economy that caught my attention in the second half of 2003 was that business fixed investment had finally begun to strengthen. Capital spending by businesses posted a solid increase in the second half of last year and appears to have advanced again at a robust pace in the first half of this year. Moreover, orders for nondefense capital goods--a key indicator of equipment spending--point to further sizable gains. I view this pickup, along with the improving jobs picture thus far this year, as an indication that business caution about the strength and sustainability of this expansion has waned. Also of special importance is the improvement in the financial health and profitability of the business sector. Indeed, starting last year, many firms found themselves in the unusual position of being able to finance a pickup in spending entirely out of rapidly rising cash flow, and those that needed to turn to external markets generally found the financing environment to be quite accommodative. Four factors have contributed to this improvement in financial conditions: low interest rates, a widespread restructuring of corporate liabilities during the past few years, significant cost-cutting and productivity gains, and a substantial narrowing in market- risk premiums. Even with interest rates expected to rise and profit growth expected to moderate, the financial condition of the business sector should remain strong and able to support continued expansion. I will discuss each factor in turn. First, firms are continuing to benefit from the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Even after the FOMC raised the target funds rate to 1.25 percent a few weeks ago, short-term borrowing costs remain very low. For longer-term debt, the combination of low yields on benchmark Treasury securities and reduced risk spreads has kept borrowing costs quite attractive. Currently, yields on investment-grade corporate debt generally are at the low end of levels of the past several decades, despite having risen on balance by about ï¿½ to one percentage point since late spring of last year. For speculative-grade firms, yields have fallen almost one percentage point as spreads contracted sharply. Second, in response to low long-term rates and to investors' concerns arising from some high-profile, unanticipated meltdowns, firms have greatly strengthened their balance sheets. Many firms have refinanced high-cost debt, a move that has reduced the average interest rate on the debt of nonfinancial corporations by more than 1 percentage point since the end of 2000. Businesses have also substituted long-term debt for short-maturity debt to improve their balance sheet liquidity and to reduce the risk of rolling over funds. In addition, many firms--especially in the most troubled industries--have retired debt through equity offerings and asset sales, while others have used their mounting profits to retire debt. As a result, the growth of nonfinancial corporate debt in the past two-and-a-half years was limited to its slowest pace since the early 1990s. These repairs to balance sheets have also reduced the exposure of many firms to rising interest rates, especially in the near term. In particular, the replacement of short-term debt by long-term bonds means that less debt will have to be rolled over in the near term at higher rates. In addition, because much of the long-term debt has a fixed rate, interest payments typically are unaffected over the life of the bond. Moreover, research by Board staff suggests that firms that rely on floating-rate debt, and for that reason might be more vulnerable to rising rates, have tended to use derivatives in recent years to hedge their exposure to interest rate risk. Thus, for many firms, the effect of rising interest rates will be mitigated and stretched out over time. A third factor contributing to the improvement in financial conditions among businesses is significant belt-tightening by many firms. Over the past few years, the drive to cut costs and boost efficiency has generated rapid productivity gains. Fuller utilization of the capabilities of capital already in place, ongoing improvements in inventory management, and streamlined production processes requiring fewer workers, to name but a few examples of efficiency enhancements, have boosted corporate profitability even when revenue growth was tepid. In the second half of last year, revenue growth picked up, and companies were able to leverage those productivity gains and produce a dramatic recovery in overall corporate profitability. The profits of nonfinancial corporations as a share of sector output surged to reach 12 percent in the first quarter of this year. This share lies above the long-run average of about 10 percent over the past few decades, and well above the cyclical trough of 7 percent in 2001. To be sure, the profit share likely will slip a bit from its high level as the expansion gains steam and businesses are less able to keep a lid on their labor costs. Moreover, because cyclical factors likely contributed to the recent dramatic advances in productivity, we should expect productivity gains to moderate. But these developments and the decline in profit share are to be expected and will not, in my view, lead to a meaningful impairment of the financial health of companies. And finally, risk premiums fell substantially last year as corporate governance scandals receded and investor sentiment turned markedly more positive. The recovery in stock prices reflects this brighter view. Spreads on corporate bonds narrowed appreciably--especially for the riskiest firms--and they now are quite thin, relative to those in several years. Spreads on commercial and industrial loans at commercial banks have diminished over the past year or so, at a time when banks also report that their underwriting standards have moved from restraint to ease. The narrowing of spreads was helped by the balance-sheet improvements that I mentioned a moment ago. Indicators of corporate financial stress, such as delinquency rates on commercial and industrial loans and corporate bonds, have declined markedly, with the latter reaching lows that prevailed in the mid-1990s. Bond-rating downgrades have subsided, and upgrades have picked up to levels normally associated with economic expansion. The narrowing of spreads also reflects the outlook of investors for sustained strength in sales and profit growth. The continuation of efforts to address the accounting and corporate governance scandals of the past few years also serves to increase investors' comfort with providing capital to firms with reasonable premiums for risk. These four factors all suggest that financial conditions are capable of supporting sustained, solid growth of the U.S. economy. The much-improved profitability can help finance expansion directly out of internal funds or indirectly by supporting firms' borrowing capacity. Furthermore, firms will be able to draw on the liquid assets that they have accumulated over the past couple of years. Of course, profit margins are likely to recede from their current high levels as labor and other costs pick up and productivity growth moderates. Even so, given the successful efforts to pare costs, firms are set to benefit from new investment in plant and equipment. Anti-Tying Restrictions on Banks Finally, I want to discuss the nature of anti-tying regulations for financial institutions, an issue that can be very confusing to nonbankers. As innovations create new financial instruments, services, and markets, and as banks expand the scope of the financial services they offer, the process of making business decisions for banks is similar to the process many of you apply in your own business. Financial institutions are trying to build customer loyalty by offering a broader menu of financial services to corporate customers. The concern addressed by anti-tying restrictions is that banks may force customers to take unwanted products to obtain needed services. As a brief background, the special anti-tying statute that applies to banks generally prohibits a bank from conditioning the availability or price of one product on a requirement that the customer also obtain another product that is not a traditional bank product from the bank or an affiliate of the bank. For example, a bank may not inform a customer that the bank will provide the customer a loan only if the customer engages the bank's securities affiliate for an underwriting or obtains some other product or service that is not a traditional bank product from the bank or an affiliate. The words "that is not a traditional bank product" are important. Not all tying arrangements are illegal ties. The statute and the Board's regulations expressly permit a bank to condition the availability or price of a product or service on a requirement that the customer also obtain one or more traditional bank products from the bank or an affiliate. A traditional bank product generally is defined as any "loan, discount, deposit, or trust service," and the Board's proposed interpretation provides guidance on what types of products fall within the scope of these terms. In light of these complexities, the Board has published and sought public comment on an interpretation of the anti-tying statute and related supervisory guidance. The proposed interpretation was published to help banking organizations and corporate customers clarify permissible practices under this complex statute in today's financial services environment. Importantly, the interpretation proposes guidelines that could be followed when a bank seeks to engage in traditional "relationship banking," that is, serving customers on the basis of the profitability of the overall customer relationship. The guidance includes the establishment of some regulatory "safe harbors." The proposed guidance communicates our expectations as to the types of policies, procedures, internal controls, and training programs that should help banks comply with the anti-tying restrictions. It also emphasizes the importance of the compliance and internal audit functions in ensuring compliance with the law and regulations. The Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have long required that banking organizations establish and maintain policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the anti-tying restrictions, and the agencies monitor these policies and procedures through the supervisory process. Admittedly, at times it can be difficult to determine whether a violation of the anti-tying statute has occurred. As I mentioned, some forms of tying by banks are expressly permitted, and the statute does not apply to tying arrangements imposed by the nonbank affiliates of a bank. Moreover, divining whether a bank imposed a prohibited tie often requires a close review of the facts and circumstances associated with the particular transaction. A prohibited tie, for example, may be conveyed orally and not memorialized in transaction documentation. Our supervisory reviews indicate that banks generally understand and have implemented systems to ensure compliance with the anti-tying provisions to which they are subject. In addition, although we have encouraged customers that believe they have been the subject of an illegal tie to come forward, we have received few complaints from bank customers. Moreover, few customers have sought to challenge their banks directly, although they are granted a private right of action under the statute and may obtain treble damages if successful. A 2003 General Accounting Office report on bank tying practices found that the available evidence did not substantiate claims of illegal tying by banks, but it did note that borrowers were reluctant to file formal complaints. The GAO recommended that the Board consider taking additional steps to enforce compliance with the anti-tying provisions. Our proposed interpretation and guidance is intended to help banks understand this rather complex compliance area. I should mention that we also received a comment letter on the proposed interpretation from the Department of Justice. This letter, which is available on the department web site, expresses concern that the bank anti-tying statute itself may suppress competition and harm consumers, especially as it is applied to large customers. The department has recommended that the Board interpret the bank anti-tying statute in a manner similar to the federal antitrust laws. Unlike the general antitrust laws, the courts historically have found that the anti-tying statute applicable to banks generally does not require a showing of market power to support a violation. Alternatively, the department has recommended that the Board exercise its statutory authority to exempt large, corporate customers from the reach of the bank anti-tying statute. These are all issues the Board will have to carefully consider as we move toward finalizing the interpretation and guidance in this area. Conclusion In conclusion, the economic expansion is now broad based, and the financial strength of businesses should help provide the foundation for continued growth in the months ahead. The Financial Executives International has contributed to the financial strength of businesses today by providing corporate financial officers with information on evolutions in best business practices and processes and by serving as an effective forum for dialogue on emerging issues in finance and governance. I encourage you, as senior officers of your firms, to keep this discussion alive within your firms. When businesses have a strong focus on corporate ethics, a robust internal control culture, and transparent disclosure, financial markets can provide capital efficiently.

Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies At the Risk Management Association and Consumer Bankers Association Retail Risk Conference, Chicago, Illinois July 16, 2004 Using Enterprise-wide Risk Management to Effectively Execute Business Strategies I want to thank both the Consumer Bankers Association and RMA--The Risk Management Association--for inviting me to speak at this conference. I am pleased that these two organizations support an agenda that recognizes the critical role risk management now plays in successful implementation of business strategies. Today, I would like to talk about some of the components of successful risk management, and also describe how risk management can support more effective implementation of business strategies. The Evolution of Enterprise-wide Market Risk Management Successful bankers have always practiced effective risk management, but only over the last twenty-five years has risk management evolved into a discipline in its own right. If we look at the three major types of risk in financial institutions--market, credit, and operations--we can trace the progression of risk-management techniques in each, with market risk leading the way. When Regulation Q was lifted in 1978, the Federal Reserve no longer established the rate paid on non-demand deposit accounts. Bankers were then able to set the rate of interest paid on core deposits based on their own competitive conditions. The following year, the Federal Reserve began to aggressively fight the seriously high rate of inflation that was occurring. As a result, short-term interest rates rose to unusually high levels. Bankers who were used to taking fixed-rate deposits under Reg Q and making fixed-rate term loans, found the cost of their deposits rising with the market. Financial institutions found that, to meet market interest rates, they were paying higher rates of interest on deposits than they were receiving on loans. As a banker in 1980, I went through that period when the popular new six-month CDs that were booked in March at annualized interest rates of around 15 percent, were funding loans at a negative carry when the prime rate fell to 11 percent by August. The roller coaster continued when lower CD rates in the second half of 1980 were funding loans at a prime rate of over 20 percent by January 1981. One of the first challenges bankers faced in this environment was that no one had the information systems needed to manage the entire balance sheet rate sensitivity. Not only were asset/liability models nonexistent, but data on loan and deposit maturities and repricing were also not available from standard loan and deposit computer application systems. So in the early 1980s, asset/liability models were developed, taking advantage of the newly emerging technology of computers and software. Further, the management committees responsible for interest rate risk changed. Instead of committees which included only management from the funding desk and investment portfolio management, a new group was created--the Asset/Liability Committee. This committee included not only the old finance committee members and new ALCO staff but, most important, it added business-line managers responsible for major corporate and retail banking activities. For the first time, pricing loans and deposits moved from the silo of business line management into recognition that the enterprise as a whole had to coordinate balance sheet usage in order to maintain the net interest margin around a targeted level. In those days, net interest income was about 80 percent of bank revenue, and so its consistent growth was important to meeting earnings targets. Today when one listens to the discussion at ALCO meetings, you can hear managers from different business lines discuss priorities for loan growth use of the balance sheet and markets where competitive tactics call for relatively higher rates to be paid on deposits. Even CEOs now understand mortgage prepayment risk and can talk knowledgably to investors about the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates. While this enterprise-wide approach to market risk evolved at varying paces in different depository institutions, by the latter part of the 1980s all of the basic elements were in place. In the 1990s, the process had matured and is now widely recognized as a critical element in both management and board governance processes. What has helped this discipline emerge is not only more sophisticated asset/liability models, but also the rapid innovation in financial instruments. As institutions focused their attention on problem areas, new methods and financial instruments were created to mitigate the risks. When the savings and loan institutions failed in the 1980s, partly as a result of deposit costs above the rates received on term loans, the industry turned to new securitization techniques to pool mortgages and remove the interest rate risk from balance sheets. Slower deposit growth in the 1990s, due to the rapid growth of mutual and money market funds, supported the attractiveness of securitizing other assets, and soon loans--credit cards, auto loans, home equity loans, etc.--were securitized without the benefit of government-sponsored agencies. But interest rate risk remains a critical issue in executing successful business-line strategies. As intermediaries, customers always want to go long and short in direct opposition to the interest of the banking enterprise as a whole. Borrowers want to lock in longer-term fixed-rate loans when they perceive rates are at their lows, and they want to hold longer-term fixed-rate CDs when they think interest rates have peaked. Again, innovations have dramatically changed the way institutions mitigate and manage interest rate risk. Interest rate derivatives, structured investment securities, and callable debt have allowed financial institutions to better meet customer demands while managing the liquidity and interest rate risk exposures those relationships entail. Interest rate risk management is thus a great example of how an enterprise-wide approach can customize products to better serve customers, set prices to reflect risk exposures and attain profit targets, and ensure that corporate earnings contributions are met. Enterprise-wide market-risk management therefore is a value-added activity, which has become widely accepted as a critical element of the governance and strategic processes at financial institutions. The evolution of a portfolio approach to loan credit risk management followed a path similar to asset/liability management that began in the late 1980s in the aftermath of serious credit-quality deterioration. Models and data bases have since become more sophisticated, and loan review committees have evolved into committees that look at portfolio risk. As a result, loans are priced to better reflect their varying levels of risk, loans are syndicated and securitized to mitigate lenders' risk, and credit derivatives have been created to limit credit risk exposures that are retained. Operations risk is the risk that has most recently risen to management and regulatory attention--not because it has previously been unimportant, but because it has been so difficult to measure. At this time, we are still in the early stages of measuring this risk, and the challenges in gathering the relevant data and developing the models are still great. Proposals recently issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that would require internationally active banks to maintain regulatory capital for operational risk has spurred industry efforts to quantify the risk. Through such efforts, I expect we will see significant progress here, too, as additional resources are brought to the task. In the process, the industry will have made great progress in addressing each of what are arguably the three greatest risk to banks--market, credit, and operational risk--and they will have done so quantitatively and systematically through an integrated-risk, enterprise-wide framework. Strategic Planning The example I just presented of how effective Asset/Liability Management Committees and processes can support business-line strategies as well as governance, is intended to illustrate that effective enterprise-wide risk-management processes are not built just to "comply" with banking regulations or Sarbanes-Oxley requirements. Rather, these processes can add value when they become an integral part of both strategic and tactical business-decision processes. Corporate strategies often focus on the "most likely" future scenario and the benefits of a strategic initiative. A sound governance, risk management, and internal control environment starts by stretching the strategic planning exercise to consider alternative outcomes. That is, while the strategy is being developed, management and the board should consider a number of questions: What are the major risks this plan exposes the company to? How much risk exposure are we willing to accept? What are the mitigating controls that need to be in place to effectively limit these risks? How will we know if these controls are working effectively? In other words, by considering risks as part of the planning process, controls can be built into the process design, the costs of errors and rework in the initial rollout can be reduced, and the ongoing initiative can be more successful because monitoring processes can signal when activities and results are missing their intended goals, so that corrective actions can be initiated more promptly. We all are aware of companies in various industries that have successfully presented their strategic vision to investors but later stumble because the execution of that strategy did not meet expectations. While shortfalls can occur for many reasons, one of the more common causes is that the strategy itself was focused too much on market and financial results, without adequate attention to the infrastructure necessary to support and sustain the implementation. Over the years, corporate managers have learned that focusing on better process management and quality can enhance financial returns and customer satisfaction. They have learned that correcting errors, downtime in critical systems, and relying on undertrained staff all create higher costs and lost revenue opportunities. I challenge you to consider the corporate governance structure appropriate to your bank's unique business strategy and scale as an important investment, and to consider returns on that investment in terms of the avoidance of the costs of poor internal controls and customer dissatisfaction. As you know, once an organization gets lax in its approach to internal controls, problems tend to follow. Many of you can recall the time and attention management devoted to section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA 112) when management reports and auditor attestations were first required in the early 1990s. Then the process became routine, stale to the changes in the way the business was being run, delegated to lower levels of management, and even assigned solely to the internal audit staff. When line management at all levels is not engaged in regular assessments of changing risk exposures and evaluations of the effectiveness of mitigating controls, breaks in internal controls are more likely to occur. Unfortunately, some banks that have allowed FDICIA 112 internal control processes to be looked at as a compliance burden are now having to readjust the culture of their organizations to comply with the similar provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley 404 and the new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Standard 2. Trying to change the culture again is taking an exceptional amount of senior management and director time--time that is taken away from building the business. The challenge, therefore, is to ensure that risk management and internal control cultures are maintained at the appropriate priority level in your organization, and consistency will help you deal with the risks that you will face in the coming years. Enterprise-wide Risk Management Enterprise-wide risk management looks within and across business lines and activities of the organization as a whole to consider how one area of the firm may affect the risks of other business lines and the enterprise as a whole. This approach is in marked contrast with the silo approach to risk management, which considers the risks of activities or business lines in isolation, without considering how those risks interrelate and affect other business lines. While individual business lines or activities should continue to enhance their own risk-management practices, as organizations gain in complexity it is important to provide the critical oversight that can come only from an enterprise-wide risk-management approach. Why is an enterprise-wide compliance program so important? Board members of various financial services companies involved in recent scandals have made similar public comments that identified as one of the causes of their firm's compliance breakdowns, the bifurcation of compliance responsibilities within the firm. That is, no one had the 25,000-foot view of what was happening across the organization, and this led to internal control shortcomings that were not identified and to opportunities for employees to take unfair advantage of other market participants. Moreover, the compliance with business-line risk-management and internal control policies did not have the status and perceived importance it should have had. One best practice is that exceptions approved within the business line should become transparent to the enterprise's risk-management staff, executive management, and board of directors. That is, regular reviews of exception approvals by type and frequency can provide insight into the effectiveness of policies and mitigating controls. Likewise, there should be a process for reporting control failures. This addition helps to ensure that the board, the group that is ultimately responsible for risk management, can assess the quality and robustness of risk management across the organization. Viewing risk management across the organization's different functions minimizes the possibility of overlooking legal and reputational risks. A silo view of risk management may allow gaps in control to persist, with no one assuming responsibility for a risk, or may allow conflicting internal controls to develop. One of the common themes running through many of the well-known breakdowns in internal controls over the last two years is lack of attention to conflicts of interest. Rewarding officers for booking business without regard for violations of internal controls in other functional areas has created significant reputational, regulatory, and legal risk for some organizations. An enterprise-wide approach to risk management does not replace, but rather builds on the practices of individual business lines. Indeed, it is very important to retain business-line functions because they are staffed by individuals who understand the activities being conducted and know where control breakdowns have occurred in the past. For example, the risk-management function for consumer credit requires staff with detailed understanding of the changes in risk models, marketing campaigns, lending officer training, collections effectiveness, etc. The enterprise-wide approach supplements this business-line-specific view with a big-picture approach at the corporate level that encompasses and has access to all lines of business and operational areas. It aggregates the various business-line reviews in assessing the robustness and adequacy of enterprise-wide risk management, and it ensures that significant issues are brought to the attention of senior global compliance officers as appropriate. Several elements are essential to the successful implementation of enterprise-wide risk management. One is clearly articulated risk-management goals that provide a foundation for the enterprise-wide risk-management program and for related training and communication. A second is a common risk language, which is critical because it enables individuals throughout the organization to conduct meaningful cross-functional discussions about risk. A third element essential to the implementation of successful enterprise-wide risk management is that individuals clearly understand their roles in the risk-assessment and risk-management framework. In today's environment, I urge all organizations to consider embracing this discipline. Indeed, the Federal Reserve is currently considering how to better integrate enterprise-wide risk management into its management processes. Introduction of New Activities An enterprise-wide risk-management program should also be dynamic, constantly assessing changing risks when new business lines or activities are added or existing activities are altered. Continuing reassessment of risks and controls and communication with the business lines is necessary to avoid an internal control environment that is operating on autopilot and does not proactively respond to change in the organization. Many of the organizations that have seen their reputations tarnished in the past few years have simply neglected to consider emerging conflicts of interest when adding new products and lines of business. It is important to make sure that appropriate firewalls and mitigating controls are in place before the product or activity begins. The enterprise-wide compliance function should look at what is being reported to the board, the audit committee, and senior management about new or changed processes, procedures, and controls. In evaluating risks, managers need to consider both current and planned or anticipated operational and market changes and identify the risks arising from those changes. Once risks have been identified comprehensively and their potential impact on the organization evaluated, management must determine the effectiveness of existing controls and develop and implement additional appropriate mitigating controls where needed. The robustness and effectiveness of these controls must be evaluated independently, soon after the control structure is established, so that any shortcomings can be identified promptly and corrected. Risk assessments initiated early in the planning process can give the firm time to implement mitigating controls and conduct a validation of the quality of those controls before launching the product. Strong internal controls and governance require that these assessments be done by an independent group. One of the weaknesses that we have seen is that management delegates both the development and the assessment of the internal control structure to the same risk-management, internal audit, compliance, or legal division. Instead, it is important to emphasize that line management has the responsibility for identifying risks and ensuring that the mitigating controls are effective, and that the assessments should be done by a group independent of that line organization. The Role of the New-Product Approval Process Enterprise-wide risk management is an important part of the new-product approval process, along with other relevant parties, including credit risk, market risk, operations, accounting, legal, audit, and senior line management. New products include products or services being offered to, or activities being conducted for the first time in, a new market or to a new category of customers or counterparties. For example, a product traditionally marketed to middle-income customers that is being rolled out to low- or moderate-income customers generally should be reviewed as a new product. In addition, significant modifications to products, services, and activities or their pricing warrant review as a new product. Even small changes in the terms of products or the scope of services or activities can greatly alter their risk profiles and justify review as a new product. When in doubt about whether a product, service, or activity warrants review as a new product, financial firms should err on the side of conservatism and route the proposal through the new-product approval process. Cutting short a new-product review because of a rush to deliver a new product to market, or because of performance pressures, increases the potential for serious risk exposures and losses. Let me describe the evolution of two traditional products that came to regulators' attention because the changing risk exposures in the products were not supported by appropriate changes in the internal control and risk-management infrastructure. The first is credit cards, which have long been a profitable service offered by many financial institutions. In the last several years, however, credit cards have been marketed to higher-credit-risk customers who traditionally would not have qualified for this product. To compensate for higher risks, the revenue stream from these subprime credit cards is very different from those of traditional credit cards. Despite the differences in risk profiles and revenue streams, targeted reviews of subprime credit card lending by regulators determined that internal controls and risk-management information had not been adapted to monitor these new products at some institutions. Because so much of the revenue from these products takes the form of up-front, monthly, and late fees, rapid growth in the number of accounts leads to billing of fees ahead of charge-offs that occur later in the customer relationship. Some banks were recording fee income as revenue when it was billed, and they had no information system to determine what share of those fees would eventually be collected. As the number of accounts was growing, the write-off of uncollectible fees was not transparent in the aggregate fee income that was being recorded. Once organizations tracked write-offs of uncollectible fees and tied them with credit scores of customers and aging of accounts, a portion of fees billed was reserved against losses. Further, the rapid growth of credit card balances outstanding also masked the deteriorating credit quality of some portfolios. When these organizations began to track charge-offs by age of account, six-month charge-off rates of subprime portfolios were found to exceed those of prime credit cards by factors of several fold. When management and boards looked at this new information, they saw a very different picture of the profitability of this product. Some banks realized that as soon as growth of accounts slowed, the front-ending of income would be overcome by the back- ending of charge-offs. They realized that the product as structured was in fact reducing shareholder value, and took appropriate actions. The second product evolution I want to use as an example of risk management is "bounced check protection." Bankers have always honored the occasional check written by a good customer that was presented with insufficient funds. But in the last couple of years, vendors have been marketing programs to grow fee income by promoting the availability of this balance-protection service. Consumers do benefit when banks cover checks, since they do not incur returned- check charges from the merchant to whom they wrote the check, not to mention the embarrassment of bouncing a check. But again, some bankers did not stop to consider how this new service was changing the risk profile of the service and effectively assess the risk and reward. Here is where an enterprise-wide approach to product introduction can help. When checks are covered for customers, the bank is effectively taking on the risk that those customers may never bring their accounts current. Like revenue from subprime credit cards, if the fees for overdrafts are booked as income when billed to the account, it may be some time before the overdraft becomes large enough to call attention to the need for a charge-off. If credit risk officers were involved in the review of this new product, they may be more likely to realize that information systems should be in place to track the frequent users of this service and write a policy that called for timely recognition of charge-offs. In fact, it could identify customers in temporary financial duress who might be candidates for loan products, in which case the bank could retain good long-term customers and appropriately structure the loan to reflect the risk, and the customers could obtain the needed credit at an all-in cost below what they would incur by using their checking accounts inappropriately. The Federal Reserve, along with the other regulators, has out for comment some guidance on this product, and I do not want to prejudge the results of that review. So, in the meantime I turn your attention to guidelines prepared by the American Bankers Association, which provide some useful information. Conclusion What I have tried to do this morning is to challenge all of you to think about how you can work together to improve the execution of your banks' strategic plans. Consumer banking managers should realize that they can look to an effective enterprise-wide risk-management process as a way to better understand the risk exposure in their products and customer groups. It can help identify the important mitigating controls that should be in place to keep risk exposures at the level necessary to achieve profitability targets. And by working with managers who spend their time thinking about different types of risks, consumer bankers can reduce unintended customer service errors, compliance breakdowns, and difficult product rollouts. For the risk managers at this conference, I hope the message you have heard is that you should be actively engaged with managers throughout the organization, talking about the merits of a consistent, sound enterprise-wide risk management culture. Demonstrate to managers that the risk-management process will help them better understand the inherent risks of their activities so they can more effectively mitigate them and achieve their profit goals.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced its approval of the application under the Bank Holding Company Act by LBT Bancshares, Inc., Litchfield, Illinois, to acquire control of Security Bancshares, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Security National Bank, both in Witt, Illinois. Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action.
Joint Press Release Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Thrift Supervision For Immediate Release July 20, 2004 Agencies Issue Final Rule on Capital Requirements for Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Programs The federal banking and thrift regulatory agencies today issued a amending their risk-based capital standards. The rule permits sponsoring banks, bank holding companies, and thrifts (banking organizations) to continue to exclude from their risk-weighted asset base for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) program assets that are consolidated onto sponsoring banking organizations' balance sheets as a result of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as revised (FIN 46-R). This provision of the final rule will make permanent an existing interim final rule. The final rule also requires banking organizations to hold risk-based capital against eligible ABCP liquidity facilities with an original maturity of one year or less that provide liquidity support to ABCP by imposing a 10 percent credit conversion factor on such facilities. Eligible ABCP liquidity facilities with an original maturity exceeding one year remain subject to the current 50 percent credit conversion factor. Ineligible liquidity facilities are treated as direct credit substitutes or recourse obligations and are subject to a 100 percent credit conversion factor. The resulting credit equivalent amount is then risk weighted according to the underlying assets, after consideration of any collateral, guarantees, or external ratings, if applicable. All liquidity facilities that provide liquidity support to ABCP will be treated as eligible liquidity facilities for a one-year transition period. The rule, which will be published shortly in the Federal Register, will become effective on September 30, 2004. The Federal Register notice is attached.

Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. At The Exchequer Club of Washington Luncheon, Washington, D.C. July 21, 2004 A Retrospective on Business-Cycle Recoveries: Are "Jobless" Recoveries the New Norm? It is an honor for me to address the Exchequer Club of Washington, D.C. Your purpose of providing a frank and open exchange of information and opinion on national policy is indeed laudable. With business investment bouncing back and consumption continuing to grow, real gross domestic product seems to have been advancing at approximately a 4 percent annual pace over the first half of the year. In addition, both the labor market and the manufacturing sector, two areas that had been lagging through most of the recovery, appear to have finally started to advance. Private payroll employment has risen a little more than 200,000 per month, on average, since the end of last year, and although last month's increase of 117,000 was disappointing, there is little indication that the labor market's progress is stalling. The same may be said of the manufacturing sector, in which employment, before last month's decline, had posted three consecutive months of solid gains, and production advanced strongly again in the second quarter. Of course, as some recent data remind us, there are always sizable uncertainties regarding both the likely rate of growth of economic activity and the trajectory of inflation. That said, the recovery from the 2001 recession appears to be firmly on track. Accordingly, this seems to be a good time to take stock of what we should learn from recent business-cycle experience. In particular, we have experienced two "jobless" recoveries. Are these the new norm? The question is of more than academic interest. A change in business-cycle dynamics might dictate important changes in the conduct of monetary policy. As usual, the remarks I make today represent my own views, which are not necessarily shared by other members of the Board of Governors or of the Federal Open Market Committee. Distinctive Features of the Current Recovery A truism among students of business cycles is that no two cycles are ever exactly the same, and the current recovery has been unusual in several respects. For some time after the recovery began, businesses were reluctant to increase expenditures for fixed capital and to re-stock inventories. Business fixed investment usually jumps shortly after a business-cycle trough, as firms that held back during the recession rush to put new equipment in place to replace aging equipment and to meet the expected surge in demand. For example, in the year-and-a-half after each of the six troughs between 1958 and 1982, business fixed investment rose at an average annual rate of 7-1/2 percent. But in the year-and-a-half after the trough of the 2001 recession, firms actually decreased investment at an annual rate of 3/4 percent; this decline occurred in addition to the sharp fall in capital spending (relative to GDP) that took place during the recession. Likewise, investment in business inventories, which had subtracted more than 1 percentage point from real GDP growth, on average, during the six quarters leading up to the trough, failed to snap back in its usual fashion. Instead, the inventory stock was little changed, on balance, in the first two years of the recovery. Some of this unusual behavior probably reflects the ability of modern firms to function with leaner inventories, but firms also appear to have been acting more cautiously. A second distinctive element of this recovery involved households. The household sector remained a relatively bright spot in the economy in 2001; increases in spending for consumption goods and housing prevented the downturn in investment from generating a deeper recession. Household spending has continued to rise at a solid pace during the recovery. However, because this recession included neither the typical sharp decline in purchases of durable goods nor the usual deceleration in outlays for other types of personal consumption, we have not seen the sharp increases in these areas that often follow a trough. Indeed, real consumer spending actually rose at a greater rate during the recession than it did over the first year of the recovery. Similarly, real residential investment continued to expand during the recession, and although the rate of growth was relatively subdued, it bore no resemblance to the sharp declines that characterized every previous recession in the post-World War II period; the acceleration since the upturn began has been relatively subdued as well. However, the most noted feature of the current recovery is that employment has been below par--another so-called jobless recovery. Private payroll employment, and the workweek on net, continued to fall for two years from the trough of the recession in late 2001. Private employment last month remained well below its level when the recession began, and only in May had it climbed above its level when the recession ended. This situation contrasts sharply with the beginning of most postwar recoveries (although, as I will discuss later, not with the one in the early 1990s), when employment surged. Similarly, with employment growth until recently having been wanting, the unemployment rate peaked more than a year and a half after the recession ended and has not yet fallen below its level at the time designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the economic trough. And quite possibly the unemployment rate has been understating the amount of slack in the labor market because labor-force participation has been unusually weak, perhaps reflecting an assessment on the part of many households that job availability would be poor for those actually in the labor market. The output growth that largely defines the recovery resulted from impressive growth in labor productivity. During the two years of falling employment, productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose about 5 percent per year. Part of this spectacular performance is typical. One expects productivity to rise quickly during the early stages of a recovery; as utilization rates rise, companies find more for their workers to do. Part of the growth of labor productivity may have to do with unusual, and transitory, hesitation on the part of businesses to hire, a topic to which I will return. Happily, however, the recent increases appear to have an important structural component as well. Whereas most recessions since World War II had no productivity growth or had outright declines, productivity during this past recession rose at a rate of more than 2 percent. And this growth was a continuation of the rapid gains that characterized the latter half of the 1990s. The favorable performance of productivity likely is related to another unusual feature of this recovery: the behavior of prices. Productivity growth in the years leading up to the business-cycle peak in early 2001 was one factor that contributed to keeping inflation low. Core prices for personal consumption expenditures advanced at an average annual rate of less than 2 percent over the two years preceding the peak--despite unemployment rates down around 4 percent. Moreover, prices decelerated during the recovery. At this time last year we observed core PCE inflation in the vicinity of 1 percent. In fact, inflation was so low, especially once known biases in the price indexes are taken into account, that for several months the FOMC was concerned more about the possibility of "inflation becoming undesirably low" than about the risk of a rise in inflation. These low rates of inflation coming into the recession and continuing into the recovery were one reason why the Federal Reserve responded so aggressively to the downturn and why we maintained a historically low federal funds rate so long after the trough. Just how aggressive was this response, relative to history? In general, comparing monetary policy responses across cyclical episodes is difficult. The natural indicator to look at, the federal funds rate, is measured in nominal terms, so that large movements in the rate of inflation can mask the underlying stance of policy. Moreover, an easing of a certain size might be considered relatively more or less aggressive depending on the magnitude and nature of the shocks hitting the economy. Still, in the current cycle, the Fed began lowering the federal funds rate two months before the official cyclical peak (as identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research) and lowered rates 450 basis points over the first year of the easing and 100 basis points over the second year. Although this total decline of 550 basis points was not the largest on record, it was large and quite early. And given the relatively small decline in output in 2001, one can easily argue that this monetary policy response was unusually aggressive. Similarities with the Recovery in the Early 1990s In the period since World War II, several of the earlier recoveries had one or two of these features in common with the most recent period. For example, the rebound in residential investment fell short of the typical burst in 1961, the unemployment rate remained stubbornly high in 1971, and inventory investment remained low in 1975. But no previous recovery looked quite like this one. However, the recovery following the 1990 recession stands out as similar to the current episode in several important respects. First, employment rose at a glacial pace for a year and a half after the trough in early 1991, and the unemployment rate continued to rise. Second, the business sector continued for a full year to reduce spending on fixed investment and to refrain from accumulating significant amounts of inventories. Third, household spending did not accelerate rapidly after the 1990 recession. Instead, both consumption expenditures and residential investment posted among the most-subdued recoveries in the past fifty years. One should note, however, that household expenditures did fall markedly during the 1990 recession, unlike the most recent episode. Figuring out why these two recoveries were atypically hesitant and jobless is not an easy task. Let me consider several possible explanations. One explanation for the similarity of the two most recent recoveries may be that both of these lukewarm recoveries followed shallow recessions. The shallowness of the downturns is consistent with the general moderation of the volatility of U.S. economic activity in the past twenty years, which many observers have noted. The 2001 decline in total output--only 1/2 percent spread over the first three quarters of the year--was so small that the level of real GDP exceeded its pre-recession peak by the first quarter of 2002. Similarly, real GDP fell only 1-1/4 percent in the 1990 recession. One could argue that, because little ground was lost during the recessions, little ground was available to be regained in the recovery phase. However, the recession of 1969-70 was not any deeper, yet investment spending and payroll employment growth shot up immediately after the trough. Accordingly, a shallow recession does not appear to guarantee a shallow recovery. A second possibility is that the labor market has changed in a way that makes jobless recoveries the new norm. For example, perhaps the pace of structural change in the demand for labor has increased over time. One could point, say, to a smaller proportion of temporary layoffs among job losers during the past two episodes as an indication that re-employment is now more likely to require changing employers than it was in earlier times. And the common perception is that workers are now more likely to have to change industries or occupations to remain employed. From a firm's perspective, hiring new workers for different jobs rather than recalling former workers to their previous jobs is likely to involve greater up-front costs in terms of recruitment and training, and the shifts in demand that created the need for new workers mean that hiring is associated with new capital as well. In this case, firms may require greater confidence in the durability of demand for their products to be willing to incur the costs involved in hiring. Many analysts argue, however, that the labor market has become more flexible since workers have become less attached to individual firms, jobs have become more project-oriented, wage setting has become less rigid, and the use of temporary help and other "contingent" work arrangements has become more prevalent. These developments reduce the up-front costs and commitments involved in hiring and should make firms more willing to hire as demand for their products revives. Therefore, the case for structural change in the labor market as the cause of the jobless recoveries is far from conclusive. It is tempting to interpret the two recent recoveries as reflecting a fundamental shift in the behavior of the economy or the labor market over the business cycle. Indeed, the two explanations for slow economic recoveries that I have discussed--shallower recessions and structural change in the labor market--likely contain some elements of the truth. However, the structure of the economy is always in flux to some extent, and I think it probable that experiencing two hesitant recoveries in a row was largely a matter of coincidence. In each case, idiosyncratic factors that were specific to each episode combined in a way that inhibited the economic expansion in important sectors when other fundamentals would have favored a more typical cyclical upturn. I will discuss these factors now. Idiosyncratic Factors Inhibiting Recoveries The strength of a recovery may be related to the nature of the shocks that led the economy into recession. In contrast to earlier recessions, which were often sparked by tightening monetary policy, the 1990 recession was triggered by a pullback in aggregate demand not induced by monetary policy. In 1990, oil prices increased and consumer confidence dropped sharply; both occurrences were at least partly related to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In response, consumer spending dropped sharply. Although the Federal Reserve had tightened policy in the late 1980s to restrain price pressures, it was loosening again by mid-1989. Similarly, before the 2001 downturn, the Federal Reserve was not aggressively tightening. Rather, the 2001 recession seems to have been kicked off by unreasonable expectations about the profitability of investment in technology related to the Internet. One manifestation of these overly optimistic expectations was that the nominal share of high-tech investment in overall equipment and software spending rose from about 35 percent in the mid-1990s to almost 45 percent by the end of 2000. By the time more-sober assessments of the profitability of the high-tech sector came to the fore, huge sums of money had been sunk into capital equipment and software and into new enterprises. A serious reconsideration of these expenditures contributed to a sharp retrenchment of business investment. Although the causes of these two most recent recessions were clearly different, they were similar along one important dimension: Both were related to changes in the subjective appraisals by persons and businesses of fundamental economic prospects, and to heightened uncertainty about those prospects. In real time, it is extraordinarily difficult to determine the likely severity and duration of these types of shocks. Using monetary policy to counter a shock of this nature is not as straightforward as reversing an earlier tightening. In retrospect, it is clear that during the two most recent recoveries these subjective views improved and uncertainty abated only slowly. Therefore, the first idiosyncratic reason why these recoveries were tepid was likely that the preceding recessions were caused by shocks that proved to have longer-lasting effects and that were more difficult to counteract than expected. In the wake of the two recent downturns, further idiosyncratic shocks hit the economy, exacerbating the sluggishness of the recoveries. In the early 1990s, the collapse of savings and loan institutions and the need to repair the capital structure of the banking industry led to a period in which the flow of credit to businesses was impaired--the so-called credit crunch. Facing limited access to credit, businesses--especially small businesses--curtailed hiring and capital expenditures. After the trough in 2001, the banking industry was much sounder. However, the economy was still adjusting to the excess capital spending from the late 1990s. Equipment takes years to depreciate; so when firms realized that they had purchased more than they needed, they did not feel compelled to raise their level of capital expenditures again for quite some time. Indeed, this "overhang" of capital has likely contributed to the impressive growth in productivity over the past few years, as businesses have made more and better use of the high-tech equipment they had previously installed but underexploited. Besides the boom-bust cycle in capital spending, the U.S. economy confronted the terrorist attacks of 2001, the corporate governance scandals of 2002, and the 2003 war in Iraq. Clearly, such an uncertain and risky environment, which led many firms to question the durability and strength of the recovery, encouraged neither the creation of new jobs nor the expansion of capacity. This discussion of the post-recession shocks that damped the pace of the most recent two recoveries does not imply that similar obstacles were absent in earlier recoveries. The early stages of previous recoveries also contained events that legitimately raised concerns about the vitality and viability of the upturns. Indeed, at the beginning of each recovery for at least the past fifty years, some observers expressed concern that various factors might result in a tepid recovery. In 1982, for instance, as the United States emerged from recession, growth in the rest of the world was moribund, and the international financial system was considered fragile. Other concerns were that the length of the recession would make consumers and businesses cautious and that changes in the economy would lead to prolonged structural unemployment. In 1975, concerns were that the recovery would be weak because businesses were still adjusting to higher oil prices and pollution regulations and because several large cities (most famously New York) were having serious financial troubles. In addition, the housing industry was threatened by a large inventory of unsold homes as well as difficulties obtaining financing after the collapse of the market for real estate investment trusts. Even after the relatively mild recession of 1969-70, a speculative crisis in foreign exchange markets and apprehensions on the part of businesses about just-enacted wage and price controls and environmental regulations fueled some pessimism about the prospects for a quick recovery. Geopolitical tensions, which may seem like a distinctive feature of the past two business cycles, also weighed on analysts' minds following the cyclical troughs in 1961 and 1958. The 1961-62 recovery coincided with the building of the Berlin Wall, the resumption of nuclear weapons testing in the Soviet Union, and other incidents that heightened Cold War tensions in various parts of the world. The 1958-59 recovery coincided with a crisis in the Middle East that involved the entry of U.S. troops into Lebanon as well as a crisis in the market for Treasury securities that kept Fed observers, at least, on the edges of their seats. Thus, adverse conditions and events were certainly not confined to the two most recent recoveries. In the earlier cases I have just noted, however, these headwinds did not, in the event, result in sluggish recoveries. Given the disparate nature of the shocks across these episodes, one cannot say with certainty why the particular combinations of factors in the most recent cases led to a different outcome. The upshot for policy, unfortunately, is that clearly identifying both the possible obstacles to a recovery and the ramifications of those obstacles is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Conclusion In summary, delayed and sluggish improvements in the labor market, business equipment investment, and inventory accumulation mark the two most recent recoveries as different from other recoveries after World War II. Why these most recent two recoveries have been atypically hesitant and jobless is unclear. As I have discussed, the shallowness of the recessions and the possible structural changes in the labor market may have played some role. However, I think that important weight should be given to idiosyncratic features such as the causes of the preceding recessions and the occurrence of additional shocks after the recessions ended that exacerbated the economy's problems. This view implies that monetary policymaking probably does not need to be altered in a systematic way to accommodate a new sort of business-cycle dynamics. On the contrary, the fact that the two most recent recoveries have involved slow job growth in their initial stages may best be attributed to chance rather than a new structure of the economy. Each recovery faces its own obstacles, and understanding the forces acting on the economy at any point requires continual monitoring of a wide range of indicators of economic activity, household and business attitudes, financial market developments, and price pressures. In all cases, however, the touchstone guiding policy should be the mandate given to the Federal Reserve: a foundation of stable prices underpinning maximum sustainable growth.
Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency For Immediate Release July 22, 2004 Banking Agencies Delay Rollout of Web-Based Central Data Repository for Bank Financial Data The federal banking agencies announced today they will postpone the rollout of the Central Data Repository (CDR)--an Internet-based system created to modernize and streamline how the agencies collect, validate and distribute financial data, or "Call Reports," submitted by banks. Originally scheduled to be implemented on October 1, 2004, the system's start date will be delayed to address industry feedback and allow more time for testing and enrollment. A new timeline for implementation will be announced in August. The decision to delay implementation of the CDR was made to address delays in system development and testing. Moreover, the agencies had received an increasing number of questions and concerns about the new system from banks, industry trade associations, software vendors and other stakeholders. Initial testing of the system has demonstrated that the technology chosen is sound and that the XBRL standard underlying the system's framework will perform as required. However, Call Report data represent a critical source of information for the bank supervision process, and the banking agencies determined that a postponement is warranted. The agencies are considering alternative plans for the CDR rollout, including phasing in the new technology and business models in separate reporting quarters. For now, the agencies will continue to collect, validate and manage Call Report data using their existing processing systems. This includes the retention of Electronic Data Services Corporation as the agencies' electronic collection agent for Call Report data. Accordingly, banks will continue filing their Call Report in the same manner until they are notified by the agencies to begin using the new CDR system. This initiative--the "Call Report Modernization Project"--is an interagency effort under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). Additional project details and other important information are posted on the FFIEC's web site at .

Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For Immediate Release July 28, 2004 Agencies Issue Bank Secrecy Act Examination Procedures Relating to Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act The federal financial institutions regulatory agencies today issued Bank Secrecy Act (B.S.A.) procedures for examining each domestic and foreign banking organization's customer identification program (CIP) which is required by section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act (codified in the B.S.A. at 31 U.S.C. 5318(l)). The procedures are designed to help financial institutions fully implement the new CIP requirements and facilitate a consistent supervisory approach among the federal financial institutions regulatory agencies. The USA PATRIOT Act, signed into law on October 26, 2001, establishes new and enhanced measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute money laundering and terrorism. The regulation implementing section 326 of the Act requires each financial institution to implement a written CIP that includes certain minimum requirements and is appropriate for its size and type of business. The CIP must be incorporated into the financial institution's anti-money laundering compliance program, which is subject to approval by the financial institution organization's board of directors. Compliance with the regulation was required by October 1, 2003.
