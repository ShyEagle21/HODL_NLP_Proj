Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan Current fiscal issues Before the Committee on the Budget, U.S. House of Representatives September 12, 2002 I am pleased to appear here today to discuss some of the important issues related to the outlook for the economy and the attendant implications for the formulation of fiscal policy. The views I will be expressing are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board. The U.S. economy has confronted very significant challenges over the past year--major declines in equity markets, a sharp retrenchment in investment spending, and the tragic terrorist attacks of last September. To date, the economy appears to have withstood this set of blows well, although the depressing effects still linger and continue to influence, in particular, the federal budget outlook. A year ago, the Congressional Budget Office expected the unified budget to post large and mounting surpluses over the coming decade. As you know, CBO is currently forecasting that, if today's policies remain in place, the unified budget will post deficits through fiscal year 2005. For the fiscal year just ending, CBO now projects a budget balance that is more than $300 billion below the level it had projected a year ago. To a degree, the return to budget deficits resulted from temporary factors, especially the falloff in revenues and the increase in outlays associated with the economic downturn. But some of the factors accounting for the weaker budget outlook will have longer-lasting effects. A large portion of this year's decline in individual income tax revenues is clearly related to the retrenchment in equity markets. The sharp decline in stock prices appears to have markedly reduced final settlements for the 2001 tax year, as well as receipts on 2002 income. This effect works directly through less tax revenue from capital gains realizations, and indirectly through less revenue collected from the exercise of stock options, from stock-price-related bonuses, and from withdrawals from IRAs and 401(k) plans that have been augmented by capital gains. Although official projections had been based on the assumption that tax collections related to the stock market would eventually decline from the elevated levels of the late 1990s, the sharp drop in equity markets was not expected, and the fallout from it will likely damp tax revenues relative to earlier expectations for some time. Furthermore, the precipitous fall in tax receipts may have resulted from other factors as well--for example, a shift in the distribution of income from higher to lower tax brackets and a change in the timing of tax collections. The recent surge in discretionary spending, necessitated only in part by the war on terrorism and the need for enhanced homeland security, has also made the budget picture less sanguine. Nonetheless, despite the budget erosion over the past year, our underlying fiscal situation today remains significantly stronger than that of a decade ago, when policymakers were struggling to rein in chronic large deficits and the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product was approaching 50 percent and climbing. This turnaround was the result of several factors. To an extent, the fiscal improvement can be traced to the emergence of forces largely external to the fiscal process. The end of the Cold War yielded a substantial peace dividend, and the pickup in productivity growth and surging stock market substantially boosted tax collections. But such forces alone cannot wholly account for the improvement in the fiscal situation. Prudent policy also played an important role. After years of budgetary profligacy, a political consensus to move toward a balanced budget slowly emerged. Beginning in the late 1980s, impressive progress was made in restraining federal expenditures and restoring a better balance between spending and revenues. Even with a consensus to balance the budget, such progress might have been elusive were it not for the procedural mechanisms that were developed to enforce that political consensus. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, building on earlier initiatives, provided such mechanisms. The statutory limits on discretionary spending and the so-called PAYGO rules requiring changes in mandatory spending and revenue policies to be budget-neutral, backed by a 60-vote point of order in the Senate, served as useful tools to control deficits. In essence, the rules provided a means for advancing the broader good of sound fiscal policy over narrower interests. The budget rules worked far better than many skeptics, myself included, had expected. Between 1990 and 1998, discretionary spending fell from more than 10 percent of GDP to less than 6 ï¿½ percent. The end of the Cold War was clearly a critical factor behind this decline, but the statutory caps helped to hold nondefense discretionary expenditures in check, and allowed the benefits of the decline in defense needs to go toward reducing deficits rather than toward facilitating increases in other spending. The PAYGO rules changed the way policymakers analyzed fiscal policy proposals: Rather than focusing solely on the benefits of a proposal, policymakers were required to recognize the costs as well. The Budget Enforcement Act was intended to address the problem of huge deficits. In 1990, the possibility that surpluses might emerge within the decade seemed remote indeed. When they unexpectedly arrived, the budget control measures appeared to be addressing a problem that had been solved. Fiscal discipline seemed a less pressing priority and was increasingly abandoned. Though the 1990 act was not amended, policymakers found ways to circumvent the discretionary caps and the PAYGO rules. They did not anticipate--and, indeed, there were few indications--that deficits were about to reemerge. Given the recent change in budget outlook, the commitment to fiscal responsibility that served us so well must now be reestablished. The budget enforcement rules are set to expire on September 30. Failing to preserve them would be a grave mistake. For without clear direction and constructive goals, the inbuilt political bias in favor of budget deficits likely will again become entrenched. We are all too aware that government spending programs and special tax benefits can be easy to initiate or expand but extraordinarily difficult to trim or shut down once constituencies develop that have a stake in maintaining the status quo. However, spending and tax-cutting restraint are not symmetrical. While there is no upside limit to spending, taxes cannot go below zero. In any case, the bottom line is that if we do not preserve the budget rules and reaffirm our commitment to fiscal responsibility, years of hard effort could be squandered. In considering the extension of the Budget Enforcement Act, some have suggested amending the budget rules to limit the scope for circumventing the spending caps through the use of an "emergency" spending designation. Others have suggested rules that would be more flexible in the event of budget surpluses. These are thoughtful initiatives, but they are secondary to ensuring that the basic framework not be abandoned. Restoring fiscal discipline must be a high priority. Besides the near-term budgetary shortfalls that we currently face, the aging of the population presents a daunting long-term fiscal challenge. Indeed, the extent of that challenge is not adequately reflected in conventional measures of the federal budget. Scoring the budget on an accrual basis--the private sector norm and, I believe, a sensible direction for federal budget accounting--would better underscore the tradeoffs we face. Under accrual accounting, benefits would be counted as they are earned by workers rather than when they are paid out by the government. This method allows us to keep better track of the future obligations that the government has incurred. Under full accrual accounting, the social security program would have shown a substantial deficit last year, rather than the surplus measured under our current cash-accounting regimen. Such accruals take account of still-growing contingent liabilities, which currently, under most reasonable sets of actuarial assumptions, amount to many trillions of dollars for social security benefits alone. The contingent liabilities implicit in the Medicare program are much more difficult to calculate--but they are also likely in the trillions of dollars. These liabilities are fast approaching their due date. With the baby boom generation beginning to retire in just six short years, cash benefits will soon begin to rise rapidly, exerting pressure on the unified budget. Given the imminence of these demographic pressures, we need to begin deciding exactly how to reform our retirement programs to close the gap between unified budget outlays and revenues. In essence, we will have to decide how to allocate available resources. All possible policy solutions should be on the table. Recently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics introduced a new index that could provide a more accurate measure of the cost of living for the indexation of both retirement benefits and tax brackets. More fundamentally, the way to prepare for the challenges ahead is to increase the real resources that will be available to meet those looming needs. The greater the resources available --that is, the greater the output of goods and services produced by our economy--the easier it will be to provide real benefits to retirees without unduly restraining the consumption of workers and without imposing large tax increases that would damp incentives and reduce economic growth. Although other elements are involved in long-run productivity growth, clearly, the more capital that is available per worker, the greater productivity will be, all other things being equal. The level of national savings, the primary source of capital investment financing, is significantly affected by the level of government saving (surpluses) or dissaving (deficits). Between 1992 and 2001, decreasing federal budget deficits followed by surpluses were important to maintaining national saving in the face of declining private saving, a factor likely contributing to the marked step-up in productivity growth. Returning to a fiscal climate of continuous large deficits would risk returning to an era of high interest rates, low levels of investment, and slower growth of productivity. To be sure, at the moment, Treasury rates are at the lowest level in more than forty years, and I can scarcely argue that deficits are pressuring interest rates. And, indeed, our current fiscal situation remains more favorable than it has over much of the past few decades. But history suggests that an abandonment of fiscal discipline will eventually push up interest rates, crowd out capital spending, lower productivity growth, and force harder choices upon us in the future. To summarize, now is not the time to abandon the discipline and structure that worked so well for so long. The framework enacted in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, and extended several times, must be preserved. Current budget projections remain relatively favorable, but those projections will be realized only under a disciplined approach to fiscal policy. Though undeniably difficult, following such a strategy will best prepare us for the fiscal pressures that will almost surely arise as the baby boom generation begins to retire.

For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board today announced its approval of the application by Herky Hawk Financial Corporation, Monticello, Iowa, to acquire all the voting shares of New Vienna Savings Bank, New Vienna, Iowa; Casey State Bank, Casey, Illinois; and to merge with Biggsville Financial Corporation, and thereby acquire all the voting shares of First State Bank of Biggsville, both in Biggsville, Illinois. Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action.
Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan At the opening of the new HM Treasury Building, London, U.K. September 25, 2002 Policy Coordination Dedication speeches are by their nature forward looking, but lest we believe that in opening this building we should focus solely on future challenges, I feel the necessity of reminding us all that the future is not always new. I myself was reminded of this by an item on the web site of Her Majesty's Treasury. "In 1711," the item notes, "the Treasury unveiled a scheme to secure government debt by authorising its subscription into the capital of the South Sea Company--government creditors received stock in the company. When the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, however, thousands of investors were affected and the Chancellor of the Exchequer was sent to the Tower of London." Although the web site does not elaborate, that eighteenth century chancellor was guilty of dubious practices that appear eerily contemporary. Fortunately, modern chancellors, including the eminent incumbent, appear at the Tower these days in a more benign context. In a more serious vein, I am daily reminded of the special relationship the Federal Reserve has had over the decades with decisionmakers from the British government. Literally twenty feet from my desk are plaques commemorating the numerous World War II meetings in our Board Room between the combined military chiefs of the United States and Great Britain that in the words on one plaque, "... set the pattern for allied collaboration and the successful prosecution of World War II." But the Federal Reserve's association with Britain's monetary authorities goes back even further. The tie between the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve was cemented during the 1920s in that extraordinary relationship between Benjamin Strong, the President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and Montague Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England. Their correspondence yields quite fascinating insight into the way they interpreted events that are now important history. The ties developed then between the Federal Reserve and British monetary authorities endure to this day. The mutual trust reached a point that in 1999 the Bank of England asked Donald Kohn, then head of our Monetary Affairs Division, and now a governor, to review key aspects of the Bank of England's monetary policy procedures and make recommendations for improvement. We were duly impressed because, to us at the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England projects a nearly mythical presence as the developer of much of the central banking we all practice today. The Federal Reserve's close relationship with the Bank of England and other major central banks has been enhanced through periodic meetings at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel since 1963. But it has been over only the past quarter century, with the emergence of regular meetings of the finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Five, and later the Group of Seven, that interactions between the Federal Reserve and the British Treasury and other major finance ministries have taken on special importance. Of course, some of us meet under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and we all participate in the deliberations of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But the Group of Seven has surfaced as the most significant forum through which both finance ministers and central bankers from the major countries coordinate on economic issues. International coordination has also been advanced with the creation of the Financial Stability Forum, an initiative of the G-7 that draws on the Secretariat of the Bank for International Settlements. And the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that evolved out of initial explorations of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England has broadened international bank supervisory coordination. In recent years, both the G-7 and the BIS have reached out to expand our contact with ministers and governors of developing countries. A new group, the Group of Twenty, encompasses many industrial countries and a number of developing nations. Today's remarkably sophisticated international financial system, that all these bodies oversee, took root several centuries ago within hailing distance of Her Majesty's Treasury. The rule of law and protection of property rights attracted transactions to the London market and--notwithstanding the one incident of questionable behavior in 1720 noted earlier--the British tradition of trust, integrity, and fair dealing has been an important component of the City's success. London, and other British financial centers, had developed by World War I into the dominant lender to the world, accounting for half of the world's trade financing and, despite its loss of empire, London remains, with New York, at the top of the world's financial pyramid. The City has a long tradition of leading the world in foreign exchange trading and currently conducts twice the volume of New York despite the fact that the U.S. dollar is the leading traded currency by far in foreign exchange transactions. London is the world's center for over the counter derivatives trading--again with double the share of the trading in similar instruments conducted in New York. Moreover, a substantial share of the world's securities trading is channeled through the City. London has stayed on top in the provision of financial services despite the emergence of the euro, which some expected would divert a significant share of foreign exchange trading to a single center on the continent. Although financial sector activity in Frankfurt has increased substantially in the past few years, largely reflecting the growing importance of the euro, trading volumes there are still well below those of London and New York. Another potential challenge to the City's prominence in the provision of financial services has been the telecommunications revolution, which presumably should diminish the need for physical proximity to conduct financial transactions. If traders can congregate almost anywhere electronically, we might expect traditional patterns of exchange to be dispersed. However, history, together with London's long, should I say sterling, reputation as a place to do business, seems to have spurred market participants to continue to trade through London. In closing, let me emphasize what a privilege it has been for me to work with Chancellor Brown and Governor George, who represent the professional best in world finance and who are most worthy custodians of the financial legacy that Britain has bestowed on the rest of the world.
Testimony of Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. The proposed Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act Before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives September 25, 2002 I would like to thank the subcommittee for inviting me to discuss H.R. 5414, the proposed Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. This bill, which is similar to a proposal the Board sent to Congress late last year, removes existing legal barriers to the use of new technology in check processing and holds the promise of a more efficient check collection system. The Board commends Representatives Ferguson and Ford for introducing this bill. Technological Advances in Check Processing Check processing is far more efficient than it once was. Less than fifty years ago, clerks hand sorted millions of checks each day. In the 1960s, the banking industry began to use mechanical high-speed check processing equipment to read and sort checks, which had been redesigned for automated processing. Today, banks, thrifts, and credit unions, which I will collectively refer to as banks, process the more than 40 billion checks that consumers, businesses, and the government write each year. Legal impediments, however, have prevented the banking industry from fully using these new electronic technologies, such as digital imaging, to improve check processing efficiency and provide improved services to customers. This is because existing law requires that the original paper checks be presented for payment unless the banks involved agree otherwise. We can see how this requirement constrains technological adoption by following a check through the collection process. After a bank's customer deposits a check with his or her bank, the bank typically transports the check from the branch or ATM where it was deposited to a central operations center. The check is then usually sent to one or more intermediaries -- such as a Federal Reserve Bank or a correspondent bank -- or a clearinghouse for collection before it is ultimately delivered to the bank on which it is drawn for payment. During each step of this process, the check must be physically shipped to its destination by air or ground transportation. Of course, banks can agree to accept checks electronically, but the large number of banks in the United States makes it infeasible for any one bank to obtain such agreements from all other banks or even a large proportion of them. Therefore, legal changes are needed to facilitate the use of technologies that could improve check processing efficiency, which should lead to substantial reductions in transportation and other check processing costs. H.R. 5414 makes such changes. Proposed Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act The proposed Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act solves a longstanding dilemma -- how to foster check truncation early in the check collection or return process without mandating that banks accept checks in electronic form. The term check truncation refers to any of a number of arrangements in which the original paper checks are removed from the collection or return process. Currently, under typical check truncation arrangements, electronic information about a truncated check is presented to the bank on which it is drawn rather than the original paper check. The act facilitates check truncation by creating a new negotiable instrument called a substitute check, which would permit banks to truncate the original checks, to process the check information electronically, and to deliver substitute checks to banks that want to continue receiving paper checks. A substitute check, which would be the legal equivalent of the original check, would include all the information contained on the original check -- that is, an image of the front and back of the original check as well as the machine-readable numbers that appear on the bottom of the check. Under this act, while a bank could no longer demand to receive the original check, it could still demand to receive a paper check. Banks would likely receive a mix of original checks and substitute checks. Because substitute checks could be processed just like original checks, a bank would not need to invest in any new technology or otherwise change its current check processing operations. Banks could use the new authority provided in this legislation in a number of different ways. For example, a bank would no longer need to send couriers every afternoon to each of its branches and ATMs to pick up checks that customers have deposited. Instead, digital images of checks could be transmitted electronically from those locations to the bank's operations center for processing. Not only would this be quicker and more efficient, but it could permit banks to establish branches or ATMs in more remote locations and to provide later deposit cut-off hours to their customers. Moreover, the act would give a bank the flexibility to transmit checks electronically over long distances, and create substitute checks at locations near their ultimate destination, for example to the bank on which the checks are drawn, substantially reducing the time and cost associated with physical transportation. By enabling the banking industry to reduce its reliance on physical transportation, the proposed act would also reduce the risk that checks may be lost or delayed in transit. Today, bad weather routinely delays check shipments and there have been occasions when checks have been destroyed in plane crashes. The banking industry's extensive reliance on air transportation was underscored in the aftermath of the September 11 tragedy, when air transportation came to a standstill and the flow of checks slowed dramatically. During the week of the attacks, the Federal Reserve Banks' daily check float, which is normally a few hundred million dollars, ballooned to more than $47 billion. Had the proposed legislation been in effect at that time and had banks been using a robust electronic infrastructure for check collection, banks would have been able to collect many more checks by transmitting electronic check information across the country and presenting substitute checks to paying banks. Finally, many banks hope to use the authority provided by this legislation to streamline the processing of checks that they must return unpaid. Today, after a bank processes its incoming checks and determines which checks to return, it has to reprocess all of the incoming checks to pull out the less than one percent of checks that are to be returned unpaid. Many banks have indicated to us that they would find it more cost effective to use their image systems to generate substitute checks for return rather than to outsort the returned checks from all the checks presented. The act might also better position banks to provide new and improved services to their customers. For example, banks might allow some corporate customers to transmit their deposits electronically. Because the act will likely encourage greater investments in image technology, banks might also be able to expand their customers' access to enhanced account information and check images through the Internet. In addition, banks might be able to resolve customer inquiries more easily and quickly than today by accessing check images. The act is designed to provide banks with additional flexibility in processing checks by requiring banks to accept substitute checks in place of original checks. The act does not, however, require banks to accept checks in electronic form nor does it require banks to use the new authority granted by the act to create substitute checks. This market-based approach permits each bank to decide whether to make use of this new authority. This decision will be based on the bank's internal business case analysis, which will assess the costs and benefits of using the new authority. We believe the market changes arising from these revisions to check law will result in substantial cost savings. Clearly, because substitute checks can be processed in the same manner as original checks, recipients of substitute checks should incur little or no additional processing costs. Recipients, however, will incur some additional costs relating to the act's customer protection and disclosure requirements. It is difficult, however, to estimate the overall cost savings. Different banks will take different approaches toward using the new authority granted by the act. Each bank's use of the new authority will depend on its technology infrastructure and strategy, its physical infrastructure, and its customer and business profiles. Thus, the magnitude of the cost savings, which will depend on the rate at which banks begin using the new authority, is difficult to determine. We recognize that the most challenging policy issue in the proposed law, and the aspect of this legislation that has generated the most spirited discussion, relates to customer protections. Current check law protects customers if there is an unauthorized debit to their accounts. A customer already has a claim against its bank for an unauthorized charge, and the bank may be liable for interest on the amount of the unauthorized charge and consequential damages for the wrongful dishonor of any subsequently presented checks. The proposed legislation applies these existing protections to substitute checks. There are, however, differing views as to whether additional customer protections are necessary for substitute checks and, if so, how extensive those protections should be. We believe that, in determining the form these protections should take, the associated benefits and costs will need to be carefully balanced. Federal Reserve Board Authority to Regulate the Payments System We understand that there is some debate regarding whether the Federal Reserve Board already has sufficient statutory authority to adopt by regulation the concepts embodied in this proposed legislation. Although Congress has given the Board authority to regulate the check system and other aspects of the payments system, we do not believe that this authority is sufficiently broad to enable us to adopt regulations that accomplish the purposes of the act. In the 1987 Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA), Congress gave the Board broad authority to regulate "any aspect of the payment system, including the receipt, payment, collection, or clearing of checks; and any related function of the payment system with respect to checks" in order to carry out the EFAA. The EFAA also provides that the Board's regulations supersede any inconsistent provision in state law, including the Uniform Commercial Code. In the EFAA, Congress directed the Board to consider requiring, by regulation, a number of measures to improve the check system. Many of these measures focused on improving the process by which unpaid checks are returned to the bank of first deposit. Other suggested measures related to check truncation. The Board has used its authority under the EFAA to make several important improvements to the check system. The Board's ability to adopt some rules to improve the check system is hampered, however, by the EFAA's limitation on the Board's ability to impose or allocate the risks of loss or liability related to payment transactions. The EFAA authorizes the Board to impose on or allocate among only depository institutions the risks of loss or liability, and only up to the amount of the check giving rise to the loss or liability, except where there is bad faith. These limitations have prevented the Board from adopting by regulation some important innovations that could substantially improve the efficiency of the check system. For example, the Board cannot adopt by regulation the changes called for in the proposed Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, because the bill affects the rights of the end users of checks (including businesses and consumers), in particular their right to receive their original checks, and allocates liability for not only the amount of the check but also interest, litigation costs, and in some cases consequential damages. Conclusion In conclusion, although an increasing number of payments are being made electronically, it is clear that checks will continue to play an important role in the nation's payments system for the foreseeable future. We believe that, over the long run, the concepts embodied in the proposed Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act will spur the use of new technologies to improve the efficiency of the nation's check collection system and provide better services to bank customers. Because the act should result in substantial cost savings, it would also be desirable to begin obtaining these savings in the near future, ideally before the bill's proposed 2006 effective date. There are some technical matters in the current version of the bill that could be improved or clarified, and we look forward to working with the Committee as it further considers this legislation. Thank you for your time and I would be happy to answer your questions.

For immediate release
Remarks by Governor Susan S. Bies Before the Pennsylvania Association of Community Bankers, Memphis, Tennessee September 28, 2002 Bank Performance and Corporate Governance Good morning. Thank you for the invitation to speak to members of the Pennsylvania Association of Community Bankers and to return to my home of twenty-four years, Memphis, Tennessee. Some of you have asked if I have had any surprises in my new role as a Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. I must say that the biggest surprise is the amount of required reading. I haven't read so much on so many different topics since I was in graduate school! Not only do I get to discuss economics and monetary policy, but also--as chair of the Board's bank supervision committee--I am deeply involved in bank regulation and operations issues. Even though I brought with me twenty-seven years of banking experience, including an earlier stint with the Federal Reserve, I find that my current responsibilities make me consider issues in new ways. Consequently, I look forward to meeting with groups like yours so that I have a better understanding of emerging issues from diverse perspectives. In my comments today, I will first address the recent financial performance of U.S. banks, and of community banks in particular. I will then turn to improvements that banks large and small are making in measuring and managing risk, the responsibilities of directors and senior managers in corporate governance, and finally, to the importance of sound accounting practices. In my view, these topics are inextricably linked and in light of continuing questions of confidence in America's corporations, they are quite timely. Financial Condition of U.S. Banks Last year was exceptional in many respects, with the United States slipping into a recession, the September terrorist attacks, the stock market declines, and all of the related events. In response, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates at every meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2001 and an additional three times between meetings, for a total of eleven rate cuts accumulating to 475 basis points. Since then, the Federal Reserve has shifted its bias from one in which we were concerned more with weakness, to one in which the risks of inflation and weakness were balanced, then back again--most recently--to a concern about economic growth. The direct effects of the past year's stressful events were painful enough. In addition, abusive accounting and corporate-governance practices made conditions worse, as large corporate bankruptcies imposed substantial losses on investors, lenders, and employees. These domestic events increased the uncertainty about earnings reported by other firms and dampened financial markets that were already weak. Abroad, Argentina's economic and political difficulties reminded us, yet again, that exposures to emerging economies can also present substantial risk. Throughout this period, the U.S. banking system remained strong, reporting continuing record earnings and profitability, despite a slip in asset quality. During the first half of this year, U.S. insured commercial banks earned more than $44.5 billion and an annualized return on assets of 1.37 percent. Both figures represent the industry's best six-month performance ever and reflect impressive growth on top of what were already impressive results. Net interest income was the primary driver of increased revenue, despite a notable decline in commercial loan volume. Loan loss provisions remained relatively high by the standards of most of the past decade but dipped notably from the second half of 2001. Net charge-offs, which were concentrated among commercial loans of large banks and credit card specialty lenders, also dropped. While this improvement since year-end may signal that problem assets have peaked, some large institutions have not yet fully recognized the results of this year's supervisory assessment of shared national credits. Consequently, we may see further deterioration in asset quality during the periods ahead. Moreover, the general economy needs to strengthen further before we can be much more comfortable that we're out of the woods. As noted, current weaknesses appear to be largely within the commercial loan portfolios of large regional and money center banks rather than those of smaller institutions. Even the problems of large banks could be viewed as mild, however, given the shocks felt by many in their customer base. In some respects, bank performance may reflect improvements in risk-management practices and also the greater diversification of revenues and exposures that has occurred in the past decade. Bank performance also reflects, I believe, a greater awareness by institutions throughout the banking system that they should promptly address problems as they emerge. During this recession and recovery, both the banking industry and the regulatory agencies appear to have responded well, by acting in a timely manner and without unnecessarily constraining bank credit. That positive outcome was made easier, of course, because the banking system was strong as challenges began to build. Because the industry had the earnings and capital to absorb increased losses, there was time and opportunity to deal more calmly with emerging weakness. If smaller banks, generally, are not seeing the commercial loan weakness that some larger institutions are facing, which areas may present them with heightened risks? A couple of possibilities come to mind. First, for most of the past decade, community banks--particularly those in the asset range of $100 million to $1 billion--have actively expanded their commercial real estate lending. Since the early 1990s, larger community banks have expanded these portfolios from 13 percent to 22 percent of aggregate assets. Most Reserve Banks are reporting generally weak commercial real estate markets, as failing companies vacate office and retail space and renters move into single family homes. Commercial real estate credits are still performing relatively well for this stage of the cycle, and my comments are not intended to suggest a material concern. Nevertheless, they account for most of the increase in nonperforming assets over the past year for large community banks. Given the checkered history of commercial real estate lending and its increased relevance to many banks, this portfolio must be monitored and managed carefully. We have seen before the cyclical nature of commercial real estate and its links to the general level of economic activity. The loss of anchor firms such as K-Mart, for example, may reduce the market value of certain shopping centers and the consumer traffic and the financial strength of nearby businesses as well. The second area of potential risk relates to interest rates. For the industry overall, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts last year certainly appear to have helped bank earnings, but they present management with new challenges, too. Lower rates undoubtedly eased payment pressures on many borrowers and prevented further deterioration in the quality of bank loan portfolios. Nearly 60 percent of all banks also saw wider net interest margins in the first six months of 2002 than in the comparable period of 2001. At some point, however, lower interest rates may begin to compress net interest margins for some institutions as deposit rates reach their effective floors. Those holding low-yielding, long-term assets could get hurt. Indeed, many banks have responded to the low rates by sharply reducing their investments in Treasuries and shifting funds into mortgage-backed securities in the search for higher yields. Given the historically low interest rates at which recent mortgages have been originated or refinanced, one might expect these loans to be prepaid much more slowly than they have typically been in the past. As a result, the effective maturity, or duration, of bank securities portfolios--and of many loan portfolios as well--has been extended. Clearly, I am not about to forecast interest rates--something I've already learned that central bankers never do. My point is that banking organizations, and investors generally, should recognize that domestic interest rates are historically low and that the possibility for a rising rate environment should not be overlooked. Even stable rates could present increased risks, if savings and money market deposit accounts flow out of banks as quickly as they came in when equity markets declined. We should all ask ourselves how long depositors would be content to earn the currently low rates when those markets stabilize or improve or interest rates rise once again. At some point, even loyal customers--those on fixed incomes, in particular--may blink and take steps to improve their own yields. Managing Risks The health of financial institutions today is also a result of improvement in the risk-management process that has been ongoing at banks for years. Increasingly, the entire risk management process has become more quantitative, reflecting not only the enhanced ability to collect and process data at lower cost, but also improved techniques for measuring and managing risk. As you are aware, bank regulators are working to develop a more modern international approach to bank capital--called Basel II. Although those standards, in the first instance, are being designed to address changing practices at large, internationally active banks, we can expect the lessons learned about risk management to have much broader effects. We do not anticipate, for example, that large numbers of banking organizations in the United States would formally adopt the data and analytically intensive and sophisticated processes to determine regulatory capital under development today. The costs and resources to develop such systems and frameworks are beyond the resources of all but a limited number of very large banks. We would expect, though, that the effort would eventually strengthen risk management and provide best practice examples industry wide. In quantifying credit risk, larger banking organizations are taking the lead, measuring a borrower's probability of default, the bank's loss given default and its likely exposure to the borrower at the time of default, taking into consideration future draw downs. The greater use of credit scoring in retail transactions provides a stronger framework to assess risk and ensure that loan pricing reflects the credit quality. Such tools should perform even better as the effects of the most recent economic slowdown are incorporated into bank statistics. Most consumer credit models were developed after the 1990-91 recession, and so their reliability in predicting default rates and losses during a severe economic slowdown is yet to be fully tested. We are already observing, for example, significant increases in delinquencies in subprime lending. Since many of these borrowers did not have significant access to credit in previous recessions, their ultimate default rate should help validate the strength of the new statistical models. The measurement and management of interest rate risk has also improved greatly in recent years, perhaps particularly at community banks. Asset/liability committees at banks throughout the country now routinely consider the results of models developed either internally or by vendors to identify the market sensitivity of loans, investments, and deposits. As a result, managers can better anticipate changes in net interest income and develop responses to their specific circumstances. The industry is also developing new revenue streams and diversifying its earnings sources. Such efforts help increase the cross-sell ratio with key customers, which in turn should improve customer loyalty and further stabilize a bank's revenue base. Providing the personal touch has long served community banks well, but personalized service alone may become less sufficient in the years ahead. Conducting sound market research and pricing to reflect competition, customer value, and underlying risk are becoming more important for success. Recent abuses of corporate accounting practices and other matters provide good lessons in risk management as bankers try to increase earnings by cross-selling more products. We have seen, for example, how conflicts of interest and the lack of a strong quality-assurance function destroyed the reputation and viability of a major accounting firm. Similarly, banks that compensate line officers on the basis of sales and cross- selling must guard against the adverse incentives that those compensation structures can provide. There, too, a strong quality-assurance function is essential. Given the dominant role of credit risk at banks, the chief credit officer should ensure that pressures to increase fee income do not lead to unacceptable levels of credit risk. Corporate Governance Sound corporate governance is an essential element of a strong risk-management process. As bankers and bank directors, you have specific responsibilities to manage the risks at your financial institutions and effectively oversee the systems of internal controls. Not only are the activities of banks central to credit intermediation, but, in this country, banks fund their activities in part with federally insured deposits. Those deposits are the lowest-cost source of funds that banks have, specifically because of the government's guarantee. Bank directors are not expected to understand every nuance of banking or to oversee each transaction. They can look to management for that. They do, however, have the responsibility to set the tone regarding their institution's risk-taking and to oversee the internal-control processes so that they can reasonably expect that their directives will be followed. They also have the responsibility to hire individuals who they believe have integrity and can exercise a high level of judgment and competence. In the light of recent events, I might add that directors have the further responsibility to periodically consider whether their initial assessment of management's integrity remains correct. Interagency policy holds boards of directors responsible for ensuring that their organizations have an effective audit process and internal controls that are adequate for the nature and scope of their businesses. The reporting lines of the internal audit function should be such that the information that directors receive is impartial and not unduly influenced by management. Internal audit is a key element of management's responsibility to validate the strength of a bank's internal controls. In the limited cases in which that function must be outsourced, best practice is to avoid using the same firm for the external audit as well. Internal controls are the responsibility of line management. Line managers must determine the level of risks they need to accept to run their businesses and must assure themselves that the combination of earnings, capital, and internal controls is sufficient to compensate for the risk exposures. Supporting functions such as accounting, internal audit, risk management, credit review, compliance, and legal, should independently monitor the control processes to ensure that they are effective and that risks are measured appropriately. The results of these independent reviews should be routinely reported to executive management and boards of directors. Both executive management and directors should be sufficiently engaged in the process to determine whether these reviews are in fact independent of the operating areas under review and whether the officers conducting the reviews can, indeed, speak freely. The level of independence from executive management that a board can demonstrate has, of course, become a far more visible and more important factor in evaluating corporate governance. Recent audit failures have highlighted the value of sound practices, such as having audit committee members regularly meet privately with an institution's outside auditors to discuss matters without management present. The recent Conference Board and New York Stock Exchange recommendations, or prior reports by the Blue Ribbon Committee and the Treadway Commission in the 1980s describe best practices for audit committees and are worthy of your review. This summer, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act took the matter of independence a step further, in the case of publicly traded firms, by incorporating specific requirements of independence into law. For example, all members of a company's audit committee must now be outside directors. Moreover, at least one of those committee members should be a so-called financial expert. If not, the firm must disclose why not. The legislation also assigns audit committees sole and direct responsibility for appointing, compensating, and overseeing the company's auditors. Other provisions of the act set forth potentially broad ranging standards affecting the way public companies compensate their executives and directors and disclose their operating results. To strengthen the role of outside auditors, the act also limits the non-audit work such firms may perform for audit customers and creates an oversight board to regulate and oversee audit work. Precisely how some of these legislative provisions will affect firms has yet to be decided by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other provisions, though, are in effect now or will become effective soon and warrant immediate attention. Although the act applies only to institutions that register their shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission, its elements should be considered by virtually all commercial banks and by most other companies of any material size. They could well highlight weaknesses in your own procedures. Indeed, beyond legal requirements, boards of directors and managers of all firms should periodically test where they stand on ethical business practices. They should ask, for example, "Are we getting by on technicalities, adhering to the letter but not the spirit of the law? Are we compensating ourselves and others on the basis of contribution, or are we taking advantage of our positions?" Ultimately, of course, markets correct their excesses, and in this context "markets" include both the public and private sectors. Obviously, during the past year we've seen reactions not only from investors and creditors, but also from lawmakers and regulators, to observed failures within corporate boardrooms. All of the actions affect market practice. My intent today is to remind you that as business and community leaders, you should recognize the value of exercising self-discipline within your own institutions. That includes maintaining sound ethical practices in protecting the reputations of your banks. As we have seen from recent events, the market's response can be harsh. Quality of Accounting Practices Uncertainty regarding the quality of corporate accounting standards strikes at the heart of our capitalist system and threatens the efficiency of our markets. Investors and lenders must be confident that they understand the risks they accept and that their counterparties are playing fair. For six years I was a member of the Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which provides the accounting industry with guidance in areas where financial reporting practices are diverging. During that time, I developed a better appreciation for the challenges that standard-setters face when dealing with topics that are becoming increasingly complex. Informed and objective professionals can legitimately disagree on the best accounting standard to apply to new types of transactions. That is part of the challenge of keeping accounting standards current. The rapid pace of business innovations makes it impractical to have rules in place to anticipate every business transaction. Rather, the more complex and dynamic the business world becomes, the more important it is that accounting be based on strong principles that are sufficiently robust to provide the framework for proper accounting of new types of transactions. At the core of such accounting principles should be professional standards that every corporate accountant and every outside auditor must follow. In part, auditors should be required to ask themselves whether a particular accounting method adequately represents the economics of the transaction and whether it provides readers with sufficient information to evaluate the risks. If not, it is likely that the procedure is not the best accounting method to apply. Rules alone, however, do not ensure good financial reporting. At Enron and other companies, weak corporate governance practices apparently permitted sham transactions and misleading financial reporting. Outside auditors erred in trying too hard to please an important client. They forgot that their professional role is to assure users of financial reports that the statements fairly represent the condition of the corporation and that they communicate, not conceal, the level of risk. Some observers have asserted that new accounting standards are needed. In some minor ways that may be true. But judging from publicly available information, I believe that what we need most is to restore the integrity of corporate accountants and the quality of the audit process, rather than impose extensive new rules. One reason that accounting in the United States has become so rule-based is that we tend to add new accounting standards when abuses occur even when the abuses resulted from accounting and audit failures. Rather than creating new rules, forming the new Public Company Oversight Board established by Sarbanes-Oxley may provide a better approach and help to refocus public accountants on core principles and away from more aggressive and misleading practices. Given human nature and the complexity of many accounting issues, we must expect that rules will sometimes be broken or misapplied. But a new, authoritative oversight board--combined with more-rigorous reviews by corporate boards--should be able to discourage and address severe abuses. For its part, the Federal Reserve is also willing to challenge accounting interpretations that it sees as too aggressive. By no means do we intend to supplant accounting authorities in making rules, but we do intend to provide discipline, when necessary, in their interpretations--particularly in the context of regulatory reporting and in light of the weaknesses in quality-assurance processes in public accounting firms. For example, the Federal Reserve has required loan pools at one large bank to be re-consolidated into their financial statements when it was determined that risk and control were not removed from that organization through the creation of special purpose vehicles. In another example, the banking regulators have jointly issued for comment new guidance related to credit cards. This guidance not only deals with unacceptable practices, but also clarifies that revenue recognition of fees billed to customers should reflect the expected ability to collect those fees. In addition to the recognition and measurement aspects of financial reporting, we need to continually evaluate the effectiveness of disclosures. Public disclosures by banks, as well as other firms, need not follow a standard framework that is exactly the same for all. Rather, we should insist that each entity disclose the information it believes its stakeholders need to evaluate its risk profile. Each business line in a complex organization is unique, and--to be most effective--the specific disclosures of its risks should be different, too. Even in smaller organizations, disclosures should be tailored to reflect the activities of the organization. A summary of the information that is important for executive management and the board of directors in monitoring the health of the bank is an excellent place to start to tailor the information that would be useful to investors and customers. That is the approach being taken in developing the Basel II Capital Accord. Disclosure rules that are too rigid may be, or become, incompatible with risk-management processes that continually evolve. In this area and many others, the best results are likely to come from bankers and regulators working together. Conclusion In closing, I congratulate you and the industry, generally, for successfully dealing with the challenges of the past year. The industry remains fundamentally sound and has consistently demonstrated that it can deal with stress. Nevertheless, no business can afford to remain static, and banks of all sizes should continually pursue better ways to manage risk. Following sound accounting, auditing, and disclosure practices consistently is also crucial to maintaining the confidence of capital and financial markets. We should learn from the experiences of this past year and ensure that our own accounting and control systems practices are sound. We should also take the opportunity to strengthen areas of corporate governance that may be weak. As bankers and bank regulators, we are responsible for conducting our affairs with competence and integrity. As we do so, our banking system should grow stronger still.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced the issuance of a Cease and Desist Order against Broadstreet, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia, a bank holding company, and Broadstreets subsidiary bank, the AmTrade International Bank of Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia. The consent Cease and Desist Order was jointly issued by the Federal Reserve Board and the state of Georgias Department of Banking and Finance on September 20, 2002. The Order incorporated the banks voluntary liquidation plan, which was approved by the states Department of Banking and Finance on August 9, 2002. The Order also completed the Federal Reserve Boards enforcement proceeding against the bank, which was initiated by the issuance of a Notice of Charges and of Hearing and Temporary Order to Cease and Desist on July 1, 2002. On Monday, September 30, the state of Georgia closed the bank and appointed the FDIC as receiver after the state determined that the bank was unable to meet the provisions of its voluntary liquidation plan. A copy of the Order is attached.
