Remarks by Governor Donald L. Kohn At the James R. Wilson Lecture Series, The College of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio October 11, 2005 Globalization, Inflation, and Monetary Policy Thank you for the opportunity to return to Wooster. In one sense, much has changed since my time here in the early 1960s, when my intellectual energy was too often focused on such pursuits as evading compulsory chapel in favor of coffee and a cigarette at The Shack. But in a much more important sense, the essence of the Wooster educational experience remains unchanged. I know from conversations, reading, and my occasional forays back to campus that Wooster continues to be a place where close, continuing contact with knowledgeable and enthusiastic scholars can open new horizons to students, shaping their subsequent intellectual lives and careers. I know that is what happened to me here. Another strong thread in the Wooster tradition has been putting the knowledge acquired here to work for the common good as well as for individual gain. In that tradition, I suggest to the students in the audience that you consider government service at some point in your careers. Governments at all levels have the power to help or harm. To increase the odds on the former, we need to apply the kinds of knowledge and analytic skills you are obtaining here. I can tell you from personal experience that going to work each morning knowing that how well you do your job could affect the welfare of your fellow citizens can be a little scary, but it is also tremendously challenging and rewarding. In keeping with the habits of mind I developed here, I approached this talk as a term paper project. I picked a topic that I wanted to think through, one that would not require any truly original research and could be done in a limited amount of time. Well, my Wooster experience has been replicated: The topic has turned out to be larger and more complex than I anticipated, I have been working and revising up to the last minute, and I have yet to arrive at very settled conclusions. Still, Wooster is an especially fitting venue for this assignment. I intend to spend much of the remaining time discussing the evolving linkages between globalization and monetary policy. And here, much is different from my undergraduate days, importantly because of the shift to flexible exchange rates in the early 1970s. If memory serves, this change was one I advocated in my senior Independent Study (IS) thesis in 1964, though I do not pretend that my effort was a cause of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system. Introductory Observations "Globalization" can mean many things, but tonight I mean it to refer to increased interdependence of national economies as reflected in greater and freer flows of goods, services, capital, and even labor across national borders. In recent years, world trade--imports and exports--has risen much faster than world income and production, and so has the flow of capital. No doubt the big players--multinational corporations and "production groups" in an intricate chain of subcontracting--have played a major role in this phenomenon. They have relocated production around the globe to more cost-efficient locations and prompted a worldwide expansion of trade in parts and semifinished goods as well as in final products. But increasingly, small businesses also are participating in global markets. When we hear the term "globalization," we tend to think first of trade in physical goods, but among the most striking aspects of recent developments is the expansion of global trade in services and the closer integration of global financial markets. Who has not had the experience of realizing that the person on the phone helping with a problem with software or a credit card lives in another country? Indeed, arrangements are now available to academic researchers to outsource their routine statistical work and other support to anonymous foreign research assistants via the Internet, though I doubt this technique is an acceptable approach for your IS project. The accelerated pace of globalization has reflected a number of key developments. Rapidly changing technology has reduced the cost of transporting goods and services; advances in computing and telecommunications have greatly facilitated the flow of information around the world. Recognizing the benefits to their citizens from greater economic integration, governments have reduced barriers to trade and capital flows. They have done this bilaterally, among groups of countries, between economic blocs, and on a regional basis--such as within the European Community and in the North American Free Trade Agreement in our own hemisphere. But we should not overlook the main drivers behind exploiting these opportunities--ourselves. As consumers responding to lower prices and the greater availability of goods and services, and as investors seeking higher returns on investment, we have forced the growth of cross-border trade and financial transactions. Globalization has widened product choice everywhere and lowered costs to consumers by improving the global allocation of resources and moving factors of production into their most effective uses. The consensus that market-based economic systems, open to competition and innovation, provide the most promising path to higher standards of living has also propelled these trends. Partly as a consequence, for the past fifteen years or so, globalization has featured the integration of three major economic regions--China, South Asia, and the former Soviet-bloc states--that previously had been essentially closed or at least heavily insulated from the global trading system. Although the details vary greatly, each of these regions has a large low-wage workforce. Many of the questions about the effects of globalization arise from the potential consequences of adding these workers to the global network of production and distribution. Their very low wages reflected their abysmally low productivity under the rigid economic and political systems they were saddled with. They will become more productive as they acquire the essential tools--physical capital, training, and the freedom to make choices--and their real wages will rise on average. Worker productivity and real wages could be expected to be boosted further by efficiency gains associated with the spread of new production methods, new technologies, and new skills that often accompany greater openness to trade and foreign investment. Think of it: Hundreds of millions of people are gaining the opportunity to climb out of poverty as a result of the possibilities generated by their participation in open trading and market systems. Such changes in previously underdeveloped areas of our globe cannot but have effects on prevailing economic relationships. The mix and location of production, relative product prices, and relative returns to the various inputs into production will change for economies already in the system, perhaps dramatically. From the introduction of large numbers of new workers into the global economy, we might expect to see returns on capital rise relative to returns on labor in those economies. In addition, we would expect to see downward pressure on the compensation of low-skill workers in those countries relative to that of their fellow citizens with higher skills. At the same time, prices of goods and services imported from newly industrializing economies will decline relative to the prices of the products they buy from us and other developed nations, effectively raising the real incomes of U.S. citizens. As part of this process, some dislocations are inevitable. Here in northern Ohio, the difficulties have been especially intense as less-expensive foreign-produced goods have become more readily available--to the detriment of local manufacturers and their employees. Expanding trade produces pain for some, as well as gain. But resisting adjustment would be costly to our society as a whole. We know from Smith and Ricardo that the welfare of all countries, whether new entrants or incumbents, should increase on balance from greater trade and specialization as well as from the ability of capital to find its highest return. Barriers to trade and other forms of protectionism not only interfere with these processes but also block the associated growth of productivity and, more generally, impede an economy's ability to weather shocks. They also put money on the table in the form of rents to be gained from keeping or evading the barriers, and the resulting rent-seeking behavior undercuts the rule of law and respect for government. Thus, sustaining the momentum toward freer trade, and at the same time helping people in this country adapt--by providing the skills necessary to share in the prosperity and by helping workers relocate to expanding sectors--are critical public policy issues today. These issues, although very important, are not the focus of my concerns tonight, however. I am going to address some of the effects of the process of globalization on my job as a central banker. Under the Federal Reserve Act, that job is to foster over the long run stable prices and maximum employment for the U.S. economy. Our instructions are not to focus on particular industries, sectors, or regions. Rather, what we can do is to provide, as best we can, a stable overall macroeconomic background to facilitate the many transitions and changes going on within the economy. If we did our job poorly and tolerated significant deviations from price stability and fluctuations in aggregate income and output, we would only add to the difficulties workers and businesses face in discerning the correct signals from evolving relative prices and in making the resultant necessary and beneficial adjustments in resource allocation. How we have needed to go about doing our job well has changed over the years with the evolution of international economic relationships. If we look back several decades--say, to the immediate post-World War II period--the external sector of the U.S. economy had a much smaller overall role and, correspondingly, a smaller place in U.S. macroeconomic policy than it does today. Because of the United States' great relative size and comparatively low degree of exposure to outside economic forces, foreign economic developments generally did not have material consequences on the U.S. macroeconomy. Moreover, international financial flows moved through only a few established channels. Exchange rates for the dollar with respect to major currencies were fixed in a system in which the United States enjoyed the "exorbitant privilege" of being the reserve currency. In effect, the United States was the "nth" country in the global economic system, meaning that U.S. economic preeminence implied that policy--including monetary policy--could be set essentially independently of the global economy; our trading partners would have to react to the downstream consequences of U.S. developments. The recovery of our trading partners from World War II, the development of more-sophisticated financial markets, the growth of trade, and the desires of other countries to pursue policies independent from those of the United States strained to the breaking point the exchange rate system put in place at the end of the war. In the early 1970s, we shifted from fixed exchange rates under the Bretton Woods system to the present arrangements, in which the dollar's value against major currencies is set by market forces. This change and the steady trends toward greater openness and integration that I described earlier have exposed our economy more directly to the effects of foreign developments. Swings in business cycles abroad, disruptions to the supply of imported goods like oil, and variations in exchange rates have left their imprint on the U.S. economy over the past thirty years. Importantly, the fallout from such shocks has not been restricted to its effects on our trade in goods and services; for some disturbances, links through the financial sector have been an important avenue of transmission. In the late 1990s, for example, financial crises in Asia, Latin America, and Russia created serious disturbances in the global financial system, posing new challenges for U.S. monetary policy makers. Although foreign shocks have been more noticeable as we have become more globalized, greater openness has probably not made our economy more volatile on balance. The reason is that the external sector also acts as a buffer for shocks that arise domestically. For example, a change in domestic demand should have a smaller effect on gross domestic product, employment, and prices in an open economy than in a closed one because some of its effect will fall on imports--through changes in income or the dollar's exchange rate, or both. In addition, the business cycles of the new entrants to global trading tend to be less closely in phase with cycles in already industrialized economies and, as a result, may have a damping effect on balance--although this effect might be expected to dissipate gradually as global integration proceeds. Perhaps the most consequential development for monetary policy was the shift to more-flexible exchange rates. This shift both lifted the constraint of defending the exchange rate and strengthened the effect of policy actions. According to the textbooks, when exchange rates can move, easier monetary policy--lower interest rates--should stimulate demand by depreciating the currency and boosting net exports as well as by reducing the cost of borrowing domestically. Similarly, tighter policy should restrain demand and hold down prices through an appreciation of the currency in addition to raising interest rates. Admittedly, the exchange rate channel does not always work this way in practice; among other things, exchange rates also depend on trade and current account balances and on what is happening in the economies of our trading partners; and currency values respond more to the expected pattern of interest rates here and abroad than to the current short-term rates that central banks control. These factors mean that the exchange rate sometimes moves in surprising directions, complicating monetary policy. Furthermore, the exchange rate channel can amplify the effects of mistaken policies--for example, the dollar may fall and add to domestic inflation pressures if the stance of policy is overly accommodative. It took central banks some time to learn to operate successfully without the anchor of a fixed exchange rate, and partly for this reason inflation soared in the 1970s while economic activity stagnated. As central banks and governments came to recognize the critical importance of long-term price stability, inflation subsequently subsided. The fall in inflation coincided with a step-up in the pace of global economic integration, including in the past decade or more the increasing involvement of those economies in Asia and elsewhere. The question is whether that development has affected overall inflation and employment in industrial countries, and thus whether it may have changed the setting of monetary policy needed to maintain price stability and sustained high employment. The Implications for Inflation I have been struck recently by the contrast between the views reported in the media and views among academic economists on this issue of globalization and inflation. The media tend to concentrate on the increasing availability of cheap goods and competitive pressures on labor compensation as a continuing, pervasive check on inflationary tendencies in industrial economies. In contrast, just two weeks ago, I attended a conference of leading academic and central bank researchers on inflation hosted by the Federal Reserve Board, at which globalization was hardly mentioned. One modeler had tacked an import price variable onto the equations explaining U.S. inflation, but the rest simply ignored any developments beyond our borders. For a monetary policy practitioner, this disconnect raises a puzzle and some very basic concerns. A possible implication of the view in the media is that the inflation penalty for allowing economies to run a little "hotter" than normal--that is, a bit beyond an economic long-run sustainable output--could be quite small, if there is any penalty at all. The academic view implies that for the most part I can proceed with regard to inflation as if the United States is, to a first approximation, a closed economy. To act as if the outside world does not matter flies in the face of the major changes we have witnessed in recent decades. The advance of globalization has increased the range of goods and services available to be imported by U.S. households and firms and reduced the prices of many imported goods and services. In the case of consumer goods, these developments have directly held down the rate of increase of the imported-goods component of the consumer price index (CPI) and, thus, the rate of increase of the overall index; this direct effect on CPI inflation has risen over time as the import share of household spending has increased. Beyond this effect, falling prices for imported materials as well as capital equipment have reduced the production costs of U.S. firms, thereby indirectly restraining the growth of prices of domestically produced goods and services. Globalization has reinforced disinflation by intensifying the competitive pressures faced by U.S. firms and workers. For some firms, the actual or potential availability of less-expensive foreign goods has squeezed profit margins and may have intensified the firms' search for cost-saving productivity enhancements. For workers in some sectors, labor compensation has likely been restrained by the threat of jobs being shifted overseas to take advantage of lower production costs in the new trading nations, and this wage restraint in turn has helped to hold down domestic prices. How important have these direct and indirect price effects been? A precise answer to this question is beyond our abilities, but we can try to get a handle on the likely magnitude by using a simple reduced-form inflation equation of the sort employed by the Board's staff as an input into its inflation forecasts. This equation relates inflation to, among other factors, lagged inflation, resource utilization, and movements in the relative price of imports excluding energy, semiconductors, and computers. With it, we can simulate how core consumer prices would have been expected to evolve over the past ten years if relative import prices had remained constant--that is, had import prices gone up in line with those of domestically produced goods rather than rising approximately 1 percent per year slower on average, as actually occurred. The arithmetic of this exercise suggests that the decline in import prices since the mid-1990s has shaved between 1/2 and 1 percentage point off core inflation over the past ten years. But this arithmetic is just a useful starting point. Only part of this estimated effect can be chalked up to globalization per se. Some of the historical decline in import prices was probably driven by movements in the dollar's exchange rate largely unrelated to the growing integration of world markets. For example, the dollar rose strongly in the second half of the 1990s, when investment was attracted here by a pickup in productivity growth and profits. And relative import prices would have been likely to decline even in the absence of increased globalization, given the dominant role in trade of manufacturing, in which technological advances have put important restraint on prices. On the basis of these considerations, the contribution of globalization to low inflation in the United States in recent years has probably been appreciably smaller than the simple model simulation might suggest--although not necessarily inconsequential. In this regard, although direct empirical studies of the effect of an individual country's export prices on the United States are scarce, one recent study by the Board's staff concluded that lower prices of Chinese imports have had at most only modest effects on U.S. prices in recent years, although more-significant effects were recorded in a few specific categories. In addition, a focus on past declines in the prices of imported products is only part of the story of the effects of globalization on inflation in this country. Globalization and the integration of the newly emerging market economies have implications for the demand for goods and services as well as for their supply. By raising the purchasing power of incomes in industrial countries, trade increases the spending of their residents. Perhaps more consequentially, as trade theory, trade models, and recent experience suggest is likely to occur, new global traders are adding significant demand as well--especially for energy, basic commodities, and capital goods. For example, between 2000 and 2004, increases in Chinese steel consumption are estimated to have accounted for two-thirds of the increase in global steel demand. In fact, historically, industrializing countries have often raised global demand more than supply. Somewhat surprisingly, however, a number of these countries are currently producing more than they are spending. Their trade accounts tend to be in surplus, in some cases substantially, an indication that they are supplying more goods into the global economy than they are demanding. Part of the explanation for the tendency toward trade surpluses may be that household saving rates in many emerging-market economies have been quite high, possibly because of such factors as caution regarding debt accumulation; uncertainty about government support for retirement, health care, or education; or simply a lack of opportunity to spend. These elevated saving rates may also reflect the consequences of domestic financial markets that are not fully functional: If borrowing is expensive or simply unavailable, households will be unable to tap expected future earnings to finance the purchases of cars and other long-lived durable goods but instead will need to postpone spending until they have accumulated the necessary cash. Over time, one would expect the national savings surpluses of these newly integrating economies to decrease or even turn into deficits as opportunities to invest at home come to seem more profitable than placing savings abroad and as the desire of their residents to consume their rising wealth intensifies. As part of this adjustment process, the currencies of these countries would be expected to appreciate over time. Rising exchange rates, reflecting increasing productivity and real incomes, would help to reduce the countries' trade surpluses in two ways: Exports to industrial economies would no longer enjoy as large a price advantage and, obviously, would exert less downward pressure on inflation in those economies; and the demand for imports by the developing countries would rise. For a variety of reasons, some emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressures on their exchange rates, even if that resistance requires buying large quantities of dollars to keep their currencies from appreciating. But changes in exchange rates will be helpful in enabling them to adapt to rapidly changing internal and external developments while maintaining economic stability, and their recognition of that advantage should continue to lead to greater flexibility. I expect to be as correct in that prediction as I was in my 1964 IS thesis, recognizing of course that the lags can be long and variable. Meanwhile, less than fully flexible exchange rates are probably contributing to the surpluses of these economies and to their disinflationary effect on the rest of the world. Taking all these factors into account, where do I come out on the question of how recent trends in globalization have affected inflation in the United States and other industrial countries? On balance, under current circumstances, the entry of China, India, and others into the global trading system is probably having a modest disinflationary effect here. But it is neither large nor inevitable. If some fundamental conditioning factors were to change--for example, if these countries' exchange rates were to rise and their demand to increase--different spending patterns that could reduce the degree of downward pressure on prices might emerge. In fact, we cannot rule out the possibility that globalization might some day even create inflationary pressures on balance. The Implications for Productivity, Potential Output, and the NAIRU If globalization is having a modest but persistent downward effect on U.S. inflation, what about its effects on employment, the other component of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate? Here, I think the answer is clearer: An expansion of trade does not impinge on an economy's ability to create jobs and operate at its potential, given time for any temporary sectoral disruptions to be worked out. The logic behind this claim is Ricardo's classic observation that, even if one economy could produce every good and service less expensively than another economy, in a trading world it could not and would not become a seller of everything. Instead, every economy benefits by specializing in producing those goods in which it has a comparative efficiency advantage. Thus, as trade expands, even high-cost economies will see jobs become available in those industries in which they are comparatively more efficient. To be sure, a major increase in job turnover as a consequence of expanding trade, with the attendant shifting of resources from one industry to another, could make it harder to match jobs and people, especially if the people losing jobs failed to meet the skill requirements of the sectors gaining jobs. This job-worker mismatch might for a time tend to raise the economy's sustainable nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). But globalization-related job losses, even with rather generous estimates, are modest compared with the massive amount of job destruction and creation that takes place continuously in the United States in the normal course of the economy. As a result, the aggregate labor market readily absorbs such disruptions as those from trade, leaving overall employment little affected. That we now have an unemployment rate as low as 5 percent, and have sustained that rate without an appreciable pickup of underlying inflation, is evidence that our economy's ability to provide jobs on a sustained basis has not been impaired. Although globalization should have little effect on aggregate employment and the NAIRU, international trade does expand the economy's productive potential. By enabling a country to concentrate on producing those goods and services in which it is most efficient, an expansion of trade boosts the productivity of domestic labor and capital, permanently raising the level of potential output. Moreover, the heightened competitive environment fostered by an increasingly global trading system, as I noted earlier, may force firms to be more innovative, further boosting the level, and perhaps even the growth rate, of productivity. The expansion in aggregate supply and national income implied by these forces in turn leads to a corresponding rise in aggregate demand; in particular, households are able to increase their standard of living by consuming more goods and services, both imported and domestic. And it is the balance between potential supply and aggregate demand that concerns monetary policy. The Implications for Monetary Policy Globalization in its latest manifestations does not relieve central banks of their responsibility for maintaining price and economic stability. Inflation can be affected by a number of factors in the short run, but over time it will be determined by the interactions of aggregate demand, potential supply, and the expectations of businesses and households about future inflation. Through their control over the amount of bank reserves in the financial system and short-term interest rates, central banks can influence the balance of demand and potential supply, and their actions may also have direct effects on inflation expectations over time. Over the long run, the central bank has full responsibility for determining the economy's average rate of inflation. How the forces of demand, potential supply, and expectations interact has probably not been changed in any fundamental way by the recent trend of globalization. To be sure, the integration of newly industrializing economies into the global trading system is exerting downward pressure on costs and prices. But the effect on inflation--the rate of change in prices--has probably not been large to date, and the extent and duration of its damping influence on inflation in the future are open questions. Inflation will still rise if central banks allow economies to run "too hot"--beyond sustainable potential--and such a pickup could become self-perpetuating if it became embedded in inflation expectations. True, the specialization and efficiencies resulting from expanding trade enlarge potential supply by increasing productivity, enabling an increase in actual consumption and investment. But, so far, the evidence does not suggest that they have materially raised or lowered the extent of resource utilization associated with the economy producing at its sustainable potential. However, the integration of national economies in the global economic system does leave them more open to influences from abroad. And this integration could manifest itself in the interest rates the Federal Reserve needs to implement to keep the economy growing at its potential. For example, the increasing integration of global capital markets has facilitated the investment of the current high volume of world savings in dollar assets. The result has been lower interest rates here along with a stronger dollar, as well as a larger U.S. current account deficit than probably could have been sustained fifteen or twenty years ago. And the dynamics of the economy's response to policy has been affected by globalization. In one sense, an open economy may be more forgiving as shortfalls or excesses in demand are partly absorbed by other countries through adjustments of our imports and exports. To the extent that the U.S. can more readily draw upon world capacity, the inflationary effect of an increase in aggregate demand might be damped. But from another perspective, integrated economies and financial markets can also exert powerful feedback, which may be less forgiving of any perceived policy error. For example, if financial market participants thought that the Federal Reserve were not dedicated to maintaining long-run price stability, they would be less willing to hold dollar-denominated assets and the resulting decline in the exchange value of the dollar would tend to add to inflationary pressures. Overall, the ability of producers, consumers, and investors to shift purchases and resources provides rapid feedback on perceptions of policy--and not only in the monetary sphere. The need to compete for business in a globalized economy has quite likely raised the efficiency and flexibility of economic systems as well as reinforcing the requirement for noninflationary monetary policies. Globalization is a powerful force that raises productivity and living standards. To realize its benefits fully, however, many of us are being required to adapt in various ways. Globalization has made my job more interesting but no easier. As I said at the outset, I feel I have barely scratched the surface of the interactions of globalization and monetary policy. It is still early in the school year. If any seniors out there are still looking for an IS topic, see me after this talk. Footnotes 1.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Economic flexibility Before the National Italian American Foundation, Washington, D.C. October 12, 2005 It is a pleasure once again to speak before the National Italian American Foundation. I have long since been awarded the status of honorary Italian, for which I am sincerely appreciative. In my more than eighteen years at the Federal Reserve, much has surprised me, but nothing more than the remarkable ability of our economy to absorb and recover from the shocks of stock market crashes, credit crunches, terrorism, and hurricanes--blows that would have almost certainly precipitated deep recessions in decades past. This resilience, not evident except in retrospect, owes to a remarkable increase in economic flexibility, partly the consequence of deliberate economic policy and partly the consequence of innovations in information technology. A couple of weeks ago, I outlined to a convention of fellow economists how I believe this all came about. I should like to share some of those views with you this morning. For this country's first century and a half, government was only peripherally engaged in what we currently term the management of aggregate demand. Any endeavor to alter the path of private economic activity through active intervention would have been deemed inappropriate and, more important, unnecessary. In one of the more notable coincidences of history, our Declaration of Independence was signed the same year in which Adam Smith published his Wealth of Nations . Smith's prescription of letting markets prevail with minimal governmental interference became the guiding philosophy of American leadership for much of our history. With a masterful insight into the workings of the free-market institutions that were then emerging, Smith postulated an "invisible hand" in which competitive behavior drove an economy's resources toward their fullest and most efficient use. Economic growth and prosperity, he argued, would emerge if governments stood aside and allowed markets to work. Indeed, within a very few decades, free-market capitalism became the prevailing stance of most governments' economic policy, even if it was often implemented imperfectly. This framework withstood the conceptual onslaughts of Robert Owen's utopians, Karl Marx's communists and later, the Fabian socialists. The free-market paradigm came under more-vigorous attack after the collapse of the world's major economies in the 1930s. As the global depression deepened, the seeming failure of competitive markets to restore full employment perplexed economists until John Maynard Keynes offered an explanation that was to influence policy practitioners for generations to come. He argued that, contrary to the tenets of Smith and his followers, market systems did not always converge to full employment. They often appeared to settle at an equilibrium in which significant segments of the workforce were unable to find jobs. In the place of Smith's laissez-faire approach arose the view that government action was required to restore full employment and to rectify what were seen as other deficiencies of market-driven outcomes. A tidal wave of regulation soon swept over much of the American business community. Labor relations, securities markets, banking, agricultural pricing, and many other segments of the U.S. economy became subject to the oversight of government. The apparent success of the economy during World War II, which operated at full employment in contrast to the earlier frightening developments during the Depression years, led to a considerable reluctance to fully dismantle wartime regulations when the hostilities came to an end. However, cracks in the facade of government economic management appeared early in the post-World War II years, and those cracks continued to widen as time passed. At the macro level, the system of wage and price controls imposed in the 1970s to deal with the problem of inflation proved unworkable and ineffective. And at the micro level, heavy regulation of many industries was increasingly seen as impeding efficiency and competitiveness. By the early 1980s, the long-prevalent notion that the centrally planned economy of the Soviet Union was catching up with the West had begun to be discredited, though it was not fully discarded until the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 exposed the economic ruin behind the Iron Curtain. Starting in the 1970s, U.S. Presidents, supported by bipartisan majorities in the Congress, responded to the growing recognition of the distortions created by regulation, by deregulating large segments of the transportation, communications, energy, and financial services industries. The stated purpose of this deregulation was to enhance competition, which had come to be seen as a significant spur to productivity growth and elevated standards of living. Assisting in the dismantling of economic restraints was the persistent, albeit slow, lowering of barriers to cross-border trade and finance. As a consequence, the United States, then widely seen as a once-great economic power that had lost its way, gradually moved back to the forefront of what Joseph Schumpeter, the renowned Harvard professor, had called "creative destruction"--the continual scrapping of old technologies to make way for the innovative. In that paradigm, standards of living rise because depreciation and other cash flows of industries employing older, increasingly obsolescent technologies are marshaled, along with new savings, to finance the production of capital assets that almost always embody cutting-edge technologies. Workers, of necessity, migrate with the capital. Through this process, wealth is created, incremental step by incremental step, as high levels of productivity associated with innovative technologies displace less-efficient productive capacity. The model presupposes the continuous churning of a flexible competitive economy in which the new displaces the old. As the 1980s progressed, the success of that strategy confirmed the earlier views that a loosening of regulatory restraint on business would improve the flexibility of our economy. No specific program encompassed and coordinated initiatives to enhance flexibility, but there was a growing recognition that a market economy could best withstand and recover from shocks when provided maximum flexibility. Beyond deregulation, innovative technologies, especially information technologies, have contributed critically to enhanced flexibility. A quarter-century ago, for example, companies often required weeks to discover the emergence of inventory imbalances, allowing production to continue to exacerbate the excess. Excessive stockbuilding, in turn, necessitated a deeper decline in output than would have been necessary had the knowledge of the status of inventories been fully current. The advent of innovative information technologies significantly shortened the reporting lag, enabling flexible real-time responses to emerging imbalances. Deregulation and the newer information technologies have joined, in the United States and elsewhere, to advance flexibility in the financial sector. Financial stability may turn out to have been the most important contributor to the evident significant gains in economic stability over the past two decades. Historically, banks have been at the forefront of financial intermediation, in part because their ability to leverage offers an efficient source of funding. But in periods of severe financial stress, such leverage too often brought down banking institutions and, in some cases, precipitated financial crises that led to recession or worse. But recent regulatory reform, coupled with innovative technologies, has stimulated the development of financial products, such as asset-backed securities, collateral loan obligations, and credit default swaps, that facilitate the dispersion of risk. Conceptual advances in pricing options and other complex financial products, along with improvements in computer and telecommunications technologies, have significantly lowered the costs of, and expanded the opportunities for, hedging risks that were not readily deflected in earlier decades. The new instruments of risk dispersal have enabled the largest and most sophisticated banks, in their credit-granting role, to divest themselves of much credit risk by passing it to institutions with far less leverage. Insurance companies, especially those in reinsurance, pension funds, and hedge funds continue to be willing, at a price, to supply credit protection. These increasingly complex financial instruments have contributed to the development of a far more flexible, efficient, and hence resilient financial system than the one that existed just a quarter-century ago. After the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000, unlike previous periods following large financial shocks, no major financial institution defaulted, and the economy held up far better than many had anticipated. If we have attained a degree of flexibility that can mitigate most significant shocks--a proposition as yet not fully tested--the performance of the economy will be improved and the job of macroeconomic policymakers will be made much simpler. Governments today, although still far more activist than in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, are rediscovering the benefits of competition and the resilience to economic shocks that it fosters. We are also beginning to recognize an international version of Smith's invisible hand in the globalization of economic forces. Whether by intention or by happenstance, many, if not most, governments in recent decades have been relying more and more on the forces of the marketplace and reducing their intervention in market outcomes. We appear to be revisiting Adam Smith's notion that the more flexible an economy, the greater its ability to self-correct after inevitable, often unanticipated disturbances. That greater tendency toward self-correction has made the cyclical stability of the economy less dependent on the actions of macroeconomic policymakers, whose responses often have come too late or have been misguided. It is important to remember that most adjustment of a market imbalance is well under way before the imbalance becomes widely identified as a problem. Individual prices, exchange rates, and interest rates, adjust incrementally in real time to restore balance. In contrast, administrative or policy actions that await clear evidence of imbalance are of necessity late. Being able to rely on markets to do the heavy lifting of adjustment is an exceptionally valuable policy asset. The impressive performance of the U.S. economy over the past couple of decades, despite shocks that in the past would have surely produced marked economic contraction, offers the clearest evidence of the benefits of increased market flexibility. We weathered a decline on October 19, 1987, of a fifth of the market value of U.S. equities with little evidence of subsequent macroeconomic stress--an episode that hinted at a change in adjustment dynamics. The credit crunch of the early 1990s and the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000 were absorbed with the shallowest recessions in the post-World War II period. And the economic fallout from the tragic events of September 11, 2001, was moderated by market forces, with severe economic weakness evident for only a few weeks. Most recently, the flexibility of our market-driven economy has allowed us, thus far, to weather reasonably well the steep rise in spot and futures prices for oil and natural gas that we have experienced over the past two years. The consequence has been a far more stable economy. * * * Flexibility is most readily achieved by fostering an environment of maximum competition. A key element in creating this environment is flexible labor markets. Many working people, regrettably, equate labor market flexibility with job insecurity. Despite that perception, flexible labor policies appear to promote job creation, not destroy it. An increased capacity of management to discharge workers without excessive cost, for example, apparently increases companies' willingness to hire without fear of unremediable mistakes. The net effect, to the surprise of most, has been what appears to be a decline in the structural unemployment rate in the United States. Protectionism in all its guises, both domestic and international, does not contribute to the welfare of American workers. At best, it is a short-term fix at a cost of lower standards of living for the nation as a whole. We need increased education and training for those displaced by creative destruction, not a stifling of competition. A consequence of our highly competitive, rapidly growing economy is that the average American will hold many different jobs in a lifetime. Accordingly, education is no longer the sole province of the young. Significant numbers of workers continue their education well beyond their twenties. Millions enroll in community colleges in later life, for example, to upgrade their skills or get new ones. It is a measure of the dynamism of the U.S. economy that community colleges are one of the fastest growing segments of our educational system. * * * Moving forward, I trust that we have learned durable lessons about the benefits of fostering and preserving a flexible economy. That flexibility has been the product of the economic dynamism of our workers and firms that was unleashed, in part, by the efforts of policymakers to remove rigidities and promote competition. Although the business cycle has not disappeared, flexibility has made the economy more resilient to shocks and more stable overall during the past couple of decades. To be sure, that stability, by fostering speculative excesses, has created some new challenges for policymakers. But more fundamentally, an environment of greater economic stability has been key to the impressive growth in the standards of living and economic welfare so evident in the United States.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Energy Before the Japan Business Federation, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, Tokyo, Japan October 17, 2005 Even before the devastating hurricanes of August and September 2005, world oil markets had been subject to a degree of strain not experienced for a generation. Increased demand and lagging additions to productive capacity had eliminated a significant amount of the slack in world oil markets that had been essential in containing crude oil and product prices between 1985 and 2000. In such tight markets, the shutdown of oil platforms and refineries last month by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita was an accident waiting to happen. In their aftermath, prices of crude oil worldwide moved sharply higher, and with refineries stressed by a shortage of capacity, margins for refined products in the United States roughly doubled. Prices of natural gas soared as well. Oil prices had been persistently edging higher since 2002 as increases in global oil consumption progressively absorbed the buffer of several million barrels a day in excess capacity that stood between production and demand. Any pickup in consumption or shortfall in production for a commodity as price inelastic in the short run as oil was bound to be immediately reflected in a spike in prices. Such a price spike effectively represented a tax that drained purchasing power from oil consumers. Although the global economic expansion appears to have been on a reasonably firm path through the summer months, the recent surge in energy prices will undoubtedly be a drag from now on. In the United States, Japan, and elsewhere, the effect on growth would have been greater had oil not declined in importance as an input to world economic activity since the 1970s. How did we arrive at a state in which the balance of world energy supply and demand could be so fragile that weather, not to mention individual acts of sabotage or local insurrection, could have a significant impact on economic growth? Even so large a weather event as August and September's hurricanes, had they occurred in earlier decades of ample oil capacity, would have had hardly noticeable effects on crude prices if producers placed their excess supplies on the market or on product prices if idle refinery capacity were activated. The history of the world petroleum industry is one of a rapidly growing industry seeking the stable prices that have been seen by producers as essential to the expansion of the market. In the early twentieth century, pricing power was firmly in the hands of Americans, predominately John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil. Reportedly appalled by the volatility of crude oil prices that stunted the growth of oil markets in the early years of the petroleum industry, Rockefeller had endeavored with some success to stabilize those prices by gaining control by the turn of the century of nine-tenths of U.S. refining capacity. But even after the breakup of the Standard Oil monopoly in 1911, pricing power remained with the United States--first with the U.S. oil companies and later with the Texas Railroad Commission, which raised limits on output to suppress price spikes and cut output to prevent sharp price declines. Indeed, as late as 1952, crude oil production in the United States (44 percent of which was in Texas) still accounted for more than half of the world total. Excess Texas crude oil capacity was notably brought to bear to contain the impact on oil prices of the nationalization of Iranian oil a half-century ago. Again, excess American oil was released to the market to counter the price pressures induced by the Suez crisis of 1956 and the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. Of course, concentrated control in the hands of a few producers over any resource can pose potential problems. In the event, that historical role ended in 1971, when excess crude oil capacity in the United States was finally absorbed by rising world demand. At that point, the marginal pricing of oil, which for so long had been under the control of international oil companies, predominantly American, abruptly shifted to a few large Middle East producers and to greater market forces than those that they and the other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) could contain. To capitalize on their newly acquired pricing power, many producing nations, especially in the Middle East, nationalized their oil companies. But the full magnitude of the pricing power of the nationalized oil companies became evident only in the aftermath of the oil embargo of 1973. During that period, posted crude oil prices at Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia, rose to more than $11 per barrel, a level significantly above the $1.80 per barrel that had been unchanged from 1961 to 1970. The further surge in oil prices that accompanied the Iranian Revolution in 1979 eventually drove up prices to $39 per barrel by February 1981 ($75 per barrel in today's prices). The higher prices of the 1970s abruptly ended the extraordinary growth of U.S. and world consumption of oil and the increased intensity of its use that was so evident in the decades immediately following World War II. Since the more than tenfold increase in crude oil prices between 1972 and 1981, world oil consumption per real dollar equivalent of global gross domestic product (GDP) has declined by approximately one-third. In the United States, between 1945 and 1973, consumption of petroleum products rose at a startling average annual rate of 4-1/2 percent, well in excess of growth of our real GDP. However, between 1973 and 2004, oil consumption grew in the United States, on average, at only 1/2 percent per year, far short of the rise in real GDP. In consequence, the ratio of U.S. oil consumption to GDP fell by half. Much of the decline in the ratio of oil use to real GDP in the United States has resulted from growth in the proportion of GDP composed of services, high-tech goods, and other presumably less oil-intensive industries. Additionally, part of the decline in this ratio is due to improved energy conservation for a given set of economic activities, including greater home insulation, better gasoline mileage, more efficient machinery, and streamlined production processes. These trends have been ongoing but have likely intensified of late with the sharp, recent increases in oil prices. In Japan, which until recently was the world's second largest oil consumer, the growth of demand was also strong before the developments of the 1970s. Subsequently, shocked by the increase in prices and without indigenous production to cushion the effects on incomes, Japan sharply curtailed the growth of its oil use, reducing the ratio of oil consumption to GDP by about half as well. Although the production quotas of OPEC have been a significant factor in price determination for a third of a century, the story since 1973 has been as much about the power of markets as it has been about power over markets. The incentives to alter oil consumption provided by market prices eventually resolved even the most seemingly insurmountable difficulties posed by inadequate supply outside the OPEC cartel. Many observers feared that the gap projected between supply and demand in the immediate post-1973 period would be so large that rationing would be the only practical solution. But the resolution did not occur that way. In the United States, to be sure, mandated fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks induced the slower growth of gasoline demand. Some observers argue, however, that, even without government-enforced standards, market forces would have led to increased fuel efficiency. Indeed, the number of small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars that were imported into U.S. markets rose throughout the 1970s as the price of oil moved higher. Moreover, at that time, prices were expected to go still higher. For example, the U.S. Department of Energy in 1979 had projections showing real oil prices reaching nearly $60 per barrel by 1995--the equivalent of more than $120 in today's prices. The failure of oil prices to rise as projected in the late 1970s is a testament to the power of markets and the technologies they foster. Today, the average price of crude oil, despite its recent surge, is still in real terms below the price peak of February 1981. Moreover, since oil use, as I noted, is only two-thirds as important an input into world GDP as it was three decades ago, the effect of the current surge in oil prices, though noticeable, is likely to prove significantly less consequential to economic growth and inflation than the surge in the 1970s. The petroleum industry's early years of hit-or-miss exploration and development of oil and gas has given way to a more systematic, high-tech approach. The dramatic changes in technology in recent years have made existing oil and natural gas reserves stretch further while keeping energy costs lower than they otherwise would have been. Seismic imaging and advanced drilling techniques are facilitating the discovery of promising new reservoirs and are enabling the continued development of mature fields. Accordingly, one might expect that the cost of developing new fields and, hence, the long-term price of new oil and gas would have declined. And, indeed, these costs have declined, though less than they might otherwise have done. Much of the innovation in oil development outside OPEC, for example, has been directed at overcoming an increasingly inhospitable and costly exploratory environment, the consequence of more than a century of draining the more immediately accessible sources of crude oil. Still, consistent with declining long-term marginal costs of extraction, distant futures prices for crude oil moved lower, on net, during the 1990s. The most-distant futures prices fell from a bit more than $20 per barrel before the first Gulf War to less than $18 a barrel on average in 1999. Such long-term price stability has eroded noticeably over the past five years. Between 1991 and 2000, although spot prices ranged between $11 and $35 per barrel, distant futures exhibited little variation. Since then, distant futures prices have risen sharply. In early August, prices for delivery in 2011 of light sweet crude breached $60 per barrel, in line with recent increases in spot prices. This surge arguably reflects the growing presumption that increases in crude oil capacity outside OPEC will no longer be adequate to serve rising world demand going forward, especially from emerging Asia. Additionally, the longer-term crude price has presumably been driven up by renewed fears of supply disruptions in the Middle East and elsewhere. But the opportunities for profitable exploration and development in the industrial economies are dwindling, and the international oil companies are currently largely prohibited, restricted, or face considerable political risk in investing in OPEC and other developing countries. In such a highly profitable market environment for oil producers, one would have expected a far greater surge of oil investments. Indeed, some producers have significantly ratcheted up their investment plans. But because of the geographic concentration of proved reserves, much of the investment in crude oil productive capacity required to meet demand, without prices rising unduly, will need to be undertaken by national oil companies in OPEC and other developing economies. Although investment is rising, the significant proportion of oil revenues invested in financial assets suggests that many governments perceive that the benefits of investing in additional capacity to meet rising world oil demand are limited. Moreover, much oil revenue has been diverted to meet the perceived high-priority needs of rapidly growing populations. Unless those policies, political institutions, and attitudes change, it is difficult to envision adequate reinvestment into the oil facilities of these economies. Besides feared shortfalls in crude oil capacity, the status of world refining has become worrisome as well. Crude oil production has been rising faster than refining capacity over the past decade. A continuation of this trend would soon make lack of refining capacity the binding constraint on growth in oil use. This may already be happening in certain grades, given the growing mismatch between the heavier and more sour content of world crude oil production and the rising world demand for lighter, sweeter petroleum products. There is thus an especial need to add adequate coking and desulphurization capacity to convert the average gravity and sulphur content of much of the world's crude oil to the lighter and sweeter needs of product markets, which are increasingly dominated by transportation fuels that must meet ever more stringent environmental requirements. Yet the expansion and the modernization of world refineries are lagging. For example, no new refinery has been built in the United States since 1976. The consequence of lagging modernization is reflected in a significant widening of the price spread between the higher priced light sweet crudes such as Brent and the heavier crudes such as Maya. To be sure, refining capacity continues to expand, albeit gradually, and exploration and development activities are ongoing, even in developed industrial countries. Conversion of the vast Athabasca oil sands reserves in Alberta to productive capacity, while slow, has made this unconventional source of oil highly competitive at current market prices. However, despite improved technology and high prices, proved reserves in the developed countries are being depleted because additions to these reserves have not kept pace with production. * * * The production, demand, and price outlook for oil beyond the current market turbulence will doubtless continue to reflect longer-term concerns. Much will depend on the response of demand to price over the longer run. If history is any guide, should higher prices persist, energy use over time will continue to decline relative to GDP. In the wake of sharply higher prices, the oil intensity of the U.S. economy, as I pointed out earlier, has been reduced by about half since the early 1970s. Much of that displacement was achieved by 1985. Progress in reducing oil intensity has continued since then, but at a lessened pace. For example, after the initial surge in the fuel efficiencies of our light motor vehicles during the 1980s, reflecting the earlier run-up in oil prices, improvements have since slowed to a trickle. The more-modest rate of decline in the energy intensity of the U.S. economy after 1985 should not be surprising, given the generally lower level of real oil prices that have prevailed since then. With real energy prices again on the rise, more-rapid decreases in the intensity of energy use in the years ahead seem virtually inevitable. Long-term demand elasticities over the past three decades have proved noticeably higher than those evident in the short term. Indeed, gasoline consumption has declined markedly in the United States in recent weeks, presumably partly as a consequence of higher prices. * * * Altering the magnitude and manner of energy consumption will significantly affect the path of the global economy over the long term. For years, long-term prospects for oil and natural gas prices appeared benign. When choosing capital projects, businesses in the past could mostly look through short-run fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, with an anticipation that moderate prices would prevail over the longer haul. The recent shift in expectations, however, has been substantial enough and persistent enough to direct business-investment decisions in favor of energy-cost reduction. Over the past decade, energy consumed, measured in British thermal units, per real dollar of gross nonfinancial, non-energy corporate product in the United States has declined substantially, and this trend may be expected to accelerate in coming years. In Japan, as well, energy use has declined as a fraction of GDP, but these savings were largely achieved in previous decades, and energy intensity has been flat more recently. We can expect similar increases in oil efficiency in the rapidly growing economies of East Asia as they respond to the same set of market incentives. But at present, China consumes roughly twice as much oil per dollar of GDP as the United States, and if, as projected, its share of world GDP continues to increase, the average improvements in world oil-intensity will be less pronounced than the improvements in individual countries, viewed separately, would suggest. * * * We cannot judge with certainty how technological possibilities will play out in the future, but we can say with some assurance that developments in energy markets will remain central in determining the longer-run health of our nations' economies. The experience of the past fifty years--and indeed much longer than that--affirms that market forces play a key role in conserving scarce energy resources, directing those resources to their most highly valued uses. However, the availability of adequate productive capacity will also be driven by nonmarket influences and by other policy considerations. To be sure, energy issues present policymakers with difficult tradeoffs to consider. The concentration of oil reserves in politically volatile areas of the world is an ongoing concern. But that concern and others, one hopes, will be addressed in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, does not distort or stifle the meaningful functioning of our markets. Barring political impediments to the operation of markets, the same price signals that are so critical for balancing energy supply and demand in the short run also signal profit opportunities for long-term supply expansion. Moreover, they stimulate the research and development that will unlock new approaches to energy production and use that we can now only barely envision. Improving technology and ongoing shifts in the structure of economic activity are reducing the energy intensity of industrial countries, and presumably recent oil price increases will accelerate the pace of displacement of energy-intensive production facilities. If history is any guide, oil will eventually be overtaken by less-costly alternatives well before conventional oil reserves run out. Indeed, oil displaced coal despite still vast untapped reserves of coal, and coal displaced wood without denuding our forest lands. New technologies to more fully exploit existing conventional oil reserves will emerge in the years ahead. Moreover, innovation is already altering the power source of motor vehicles, and much research is directed at reducing gasoline requirements. We will begin the transition to the next major sources of energy, perhaps before midcentury, as production from conventional oil reservoirs, according to central-tendency scenarios of the U.S. Department of Energy, is projected to peak. In fact, the development and application of new sources of energy, especially nonconventional sources of oil, is already in train. Nonetheless, the transition will take time. We, and the rest of the world, doubtless will have to live with the geopolitical and other uncertainties of the oil markets for some time to come.

Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. To the Metropolitan Trenton African American Chamber of Commerce, Trenton, New Jersey October 18, 2005 Economic Outlook for the United States I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today about the outlook for the U. S. economy. As always, the views that I will be expressing are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve. To jump right to the bottom line, I believe that the outlook for the economy remains solid despite the devastating blows delivered to the Gulf Coast by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These storms obviously took their horrible toll on lives and property. Nonetheless, the U.S. economy is remarkably flexible and resilient. The history of the past five years clearly shows that our economy was able to weather a series of significant shocks: the steep drop in equity prices, the terrorist attacks on September 11, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the corporate accounting scandals. And, although considerable uncertainties remain, I expect this resilience to be demonstrated again in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I do not in any way mean to minimize the challenges we face in the near term because of these storms. A major city has been shut down, and a large number of people there and elsewhere along the Gulf Coast have been displaced. In addition, businesses in the region have been destroyed and jobs lost. It will take time--certainly months, and maybe years--to get these communities back on their feet. The storms also hit key parts of the nation's energy infrastructure. The resulting curtailment in the availability of crude oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products has led to sharply higher prices for these fuels, which has eroded the purchasing power of consumers throughout the nation. But the Congress has approved $62 billion in supplemental spending for hurricane relief and reconstruction, which should help to cushion the negative effects in the near term and stimulate economic activity over time as rebuilding accelerates. In addition, households and businesses will find ways to adjust to higher energy prices, as they have done in the past. In my remarks today, I'd first like to discuss where the economy was headed before the storms hit. Then I will describe a framework for assessing the likely economic effect of the hurricanes. Obviously a great deal of uncertainty surrounds such an assessment, but it is a necessary first step to updating the economic outlook after the storms. Finally, I would like to talk about the macroeconomic consequences of sharply higher energy prices that, if futures markets are an accurate guide, appear likely to persist long after rebuilding has been completed. The Economy Before the Hurricanes Before the hurricanes, economic activity appeared to have had considerable near-term momentum. Payroll employment continued to increase through August, and other indicators suggested that further gains in production and sales were in train during July and August. Consumer spending was growing briskly despite rapidly rising energy prices. Sales of light motor vehicles were especially robust--the result of the "employee pricing" plans offered by the major automakers. New residential construction remained at or near historically high levels through the summer, as did home sales. In contrast, business investment appeared to have lost a bit of steam. On net, real gross domestic product (GDP) looked likely to accelerate somewhat in the third and fourth quarters from the 3-1/2 percent annual rate registered in the first half of the year. On the price side of the ledger, consumer price inflation was moving up in response to the direct effects of higher energy prices. Crude oil prices continued to rise before the storms hit as the growth in world demand for refined petroleum products further outstripped the growth of world supply. Meanwhile, the readings on core consumer price inflation--that is consumer price inflation excluding the direct effects of energy and food prices--had been favorable, coming in well below the more-elevated pace seen earlier in 2005. Of course, some of this slowdown in core price inflation was attributable to the temporary effects of the employee-pricing programs for light vehicles. And higher energy costs were expected to place continued upward pressure on the prices of other goods and services. In this environment of somewhat faster growth in aggregate spending and greater upward pressure on prices, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised its target for the federal funds rate to 3-1/2 percent in early August. At the same time, the Committee reiterated its belief that, with the appropriate monetary policy actions, the upside and downside risks to the outlook for sustainable economic growth and price stability were roughly equal and that the removal of monetary accommodation could proceed at a "measured pace." Thus, before the hurricanes, the outlook was relatively benign: continued moderate economic growth accompanied by little change in the underlying pace of core inflation. There were, of course, risks in this forecast. The cumulative impact of the rise in energy prices on inflation and activity--a topic to which I will return shortly--was clearly one concern. So too was the ongoing rise in home prices and the possibility that this phenomenon is unsustainable. House prices have risen to levels that, in some areas of the country, seem high relative to the economic fundamentals. The market for second homes seems especially strong, raising the fear that some homeowners are speculating on further increases in home prices. The greater use of innovative forms of mortgage finance adds to the concern that the residential real estate market may well be vulnerable to a flattening of home prices, and in certain markets, perhaps a decline. I do not think that a significant and widespread drop in home prices is the most likely outcome, but the situation will require careful monitoring in the months ahead. A further risk is the apparent deceleration in business spending on new equipment and software (E&S). Real E&S outlays grew almost 14 percent last year, but the rate of increase thus far in 2005 has slipped into the single digits. Are businesses becoming more reluctant to invest? One answer to this question may be that the slowdown only reflects the usual noise in the investment data. Another possibility is that higher energy prices are discouraging investment by increasing the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for aggregate demand. Higher energy prices ought to boost investment as firms seek to replace their machines with new, more energy-efficient models, but this effect easily could be swamped by concerns about future weakness in the demand for their products. Given the importance of capital deepening for the growth of structural productivity and for increases in our long-run standard of living, this slowdown in the growth of equipment investment also bears watching. The Economic Effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita I'd now like to turn to the economic effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. On the one hand, it is important to recognize that, besides causing enormous human tragedy, the hurricanes made the nation economically worse off. Not only did output fall as the result of the storms, but households lost their homes and possessions, businesses were damaged or destroyed, and key infrastructure was wiped out. Initial estimates of losses range anywhere from $50 billion to $150 billion. On the other hand, although these are very large losses in absolute terms, they represent only a tiny fraction of national net worth. Past natural disasters can serve as a rudimentary guide to the likely economic effects of the hurricanes, but the unique characteristics of these two storms--including the devastation of a major city and the displacement of its population--clearly put us in uncharted territory. Nonetheless, I think it is useful to think about a natural disaster as having three relatively distinct phases. In the first phase, production and sales decline in the affected area. In the second phase, activity bounces back as initial repairs are made to damaged infrastructure and the disruptions recede. In the third phase, rebuilding activity boosts production for a time, and real GDP can actually be higher than it would have been in the absence of the disaster. In the long run, once national saving has increased enough to restore the national net worth to its desired level, the effect of the disaster on economic activity essentially disappears. Obviously, the recoveries of the various communities and industries affected by the hurricanes will have different time profiles. For example, the need to drain New Orleans of water and clear it of any environmental hazards will slow the pace of its recovery relative to other areas that did not suffer from extreme flooding. But, I think that the bulk of the disruptions from the storms will be felt in the second half of this year. A significant portion of this effect results from the reduced output of oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products. Although the additional losses of energy production in the wake of Hurricane Rita are clearly a negative for growth, repair and recovery activities should pick up as we move through the fourth quarter. There are, of course, substantial uncertainties both about the actual dimension of the economic effects and about the abilities of our statistical systems to measure these effects. But the effects on the growth of real GDP in the second half of the year should be noticeable. In 2006, the recovery process is expected to contribute to the growth of real GDP. I should note that a key element in this recovery is the federal aid package, which provides some income support to evacuees and, in effect, finances a sizable portion of the reconstruction activity. Without this federal effort, the dislocations from the hurricanes likely would have a much greater negative effect on aggregate demand, and the rebuilding process would occur more slowly. At this point, it seems likely that the hurricanes had, at most, a small effect on the supply side of the economy. The losses of productive capital, while devastating in the regions directly affected, appear to be small relative to the overall size of the national capital stock. Moreover, at this time the dislocation of workers seems unlikely to be large or persistent enough relative to the size of our nation's labor force to significantly affect the natural rate of unemployment. This impression was reinforced by the employment report for September, which showed the pace of hurricane-related job losses to be considerably less that many analysts had feared. Of course, it is too early to put too much weight on any one observation about the economy after the hurricanes. The hurricanes have, however, adversely affected the outlook for inflation. The damage to production and refining facilities has significantly boosted the prices of natural gas and gasoline. Consumer energy prices are projected to rise substantially in the second half of this year, and some spillover into the prices of non-energy goods and services looks likely as well. The Macroeconomics of Higher Oil Prices In the absence of the hurricanes, the economy would still be coping with higher oil prices. From a level of $30 per barrel at the end of 2003, the spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil has risen to a range of $60 to $70 per barrel this year. This doubling of the nominal price of crude oil represents a significant shock to the economy. The effect may well be amplified in this instance because the higher prices are expected to be quite long lasting rather than temporary. In past episodes of rising spot prices, the prices of far-dated futures contracts indicated that oil market participants expected prices to eventually gravitate back to about $20 per barrel. In the current episode, far-dated futures prices have risen roughly in line with the spot price and currently stand at approximately $60 per barrel. In general, economists believe persistent changes in relative prices have a larger effect on economic activity than do temporary changes. When a price change is transitory, consumers tend to change their saving more than their spending. Similarly, business investment decisions typically reflect multiyear horizons, and transitory fluctuations in prices during that period are relatively unimportant. But more-permanent changes in relative prices elicit more-substantial adjustments on the part of both consumers and businesses. A large, long-lasting increase in the relative price of energy will affect inflation for a time. Although short-run swings in firms' energy costs might be absorbed in their profit margins, a persistent increase is likely to be fully passed on to the consumer. Such cost pressures could potentially feed back into wages as workers strive to maintain their real incomes. The behavior of inflation expectations is the key to such a feedback process. If expectations for long-run inflation become unanchored--that is, begin to rise persistently--the possibility of a wage-price spiral increases. However, if households and businesses believe that the central bank is committed to preserving price stability, the likelihood that inflation expectations will become unanchored decreases. Thus, the preservation of the credibility of the central bank's resolve to contain inflation is one of the key elements in the adjustment to a higher relative price of energy. An energy price shock is often likened to an income tax increase. Given that we import about twelve million barrels of crude oil and related products a day, a price increase of $30 per barrel translates into a $130 billion increase in the oil bill paid to foreigners. Like a tax increase, these added costs reduce the disposable income available to households to make purchases of other goods and services. Economists speak of consumers as basing their consumption spending on their "permanent" income--the inflation-adjusted income that they expect they can earn on a sustained basis over time. Clearly, a quite long-lasting increase in energy prices reduces this permanent income and, if all else remains the same, would reduce the level of consumer spending. Thus, as we saw in the 1970s and 1980s, in the near term households will adjust the thermostat and drive a bit less. However, over time they will tend to avoid products that use energy relatively intensively and will buy more fuel-efficient vehicles and home appliances. This substitution will mitigate somewhat, but not fully offset, the effects of higher energy prices on consumer spending. The reaction of the business sector to permanently higher energy prices is more complicated. As I noted earlier, high and volatile energy prices may increase the uncertainty of firms about the near-term course of aggregate demand and damp their investment spending. But over time, there are gains to be made by companies that can produce capital goods that are more energy efficient. Higher prices for energy-efficient capital should spur research and development in those industries, and over time, more energy-efficient equipment will become available for purchase. One need look only at the increase in orders for the latest generation of fuel-efficient jetliners for an example of this kind of innovation. Higher energy prices will force all firms to examine whether their production processes remain cost minimizing at the current set of relative prices. In an effort to lower the cost of production, firms tend, where possible, to substitute capital and labor for energy consumption. In the 1970s and 1980s, such substitution greatly reduced the amount of energy consumed in the business sector per unit of output. I'd expect to see a similar response to the latest price run-up in the years ahead. Some portions of the business capital stock may be made obsolete by higher energy costs. Facilities that are no longer profitable will be shut down. We already see an example of this in the airline industry, where increasingly airlines are eliminating unprofitable routes. We may see more such adjustments in other industries. Firms that use natural gas seem especially vulnerable at this time. Many plants that use natural gas as a feedstock were not designed to be profitable at the current level of natural gas prices. We have a limited capacity to increase our imports of liquefied natural gas at present. Hence, some companies are talking about moving their production facilities to overseas locations where the price of natural gas is lower than in the United States. Studies have shown that adjustments by households and businesses in response to higher energy prices reduce the long-run level of potential output in the economy. This reduction mainly reflects the tendency of production to become more labor intensive in response to the increase in the relative price of energy. In essence, labor productivity grows more slowly after an energy price shock and that effect lowers the trajectory for potential output. If higher energy prices induce scrappage of parts of the business capital stock, this would lower the growth of capital services and further lower the path for potential output. Up to this point, I have spoken qualitatively about how a permanent change in the relative price of energy affects the economy. Now I'd like to report on some simulations of the Board's FRB/US econometric model that attempt to quantify some of these effects. As with any model simulation, the results will depend on the structure of the model and a host of ancillary assumptions. However, in my view, the results are illustrative of the magnitude of the shock that we've experienced. We simulated FRB/US using the path for crude oil prices that futures market participants in December 2003 expected to prevail over the following three years. We also simulated the model with the revisions to futures prices that occurred subsequently over 2004 and through mid-September of this year. Based on a comparison of these simulations, we estimate that real GDP growth was held down 1/2 percentage point in 2004 and 1 percentage point this year relative to what it otherwise would have been. The drag on real GDP growth next year would be comparable to that in 2004. As higher energy prices are passed through to the prices of other goods and services, prices for core personal consumption expenditures (core PCE) are estimated by the model to have been boosted 1/4 percentage point last year and more than 1/2 percentage point in 2005. Given the lags in the inflation process, core PCE inflation rises a bit further relative to baseline next year. These are big effects, and they reinforce my earlier point about how resilient our economy has been to some very large shocks. We have continued to grow at a solid pace despite some very strong counter forces. What does all of this mean for the conduct of monetary policy? In my view, it reinforces the need for policy to continue to be dependent on the incoming data on output and prices and on our forecasts for how those variables will evolve over time. To understand longer-term trends, it is also important to recognize that the measurement of economic activity in the immediate aftermath of the hurricanes may give an incomplete picture. Since it began withdrawing monetary accommodation in June 2004, the FOMC has repeatedly stated that its future policy actions will be governed by the expected performance of the economy. Monetary accommodation can be withdrawn at a faster pace if inflation pressures seem to be building to a greater extent than expected. Likewise, if economic weakness emerges, the trajectory of policy could be appropriately adjusted for these circumstances. For now, I believe that our policy of removing monetary accommodation at a "measured" pace is most likely to promote our broader objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.
Remarks by Governor Donald L. Kohn At the 2006 Global Economic and Investment Outlook Conference, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania October 19, 2005 The Economic Outlook I appreciate this opportunity to discuss recent developments in the U.S economy and its prospects for the future. Overall, the outlook remains favorable for continued solid growth in real activity and low underlying inflation. To be sure, considerable uncertainties accompany that generally positive outlook. The most obvious include the economic effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, but those risks are by no means the only ones currently confronting us. For perspective, I thought it might be useful to start with a review of economic conditions in midsummer. I will then go on to discuss various influences on the outlook, including my assessment of the likely effects of the storms, and the implications of these developments for monetary policy. Finally, I will lay out some of the major risks in the economic outlook. I stress that these views are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Although economic growth slowed some this year from the pace in 2004, activity appeared to have been on a solid upward trajectory before the landfall of Hurricane Katrina. The rise in crude oil prices over 2004 and the first half of 2005--from about $30 per barrel to about $60 per barrel--undoubtedly was damping demand to some extent this summer. As a result of these increases, households were experiencing a hit to their real incomes as were those firms using energy; moreover, uncertainty about the effects of energy price increases on demand may have led businesses to become somewhat more cautious about capital spending. Nonetheless, growth in aggregate demand continued to be supported by accommodative financial conditions. Real interest rates--both short- and long-term--were still relatively low despite the gradual upward adjustment of the federal funds rate. Credit was readily available to households and businesses and on reasonably favorable terms. Lenders apparently were encouraged that an economic environment of steady growth and low core inflation would persist and would sustain gains in incomes and profits. In addition, households' wealth continued to be boosted by substantial increases in the prices of houses, bolstering spending on goods and services as well as on residential housing, including additions and improvements. Production did slow some over the spring and early summer, but largely because inventories outside the auto sector were accumulated less rapidly. Firms had built inventories at a rapid clip in 2004 and the first part of this year, and by late winter many businesses seemed to have been more satisfied with their inventory positions. Consequently, they scaled back rebuilding efforts and trimmed the growth of production accordingly. Still, activity rose rapidly enough to further erode margins of economic slack. The unemployment rate fell from 5.4 percent at the end of last year to 4.9 percent in August, and the rate of capacity utilization continued to rise toward its long-run average, though that increase was slowed with the production adjustment in the spring. Measures of labor compensation have given somewhat mixed signals about how tight labor markets have become. The rate of increase in the measure of compensation per hour derived from the national income and product accounts moved up appreciably over the four quarters ended in mid-2005 compared with the preceding year. This rise was apparently due in part to bonuses and stock options that may be only loosely related to labor market slack, however. Moreover, according to the employment cost index, which is based on a survey of firms, and to the growth in average hourly earnings in the payroll employment report, compensation pressures remained quite subdued. On balance, I do not believe conditions in labor markets have become excessively taut, but experience suggests remaining humble in making any such assessment. Measures of core consumer inflation eased some over the late spring and early summer, even as headline inflation was pushed higher by rising energy prices. In addition to the favorable news on core inflation, observations from the financial markets showed that forward measures of inflation compensation beyond the next few years--the difference between distant forward rates on nominal and indexed debt--moved down over the spring, despite the rising energy prices. Even so, core inflation had moved higher in 2004, interest rates were still low, and the economy seemed to be expanding at a pace that over time could threaten to impart added upward pressure on inflation. As a consequence, the FOMC indicated in its August announcement that its intention, in the absence of unexpected developments, was to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation at a measured pace. Hurricanes are obviously the very embodiments of unexpected developments. Among other effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, they have materially increased uncertainty about the economic outlook. The questions raised include the following: What will be the extent and duration of the disruption to economic activity in the Gulf Coast region? How fast will rebuilding occur, how much support will be available for rebuilding from various levels of government and how will it be funded? And how quickly will the energy infrastructure be brought back on stream? The answers to these questions will also influence two important additional questions for the national economy: What will be the time path of energy prices? And what will be the effects of the rise in retail energy prices on economywide spending and inflation? Unfortunately, this added uncertainty is not likely to be resolved anytime soon; Gulf Coast residents--both households and businesses--are assessing the damage; rebuilding plans and supporting government programs are just beginning to be put in place; large portions of the energy infrastructure remains shut down; and we are only starting to see the range of possible reactions to higher energy prices. Economic activity and prices will be affected for some time and discerning underlying trends will be difficult. It is not obvious that this form of uncertainty has implications for monetary policy, however. Pausing or slowing down a rise in policy interest rates would not itself help to reduce uncertainty because the way in which policy might affect spending or inflation is not in question. Rather this is a situation in which a central bank generally is well advised to make its best forecast, to evaluate the risks around that forecast as well as it can, and to act on that forecast and associated evaluation of risks. With regard to economic activity, my best guess is that the economy retains a good deal of forward momentum and that the evolution over time of the balance between aggregate demand and potential supply may not be greatly affected by the hurricanes and further rise in retail energy prices. In particular, the factors that were supporting the growth of activity through the first two-thirds of the year are still in place: Market interest rates remain relatively low and credit spreads narrow; underlying growth of productivity--the ultimate source of long-run gains in incomes and living standards--appears to be appreciable; and the rapid rise in house prices, which persisted through at least the first half of the year, has given households a reservoir of housing wealth that they can draw on to support spending. Of course, several hurricane-related forces will be restraining consumer demand in the near term, including the loss of jobs and income by displaced workers; the effect of the rise in energy prices on disposable incomes, especially through the winter heating season; and perhaps the increase in uncertainty itself, which could make both households and businesses more cautious about spending. Households do appear to be responding to higher energy prices--driving less and favoring more fuel-efficient vehicles, for example--and overall the growth of consumer spending has slowed from the pace late last year and earlier this year. However, futures prices for crude oil and wholesale gasoline suggest that some portion of the post-hurricane increase in retail energy prices is likely to reverse over coming quarters. Moreover, rebuilding efforts in the Gulf Coast will gain momentum over time--aided by considerable government support--and the pick up in activity will boost spending and employment next year from their currently depressed levels. Looking through the effects of the hurricanes, I would expect some slowing in the rates of increase of consumer spending over time in response to higher interest rates and a less ebullient housing market. We have some indications that housing markets are cooling off, although the signs are scattered and mostly anecdotal. A substantial slowing in the pace of house-price appreciation seems inevitable as prices reach high levels relative to interest rates, rents, and incomes. And such a slowdown would tend to cause households to restrain their spending somewhat because they would need to save more out of current income in order to build wealth. In my view, these developments--housing markets coming off the boil and an accompanying gradual rise in household saving out of current income--would be favorable for fostering sustainable economic growth and better balance between spending and production here in the United States. The effects on economic activity of a deceleration in consumption spending are likely to be offset to some extent by a pickup in demand from other sectors. In addition to the boost to construction spending from rebuilding efforts, the growth of business capital spending more broadly should strengthen. Increases in business investment moderated substantially during the late spring and early summer after exceptionally sharp gains late last year. Some of the slowing may have reflected the normal unevenness of spending. But uncertainties about final demands from domestic households and from foreign export customers as the dollar strengthened and foreign growth lagged earlier this year also may have weighed on firms' capital spending plans. Moreover, there may have been some spillover from the inventory adjustment in manufacturing. Looking ahead, some of the restraining influences on investment spending appear likely to wane. Production and the demand for capital likely will strengthen with the turn in inventory investment; several foreign economies, such as Japan, seem to be experiencing more robust demand; and any tendency toward more-settled conditions in energy markets would help to alleviate uncertainty about both foreign and domestic demand. Taking account both of the hurricane-related disruptions and subsequent boost to activity from rebuilding, and of the underlying fundamentals affecting aggregate demand, the economy would still seem poised to expand more quickly than the rate of growth of its sustainable potential unless monetary policy accommodation is removed further. However, a measured firming of policy should forestall added cost and price pressures and keep inflation contained. True, the increase in business costs that has resulted from the rise in the prices of petroleum products and natural gas is likely to feed through to some extent into measures of core inflation for a time. But the effect of energy prices on core inflation has been much attenuated over the past two decades as the energy intensity of production has declined, increases in petroleum prices have generally been quickly reversed, and inflation expectations have become better anchored. This time around, however, it seems likely that only a small portion of the run-up of oil prices over the past year will be reversed, at least judging from the path of futures prices. In that environment, keeping inflation expectations anchored will be especially important for preventing the recent increases in energy prices from getting built into future inflation. So far, market-based measures of required inflation compensation beyond the next few years have changed little on balance since late August. Respondents in surveys of households appear to have become a bit more concerned, though households have likely been influenced more than financial market participants by what they are seeing at the gasoline pump each day. The consumer price index (CPI) data released Friday provided some evidence that the very substantial increases in the prices of many petroleum-based products have not found their way into core consumer prices--at least not yet. And at 2 percent, the twelve-month change in core CPI in September not only remained fairly low, but also was the same as it was a year ago. No one price measure is ever a sufficient indicator of overall inflation developments, and the case for concentrating on core inflation is not as strong when energy prices are not expected to reverse. But core inflation measures still likely reflect underlying demand-supply balances better than do total inflation measures and are therefore better gauges for judging future inflation developments. As I noted earlier, the range of possible outcomes around these central tendencies seems wider now than it has for some time--or at least there is a little more weight on lower-probability outcomes. And I see several sources of uncertainty in addition to those associated with the intensity of the hurricane disruptions and the timing and extent of rebuilding. One source of uncertainty involves the reactions of households and businesses to higher prices of petroleum products and natural gas. By their nature, such price increases point to downside risks to demand and output--especially when they are associated with supply disruptions--and upside risks to inflation. Although households seem to have cut back spending moderately in response to increases in energy prices this year, surveys suggest that they are now feeling the pinch of higher energy prices. Prices of gasoline should continue to retrace their post-Katrina upsurge, but natural gas prices are likely to remain high for some time, and consumers could cut spending by more than is currently anticipated over coming months, which could then feed back on business capital spending. At the same time, however, persistently high energy prices also raise the possibility that inflation expectations could ratchet higher, even if core inflation remains fairly low in the short run. If expectations did become less well anchored, core inflation could subsequently rise and the higher level could persist. Another source of uncertainty is the housing market. It is possible that the rapid increases in house prices could simply be a reflection of fundamental forces such as an increase in land use restrictions and other legal restraints on building, innovations in mortgage finance, changes in tax laws and low interest rates. But it could also be the case that much of the very rapid increase in prices very recently has been based on the expectation that the pace of past increases will extend into the future. Or perhaps the increases also have been fueled by eased lending standards that could well be tightened in response to slower price appreciation. If expectations have been realistic and lending practices only marginally important, a slowdown in house-price appreciation could be gradual and the consequences for consumption growth could be modest; indeed, as signs of a slowdown are still quite tentative, continued strength in house prices are an upside risk to any easing of demand going forward. But if disappointed expectations or considerably tighter credit foster more severe or more abrupt price adjustments in enough local housing markets, psychology could amplify the effects of diminished wealth to restrain consumer spending. Economists, including those at central banks, simply are not very good at understanding, much less predicting, the dynamics of asset price adjustments; and I would guess that our ignorance is especially profound when those dynamics may be in the process of shifting. A third area of uncertainty concerns the broader macroeconomic risks to the inflation outlook. One risk is a possible substantial tilt up in the growth of compensation per hour as workers try to offset some of hit to their real incomes from higher energy prices at a time of relatively full resource utilization. A second risk is a possible slowing in underlying productivity growth from the substantial gains of the past decade toward the more subdued pace of the preceding quarter century. If both possibilities were to be realized over the next year, unit labor costs could surge, putting severe upward pressure on prices. Profit margins are elevated and competitive pressures could force firms to absorb a good portion of those cost increases. But they would not do so willingly or completely. To the extent that firms were able to exercise pricing power and maintain margins, rising costs would feed through to greater inflation. This is not, however, what I expect to happen. As I noted already, productivity has been well maintained and despite mixed signals, the growth of labor compensation does not appear to be accelerating noticeably. But I will be paying close attention to developments in costs as well as in prices as I update my inflation forecasts in the future. In sum, I see risks on both sides of my expectations that the growth of economic activity will slow modestly on balance over the next year or so, leaving the economy producing at about its sustainable potential. But unless activity slows unexpectedly, and after the rise in retail energy prices, the risks may be skewed a little toward the upside on inflation. Because the economy is producing at a reasonably high level and activity is most likely on a solid upward track, my focus at this time is naturally on keeping inflation contained. Our economy works best when households and businesses do not need to take account of persistent increases or decreases in the general price level in making their decisions about spending and production. Low inflation also makes policymaking easier because a high degree of confidence by households and firms that inflation will remain low gives the Federal Reserve added latitude to move aggressively against any economic weakness that may develop. And a lesson of the 1980s is that it is costly to wring inflation out of the system once it becomes entrenched. I do not know what path of rates will, in fact, be required to accomplish our objectives. Obviously, we are considerably closer to where policy needs to be than we were sixteen months ago, but we are not yet at a point where we can stop and watch the economy evolve for a while. But you should appreciate that we did not enter into this episode of policy firming with a fixed notion of our ultimate destination. How far we go will depend on the evolution of economic activity and prices. In this regard, I think the policy tactics followed by the FOMC over recent years will be helpful. We have moved rates higher gradually and announced our intentions in a manner that underscores that these intentions depend on the economic outlook. The announcement should enable market participants to get a more accurate view of our intentions sooner and build them into financial market conditions, which then feed back on spending. This transparency, together with the gradual trajectory of policy actions, should help us to get a better and more timely fix on the effects of our actions than in the past. No doubt, the heightened level of uncertainty, along with the distortions to incoming data from hurricane effects, will complicate the conduct of policy. Although it will be more difficult, we still should be able to discern underlying developments in the important sectors I discussed--housing markets, consumer purchases, business investment, costs and prices. It is these readings and their implications for the future, together with developments in financial markets that could affect activity and inflation, that I will be looking at to judge what policy setting is likely to foster stable prices and sustained growth.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Receipt of the Truman Medal for Economic Policy Before the Truman Medal Award and Economics Conference, Kansas City, Missouri October 26, 2005 I am pleased to be here today and to have the honor of being the first recipient of the Truman Medal for Economic Policy. I want to thank the Truman Library Institute for sponsoring this award and supporting the Truman Library. The Truman Presidential Library performs an important public service by promoting scholarly work and presenting the life and times of President Truman, thereby providing us all with a better basis for addressing today's challenges. The Truman Administration marked a time of dramatic change as World War II ended and the architecture of the post-war era was put in place. In the words of Truman biographer David McCullough, that era was "the watershed time of the century and Truman stands forth now--especially now in the aftermath of the Cold War--as a figure of utmost importance." Within the realm of economic policy, part of Truman's importance derives from the fact that several key new governmental structures were established during his Administration. Among these were the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress (JEC). These organizations were established by the Employment Act of 1946, signed by President Truman on February 20. In my remarks today, I will discuss the origins of the Employment Act and the history of the CEA and will also reflect on my time at the Council. Two ingredients seem to have been essential precursors of the Employment Act. The first was a deep concern that the problem of peacetime unemployment had not been solved. Although employment roared back during the war, the memory of the Great Depression was quite fresh, and considerable uncertainty attended the economic outlook. Put simply, many feared that the economy would slip back into depression. The second element was the economic thinking of John Maynard Keynes. Keynes argued that the economy could get stuck at a point of inadequate aggregate demand and high unemployment and that deficit spending by the government could provide the stimulus needed to reach and sustain a better equilibrium. President Truman's memoirs make clear that both of these strands--the fear of depression and the view that the government has a role to play in economic stabilization--influenced his request to the Congress for full employment legislation in the fall of 1945. Of course, the legislative process is full of compromise and can lead to unexpected outcomes, and according to some observers, the creation of the CEA by the Employment Act was just such an event. According to Herb Stein's history of the CEA--he was chairman during the Nixon Administration--the CEA was an accident that did not need to have happened. Early drafts of the Employment Act enshrined very specific, and simple-minded, Keynesian policy prescriptions that worked backward from estimates of full employment to specific numerical targets for investment and fiscal policy. Not surprisingly, many in the Congress opposed such provisions. In the end, the numerical targets were struck from the act, and "full employment" became "maximum employment, production, and purchasing power." As Stein tells the story, the bill was seen as lacking in substance at this point. That gap was filled by creating new processes and institutions--hence, the CEA, the annual Economic Report of the President , and the JEC. This outcome was indeed fortuitous. The CEA consists of a chairman and two other members, all of whom are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In its early years during the Truman Administration, the CEA was not without controversy. The two best-known members of the first CEA--the Chairman, Edwin Nourse, and Leon Keyserling--clashed repeatedly about whether the agency should just provide private advice to the President or should be a public advocate for the Administration's economic program. More broadly, however, the Truman CEA marked a transition from a relatively ad hoc style of economic policy making to a more institutionalized and focused process. The groundwork was laid for an agency that would make lasting contributions to economic policy making. These contributions have taken several forms. Over the years, the CEA has provided objective and professional economic advice at the highest levels in the White House. Remarkably, this tiny agency has asserted its influence even while filling most of its positions with economists who were on temporary leave from other professional activities. A hallmark of the ethos of the CEA is the pride that its staff members take in providing objective analysis. That devotion first and foremost to objectivity has led to the interesting phenomenon that, while the overall economic views of Administrations have swung widely, the policy advice given by their successive CEAs has undergone far smaller swings. Even though the average tenure among members of the Council and staff economists is short--often just a year or two--there have been some sources of continuity. Perhaps the most remarkable element of continuity has been the service of Catherine Furlong, better known to her friends and colleagues as "Kitty." She recently retired after fifty-four years of service, with her tenure extending back to the earliest years of the agency during the Truman Administration. Among other important roles, Kitty was the fact-checker-in-chief at the CEA--an important position when the stock of the agency depends critically on its credibility. For Presidents on down, having your material fact-checked by Kitty meant that you were going to meet the gold standard of credibility. The type of continuity she provided is rare in the government and contributed to the CEA's success over the years. Among its contributions, the CEA serves as an in-house research organization that can assemble, analyze, and present information relevant to an economic decision. Many of the members and staff come from research backgrounds and are uniquely positioned to play this role in the Administration. Because the CEA has retained its small size over the years, it can be quick and nimble in ways that are difficult for some larger agencies. Moreover, because the CEA is viewed as a neutral agency without ties to any particular constituency, the CEA often has played an important role on interagency committees and working groups, ensuring that economic insights are heard at debates about key issues. Along those lines, perhaps the most important role of the CEA has been to scuttle many of the more adventuresome ideas that inevitably bubble up through the machinery of government. In every Administration, all sorts of ideas for changes in spending, tax, and regulatory policy are developed by one agency or another and then circulated within the Administration. A few of these ideas are genuinely good. However, many of them are ill-advised and not well thought through and fail miserably the test of benefits exceeding costs. Often, it falls to the CEA to point out the flaws and derail these ideas. This role of the CEA is wholly unheralded--after all, who hears about the idea that never came to fruition--but it serves as an important check in the policymaking process. As I mentioned, economic thinking at the CEA has been marked by important continuities. Nevertheless, the evolution of thinking at the CEA over the years has reflected the economic challenges of each era as well as continuing developments in economic research. The ideas of Keynesian stabilization that were an important motivation for the Employment Act reached their zenith during the Kennedy Administration. Since that time, the CEA has followed the economics profession away from a belief that fiscal policy can or should fine-tune the level of aggregate demand. During the 1960s and 1970s, the economy was confronted by rising inflation pressures, a series of energy shocks, and a slowdown in the underlying pace of productivity growth. At the same time, there was considerable ferment within the economics profession, as prevailing views of the inflation process and of the government's role in economic stabilization were challenged. Successive CEAs agonized over these issues and over whether to use the new ideas emerging from the academy and, if so, how. Since the 1980s, the CEA has focused increasingly on understanding the sources of economic growth and the supply side of the economy. The focus on international issues, too, has intensified as trade and international financial flows between the United States and other countries have grown. I should also note that, despite its overtly macroeconomic origins, the CEA has expanded successfully into the realm of microeconomics, particularly issues related to regulatory policy and market structure. Notwithstanding these changes in focus over time, there have been important intellectual continuities. In particular, a common theme throughout the CEA's history has been a belief in the importance of market forces, and this belief stands as an important legacy of the CEA. Of course, as chairman of the Council during President Ford's Administration, I was close to some of these debates and decisions. I was recruited to serve as chairman of the Council by President Nixon's economic team. As it turned out, I was before the Senate Banking Committee for confirmation the day that President Nixon resigned. President Ford quickly renominated me, and I began work at the CEA in September 1974. I was privileged to serve President Ford, and found him to be a very effective leader. Parenthetically, there are some interesting parallels between President Ford and President Truman. Both were serving as Vice President and became President rather unexpectedly; both men had had extensive legislative and budget experience in the Congress; and both men had belief systems anchored by strong core values. During my years at the CEA, the focus of the economic policy team underwent a number of twists and turns. In the fall of 1974, inflation was the critical issue. Some months later, it became apparent that a recession was under way, and attention turned toward policies for recovery. Subsequently, the focus on inflation returned. It was a challenging time, and we did not solve all the problems that we confronted. Nevertheless, I found my time there quite rewarding and benefited greatly from my work with the other members and with the very highly skilled staff. I could recount much about the work of the CEA at that time, but I will only highlight three themes that recurred during my tenure. First, economic modeling is as much art as science. Economic policy makers face enormous uncertainty. Economic models provide a set of useful tools to frame future outcomes; but as we were reminded repeatedly during our efforts to forecast the economy in 1974 and 1975, models can go off track in myriad ways. Objective and thorough analysis, as is the norm at the CEA, is the most effective counterweight to this challenge. Second, high-quality and timely data are crucial inputs to the process of making economic policy. Because we had access to high-frequency data, we were able to see that the sharp further downturn in the economy in early 1975 reflected largely an inventory correction and that final demand was holding up. That insight provided support for the view that, so long as final demand was sustained, recovery was imminent. As it turned out, that was the right call. Finally, as hard as this can be to achieve, economic policy should take the long view. Although pressures to use the government's tools of economic management to achieve one or another short-term aim are always present, the tools of government are, in fact, most appropriately used to create an environment in which private economic activity can flourish over the longer run. As I indicated, the focus of the CEA has changed over the years as the economic challenges facing the nation have changed. Through all this history, the CEA has, in most cases, provided the President with the best economic advice available at the time and has, crucially, been a consistent advocate for the importance of market forces. Whether or not all of those involved in passing the Employment Act and creating the CEA realized it at the time, they created an enduring agency that has played a significant role in economic policy making. President Truman apparently had an inkling. He noted in his memoirs: Occasionally, as we pore through the pages of history, we are struck by the fact that some incident, little noted at the time, profoundly affects the whole subsequent course of events. I venture the prediction that history, someday, will so record the enactment of the Employment Act. I concur with President Truman's assessment. Indeed, based on a cost-benefit test, surely the CEA must be one of the most successful government agencies in history. Footnotes See David McCullough, Truman (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1992).

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Opening remarks At the dedication of the Houston Branch building of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Houston, Texas October 27, 2005 Mayor White, President Fisher, members of the Boards of Directors, officers, employees, and guests, thank you for inviting me. It is a pleasure to be in Houston this morning. As we all know, this region of the country has been through some traumatic times over the last several months and the challenges it faces are significant. Throughout this struggle, the quick action and generosity of your city, as well as the State of Texas, has been apparent to the rest of the country. Before I go on, I want to thank all of you who work at Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and, in particular, here in the Houston Branch. We in, what may seem like, distant Washington highly regard the work that goes on here. Your efforts contribute directly to the Fedâ€™s reputation as a credible, efficient central bank that can be depended upon, not just daily, but in times of crisis as well. When I think of all the great Texans I have known over the years, I inevitably recall the man you have chosen to honor with the naming of this building, my friend, confidant and golf partner, Edward W. Kelley, Jr. Iâ€™ve known Mike Kelley since my first day at the Federal Reserve Board in 1987. While Mike served on the Board, he was keenly interested in a wide range of issues that spanned the gamut of what the Federal Reserve does, but he also cared deeply about the people of the Federal Reserve System. The Board and its employees could always count on him to go beyond the call of duty and to lend a helping hand. And his perspective as a business executive was very valuable and clearly enriched our discussion on any number of topics. One of Mikeâ€™s most painstaking projects at the Board was preparing the System for Y2K. There was a strange and appreciated quietude early that New Yearâ€™s Day when the lights stayed on and the computers kept humming. The system worked. Moreover, following September 11, 2001, we found that the Y2K preparations and fixes had far-greater reach than we realized. In retrospect, they apparently also contributed directly to the success of the System in crisis mode following the attacks. Additionally, during his tenure at the Board, Mike was instrumental in increasing the efficiency of the Federal Reserve System. When he started at the Board, the Fedâ€™s twelve regional Banks, in many ways, operated as separate institutions, each offering the same services to the depository institutions within its District boundaries. Mike was the driving force behind the evolution that, now more than ever before, has the twelve regional Banks operating as a coordinated, seamless national system. But Mikeâ€™s contributions have not been confined to the Fed System; he has long been engaged with organizations important to him: the YMCA, the Better Business Bureau, the Harris County United Fund, and the Houston Symphony, to name only a few. For all of these reasons and more--I havenâ€™t even gotten into stories from the golf course--it is with great pleasure that I help you dedicate this building to a man I have long admired, Mike Kelley. I wish all of you the best with this new facility.
