Chairman Ben S. Bernanke Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. Chairman Bernanke presented identical remarks before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives on July 18, 2012 Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shelby, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semiannualMonetary Policy Report to the Congress. I will begin with a discussion of current economic conditions and the outlook before turning to monetary policy. The Economic OutlookThe U.S. economy has continued to recover, but economic activity appears to have decelerated somewhat during the first half of this year. After rising at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent in the second half of 2011, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 2 percent pace in the first quarter of 2012, and available indicators point to a still-smaller gain in the second quarter. Conditions in the labor market improved during the latter part of 2011 and early this year, with the unemployment rate falling about a percentage point over that period. However, after running at nearly 200,000 per month during the fourth and first quarters, the average increase in payroll employment shrank to 75,000 per month during the second quarter. Issues related to seasonal adjustment and the unusually warm weather this past winter can account for a part, but only a part, of this loss of momentum in job creation. At the same time, the jobless rate has recently leveled out at just over 8 percent. Household spending has continued to advance, but recent data indicate a somewhat slower rate of growth in the second quarter. Although declines in energy prices are now providing some support to consumers' purchasing power, households remain concerned about their employment and income prospects and their overall level of confidence remains relatively low. We have seen modest signs of improvement in housing. In part because of historically low mortgage rates, both new and existing home sales have been gradually trending upward since last summer, and some measures of house prices have turned up in recent months. Construction has increased, especially in the multifamily sector. Still, a number of factors continue to impede progress in the housing market. On the demand side, many would-be buyers are deterred by worries about their own finances or about the economy more generally. Other prospective homebuyers cannot obtain mortgages due to tight lending standards, impaired creditworthiness, or because their current mortgages are underwaterââthat is, they owe more than their homes are worth. On the supply side, the large number of vacant homes, boosted by the ongoing inflow of foreclosed properties, continues to divert demand from new construction. After posting strong gains over the second half of 2011 and into the first quarter of 2012, manufacturing production has slowed in recent months. Similarly, the rise in real business spending on equipment and software appears to have decelerated from the double-digit pace seen over the second half of 2011 to a more moderate rate of growth over the first part of this year. Forward-looking indicators of investment demand--such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans--suggest further weakness ahead. In part, slowing growth in production and capital investment appears to reflect economic stresses in Europe, which, together with some cooling in the economies of other trading partners, is restraining the demand for U.S. exports. At the time of the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), my colleagues and I projected that, under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy, economic growth will likely continue at a moderate pace over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually. Specifically, our projections for growth in real GDP prepared for the meeting had a central tendency of 1.9 to 2.4 percent for this year and 2.2 to 2.8 percent for 2013.1These forecasts are lower than those we made in January, reflecting the generally disappointing tone of the recent incoming data.2In addition, financial strains associated with the crisis in Europe have increased since earlier in the year, which--as I already noted--are weighing on both global and domestic economic activity. The recovery in the United States continues to be held back by a number of other headwinds, including still-tight borrowing conditions for some businesses and households, and--as I will discuss in more detail shortly--the restraining effects of fiscal policy and fiscal uncertainty. Moreover, although the housing market has shown improvement, the contribution of this sector to the recovery is less than has been typical of previous recoveries. These headwinds should fade over time, allowing the economy to grow somewhat more rapidly and the unemployment rate to decline toward a more normal level. However, given that growth is projected to be not much above the rate needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force, the reduction in the unemployment rate seems likely to be frustratingly slow. Indeed, the central tendency of participants' forecasts now has the unemployment rate at 7 percent or higher at the end of 2014. The Committee made comparatively small changes in June to its projections for inflation. Over the first three months of 2012, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose about 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate, boosted by a large increase in retail energy prices that in turn reflected the higher cost of crude oil. However, the sharp drop in crude oil prices in the past few months has brought inflation down. In all, the PCE price index rose at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent over the first five months of this year, compared with a 2-1/2 percent rise over 2011 as a whole. The central tendency of the Committee's projections is that inflation will be 1.2 to 1.7 percent this year, and at or below the 2 percent level that the Committee judges to be consistent with its statutory mandate in 2013 and 2014. Risks to the OutlookParticipants at the June FOMC meeting indicated that they see a higher degree of uncertainty about their forecasts than normal and that the risks to economic growth have increased. I would like to highlight two main sources of risk: The first is the euro-area fiscal and banking crisis; the second is the U.S. fiscal situation. Earlier this year, financial strains in the euro area moderated in response to a number of constructive steps by the European authorities, including the provision of three-year bank financing by the European Central Bank. However, tensions in euro-area financial markets intensified again more recently, reflecting political uncertainties in Greece and news of losses at Spanish banks, which in turn raised questions about Spain's fiscal position and the resilience of the euro-area banking system more broadly. Euro-area authorities have responded by announcing a number of measures, including funding for the recapitalization of Spain's troubled banks, greater flexibility in the use of the European financial backstops (including, potentially, the flexibility to recapitalize banks directly rather than through loans to sovereigns), and movement toward unified supervision of euro-area banks. Even with these announcements, however, Europe's financial markets and economy remain under significant stress, with spillover effects on financial and economic conditions in the rest of the world, including the United States. Moreover, the possibility that the situation in Europe will worsen further remains a significant risk to the outlook. The Federal Reserve remains in close communication with our European counterparts. Although the politics are complex, we believe that the European authorities have both strong incentives and sufficient resources to resolve the crisis. At the same time, we have been focusing on improving the resilience of our financial system to severe shocks, including those that might emanate from Europe. The capital and liquidity positions of U.S. banking institutions have improved substantially in recent years, and we have been working with U.S. financial firms to ensure they are taking steps to manage the risks associated with their exposures to Europe. That said, European developments that resulted in a significant disruption in global financial markets would inevitably pose significant challenges for our financial system and our economy. The second important risk to our recovery, as I mentioned, is the domestic fiscal situation. As is well known, U.S. fiscal policies are on an unsustainable path, and the development of a credible medium-term plan for controlling deficits should be a high priority. At the same time, fiscal decisions should take into account the fragility of the recovery. That recovery could be endangered by the confluence of tax increases and spending reductions that will take effect early next year if no legislative action is taken. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, if the full range of tax increases and spending cuts were allowed to take effect--a scenario widely referred to as the fiscal cliff--a shallow recession would occur early next year and about 1-1/4 million fewer jobs would be created in 2013.3These estimates do not incorporate the additional negative effects likely to result from public uncertainty about how these matters will be resolved. As you recall, market volatility spiked and confidence fell last summer, in part as a result of the protracted debate about the necessary increase in the debt ceiling. Similar effects could ensue as the debt ceiling and other difficult fiscal issues come into clearer view toward the end of this year. The most effective way that the Congress could help to support the economy right now would be to work to address the nation's fiscal challenges in a way that takes into account both the need for long-run sustainability and the fragility of the recovery. Doing so earlier rather than later would help reduce uncertainty and boost household and business confidence. Monetary PolicyIn view of the weaker economic outlook, subdued projected path for inflation, and significant downside risks to economic growth, the FOMC decided to ease monetary policy at its June meeting by continuing its maturity extension program (or MEP) through the end of this year. The MEP combines sales of short-term Treasury securities with an equivalent amount of purchases of longer-term Treasury securities. As a result, it decreases the supply of longer-term Treasury securities available to the public, putting upward pressure on the prices of those securities and downward pressure on their yields, without affecting the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. By removing additional longer-term Treasury securities from the market, the Fed's asset purchases also induce private investors to acquire other longer-term assets, such as corporate bonds and mortgage backed-securities, helping to raise their prices and lower their yields and thereby making broader financial conditions more accommodative. Economic growth is also being supported by the exceptionally low level of the target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent and the Committee's forward guidance regarding the anticipated path of the funds rate. As I reported in my February testimony, the FOMC extended its forward guidance at its January meeting, noting that it expects that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee has maintained this conditional forward guidance at its subsequent meetings. Reflecting its concerns about the slow pace of progress in reducing unemployment and the downside risks to the economic outlook, the Committee made clear at its June meeting that it is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability. Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions. 1.See table 1, "Economic Projections of Federal Reserve Board Members and Federal Reserve Bank Presidents, June 2012," of the Summary of Economic Projections, available at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), "Federal Reserve Board and Federal Open Market Committee Release Economic Projections from the June 19-20 FOMC Meeting," press release, June 20; table 1 is also available in Part 4 of the JulyMonetary Policy Report to the Congress.Return to text 2.Ben S.

Governor Elizabeth A. Duke At the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies 60th Anniversary Conference, Mexico City, Mexico It is a pleasure to participate in this commemorative conference on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA). Since its establishment in 1952, CEMLA has achieved a great deal on both the policy and research fronts to promote our understanding of monetary and banking issues in Latin America and the Caribbean. The topic I have been asked to speak about today, "Central Bank Cooperation in Times of Crisis," is very important. As we know, central banks typically work individually to achieve objectives for their domestic economies. In the case of the Federal Reserve, monetary policy is conducted to achieve our statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. And, of course, fostering a stable financial system is key to attaining these goals. But the experience of the past few years has illustrated--first with the global financial crisis and more recently with the strains in Europe--that cooperation and coordination among central banks around the world may be necessary at critical junctures to achieve these domestic objectives. In my remarks today, I will describe the evolution of the Federal Reserve's policies during and after the global recession and show how many of those policies were undertaken in coordination with, or in parallel to, similar actions by other central banks. I will start with the monetary policy responses of the Federal Reserve and other central banks during the financial crisis. I will then discuss the efforts that the Federal Reserve has made, often in cooperation with other central banks and international partners, to help enhance financial stability. Finally, I will focus on the challenges facing Latin American central banks, whose economies and financial systems were affected by the crisis itself, and by the responses of other central banks to the crisis.1 Federal Reserve Policies and Coordination with Other Central BanksAlthough the financial crisis that emerged in the summer of 2007 initially manifested itself as a sharp deterioration in U.S. mortgage markets, the roots of the problem ran deeper. Indeed, the consequences of a credit boom combined with excessive leverage, mispricing of risk, and deficiencies in risk management became increasingly apparent. And given the international extent of these vulnerabilities and interconnections, the crisis quickly became global. Central banks around the world responded forcefully. From the outset, the Federal Reserve vigorously used its traditional toolkit for managing short-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate from 5-1/4 percent in August 2007 to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent by the end of 2008. International coordination on policy rate decisions is rare, but in October 2008, the Federal Reserve announced a reduction in its policy rate jointly with five other major central banks: the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Swedish Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank. With clear signs of simultaneous economic slowing in many countries, this coordinated action sent a strong positive signal to financial markets about policymakers' collective intent to mitigate the effects of the crisis on their economies. Although not through directly coordinated actions, other central banks, including those in Latin America, were also reducing policy rates. The stresses in financial markets and liquidity shortages were severe. So, in addition to cutting policy rates, the Federal Reserve took measures designed to provide liquidity first to banks and later to other financial institutions. A third set of measures involved the provision of liquidity to address pressures in commercial paper markets and at money market funds. These liquidity programs were largely unwound when financial markets improved. As the Federal Reserve and other central banks worked to address liquidity shortages in their own markets, it became clear that, as a result of globalization, firms were experiencing funding shortages not only in domestic currencies, but in foreign currencies as well. In particular, dollar funding shortages appeared not just in the United States but in countries around the world, which, in turn, exacerbated pressures in U.S. funding markets. The Federal Reserve already was providing liquidity to foreign financial firms operating in the United States through its discount window and other facilities. To further address pressures in dollar funding markets and support the flow of credit to U.S. families and businesses, the Federal Reserve ultimately approved bilateral currency swap arrangements with 14 foreign central banks, including two Latin American central banks.2Under these swap arrangements, in exchange for their own currencies, foreign central banks obtained dollars from the Federal Reserve to lend to financial institutions in their jurisdictions. These swap arrangements pose essentially no risk to the Federal Reserve: They are unwound (with a fee paid by the central bank drawing on the swap arrangement to the Federal Reserve) at the exact same exchange rate that applied to the original transaction, they are conducted with major central banks with track records of prudent decisionmaking, and they are secured by the foreign currency provided by those central banks. The success of these swap lines in alleviating funding pressures and reducing interbank borrowing rates is a testament to the benefits of central bank cooperation. Moreover, in addition to easing funding shortages, these swaps also helped to allay market fears--they had a preventive as well as a curative role. For example, four of the central banks that participated in these arrangements--Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, and Singapore--did not end up drawing on the facilities, but it is generally believed that the existence of the lines helped prevent stresses that could have otherwise developed. As the financial crisis receded, the swap lines were closed in February 2010. However, swap lines with several foreign central banks were reopened in response to financial strains that developed in Europe.3 In many countries, policy rates fell to nearly zero. With substantial economic slack remaining, these central banks faced the challenge of finding ways to further ease monetary policy. The Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet through the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities. The idea was to put downward pressure on longer-term yields to spur demand and also to encourage some portfolio rebalancing toward riskier assets and loans to the private sector. More recently, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities by selling shorter-maturity Treasury securities and buying longer-maturity Treasury securities. This maturity extension program created additional downward pressure on long-term rates without expanding the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. In addition to using conventional monetary policy and balance sheet tools to provide monetary accommodation, communication is an important tool used by central banks to enhance the effectiveness of policy. At the conclusion of each meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee issues a statement of policy actions taken and the rationale for those actions. Detailed minutes are published three weeks later, and lightly edited transcripts are made public with a five-year lag. In 2011, the Chairman began holding press conferences on a roughly quarterly basis to discuss economic projections submitted by participants and actions taken at the meeting. In August 2011, the Committee statement included forward guidance that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013--a date that was later extended to late 2014--which put further downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. In January 2012, the Committee released a statement of its longer-run goals and policy strategy. At that same meeting, the Committee also began including participant projections of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in the Summary of Economic Projections. The Committee continues to discuss ways in which communication can be used to enhance policy. While these policy moves of the Federal Reserve were not coordinated with other central banks, other central banks shared these challenges and responded in broadly similar ways to expand their balance sheets. For example, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan also used large-scale purchases of medium- and long-term government securities to provide stimulus. In addition, several other foreign central banks, including the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan, also more actively used forward guidance about the path of policy rates. Finally, the common challenges and problems of the past few years reinforced the importance of open discussion among the world's central banks. Central bank leaders draw on collective experience through discussion in such diverse international forums as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Group of Twenty (G-20), and CEMLA. CEMLA is an excellent example of what can be achieved by central bank cooperation through such means as courses and seminars, international meetings, technical assistance, publication of research studies, and exchange programs. Cooperation in Areas of Supervision and RegulationCentral banks around the globe have focused not just on responding to the crisis, but also on working to minimize the risk of future crises by improving the soundness and stability of the financial sector. Indeed, the global financial crisis has underscored the importance of the financial stability objective of central banks. Given the global nature of financial markets and large financial institutions, coordination and cooperation among central banks and bank supervisors and regulators more generally is crucial in achieving this goal. Let me provide a few examples of such efforts. First, the crisis highlighted shortcomings in capital and liquidity requirements. Central banks with bank supervisory responsibilities have been heavily involved in designing and promoting international frameworks to address these shortcomings. The Federal Reserve has supported the Basel Committee's adoption of improved capital requirements that include raising risk-weightings for traded assets, improving the quality of loss-absorbing capital through a new minimum common equity ratio standard, creating a capital conservation buffer, and introducing an international leverage ratio requirement. The Federal Reserve has also supported the Basel Committee's work on quantitative liquidity requirements and its work on capital surcharges for banks of global systemic importance. Another example of international cooperation on the regulatory front is the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which consists of key financial regulators around the world, including the Federal Reserve. The FSB has identified a number of challenges that international cooperation among central banks and financial regulators are helping to address. One such challenge regards over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. To reduce the systemic risk of OTC derivatives, the G-20 leaders have agreed to require that standardized OTC derivatives be cleared through a central counterparty. Another challenge is that of cross-border resolutions, and the FSB has undertaken analytic work on how to improve the resolvability of financial firms that have a substantial international presence. The FSB has also identified and spurred cooperative work on gaps in financial data and on the so-called shadow banking system. As a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve has cooperated with foreign bank supervisors (including other central banks) through participation in supervisory colleges, which are multilateral standing working groups of supervisors formed for the purpose of enhancing effective consolidated supervision of an international banking organization. Supervisory colleges enhance the information exchange and cooperation of home and host supervisors to help them develop a better understanding of the risk profile of a banking organization. Lastly, at the Federal Reserve we have also been working closely with other U.S. agencies in the recently established Financial Stability Oversight Council on the implementation of the financial stability reforms laid out in the Dodd-Frank Act. One key aspect of this act is the focus on a "macroprudential approach" that pays attention to the financial system as a whole, in addition to individual financial institutions and markets. The greater emphasis on macroprudential tools has been widespread. Indeed, the Federal Reserve has participated in analyses of macroprudential tools and policies undertaken with other G-20 central banks at the BIS and with bank supervisors on the Basel Committee. One of the reasons that coordination is required for supervision and regulation is the substantial cross-border operations of many financial firms. The deleveraging of some global financial institutions with a significant presence in Latin America and the potential effect on economic performance serves as a stark reminder of the interlinkages of financial institutions and economies. The deleveraging of these institutions also highlights the need to coordinate across regulators and acts as a catalyst to spur greater action and information sharing. Latin American Central Banks: Crisis Response and ChallengesEarlier I mentioned how central banks around the world, including those in Latin America, lowered policy rates in response to the global financial crisis. Although the crisis developed in advanced economies, Latin American central banks, such as those in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, cut policy rates in 2009 as their economies were being hit hard through trade and financial linkages with advanced economies as well as through commodity price channels. Their capacity to follow countercyclical policies was in striking contrast to many previous times of stress, when policy rates could not be lowered for fear of frightening off international investors. The fact that these Latin American economies were able to respond by lowering policy rates and also by boosting fiscal support is a testament to the decisive steps taken to strengthen macroeconomic policies and financial systems, including improvements in the monetary frameworks under which their central banks operate. Many Latin American economies staged quick and strong recoveries from the global recession and subsequently started to raise policy rates to try to ward off overheating pressures. Conversely, many advanced economies, with their prolonged soft recoveries, needed to continue to follow expansionary monetary policies. Accordingly, as was also the case in emerging Asia, the monetary policy stance of several central banks in Latin America, such as Brazil and Chile, diverged from those of advanced economies. The resulting rise in interest rate differentials, on top of the generally stronger growth in Latin America, helped to fuel capital inflows, which, at times, have proved challenging for the policymakers of these economies to manage. Of course, more recently, with intensification of the crisis in Europe, some Latin American countries, most notably Brazil, have again lowered their policy rates in response to concerns about slowing growth. Even within Latin America, however, the experience of economies has not been uniform. In particular, Mexico, with its stronger ties to the United States, was hit earlier and harder than many other economies in the region. Even though Mexico's recovery in the second half of 2009 was strong, it had less momentum and considerable economic slack remained in the country. As such, the Bank of Mexico did not consider it necessary to raise policy rates during its recovery period, unlike many other Latin American central banks. These developments underscore an important point--that while central banks may benefit from coordination and cooperation, taking the same policy stance at the same time typically will not be the best choice for all central banks. Accordingly, it is imperative for each central bank to have monetary policy tools to appropriately address domestic objectives independent of the actions of other central banks. ConclusionIn this age of global financial integration, the Federal Reserve and other central banks often must cooperate to achieve their individual mandates. This need for coordination has been especially true during the recent crisis, when the actions of central banks working together proved very helpful in easing financial strains and boosting confidence. Indeed, closer ties and more-open lines of communication across central banks are some positive outcomes of these difficult times. This spirit of cooperation should continue as our respective central banks work to pursue monetary policies appropriate for our own economies while supporting stable financial systems around the world. 1.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to address you today. I'm especially pleased as an economist and policymaker to discuss the importance of education to the success of our economy. At the Federal Reserve we spend a lot of time looking at economic data, such as production and employment. In doing so, we try never to forget that these seemingly sterile numbers are, in fact, reflections of the economic aspirations, opportunities, and well-being of millions of Americans. When individuals are denied opportunities to reach their maximum potential, it harms not only those individuals, of course, but also the larger economy, which depends vitally on having a skilled, productive workforce. As a result, we all have a stake in the essential work that you are doing for our children. So how can we improve the opportunities for all children and give them a chance to succeed in our ever-changing, globalized economy? As the husband of a teacher and an educator myself, as well as a parent and former school board member, I know from personal experience that, for creating opportunity and changing lives, there is no substitute for a quality education. The research shows that effective educations lead to lower rates of poverty, higher lifetime earnings, and greater satisfaction on the job and at home. And specialists in economic development have identified educational attainment as a key source of economic growth and rising incomes in many countries around the world. Although education and the acquisition of skills is a lifelong process, starting early in life is crucial. Neuroscientists observe that if the first few years of a child's life include support for healthy development in families and communities, the child is more likely to succeed in school and to contribute to society as an adult. Conversely, without support during these early years, a child is ultimately more likely to drop out of school, earn lower wages, depend on government programs, or be incarcerated.1 Consistent with this research, early childhood education programs aim to nurture healthy development from the earliest years. Programs that provide enriched experiences for children and that also involve parents have shown to benefit children from all backgrounds, but they have the strongest influence on children from disadvantaged environments.2Importantly, state preschool assessments have shown that early childhood education programs make children better prepared for school, a precursor of future success.3 The benefits of early childhood programs are not just short-term in nature. Careful studies demonstrate that early interventions can have a positive effect on young children from low-income families that lasts well into adulthood. For example, analysis of one program showed that children who attended a high-quality half-day preschool program at ages 3 and 4 were, at age 40, more economically successful--for example, more likely to own their own homes--than nonparticipants in a control group.4In other evaluations, long-term benefits were demonstrated for a full-day early childhood education program starting before age 1 and for a nurse-based home visiting program.5 Economically speaking, early childhood programs are a good investment, with inflation-adjusted annual rates of return on the funds dedicated to these programs estimated to reach 10 percent or higher.6Very few alternative investments can promise that kind of return. Notably, a portion of these economic returns accrues to the children themselves and their families, but studies show that the rest of society enjoys the majority of the benefits, reflecting the many contributions that skilled and productive workers make to the economy.7 The Federal Reserve has long supported increasing educational opportunity for children, including the youngest. Federal Reserve Banks have published articles and convened community forums on early childhood issues. For school-age children, we sponsor financial literacy and economic education programs. For these programs, we make a special effort to reach schools with high proportions of minorities and lower-income children. Many of you in the audience today are still in school or have recently graduated. Your hard work demonstrates that you understand the value of a good education for yourself. With your efforts and the efforts of others, I hope we will one day achieve the Children's Defense Fund's goal of a level educational playing field for all children. I wish you all the best in your conference and in your work. Thank you. 1.See National Scientific Council on the Developing Child (2005), "Excessive Stress Disrupts the Architecture of the Developing Brain," Working Paper No. 3 (Cambridge, Mass.: Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, Summer).Return to text 2.See Arthur Rolnick and Rob Grunewald (2011), "The Economic Case for Targeted Preschool Programs," in Edward Zigler, Walter S.

The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced the approval of a final rule establishing risk-management standards for certain financial market utilities (FMUs) designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The final rule also establishes requirements for advance notice of proposed material changes to the rules, procedures, or operations of certain designated FMUs. FMUs, such as payment systems, central securities depositories, and central counterparties, provide the infrastructure to clear and settle payments and other financial transactions. The final rule (Regulation HH) implements two provisions of Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). It establishes risk-management standards governing the operations related to the payment, clearing, and settlement activities of designated FMUs, except those registered as clearing agencies with the Securities and Exchange Commission or as derivatives clearing organizations with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The risk-management standards are based on the recognized international standards developed by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) that were in existence at the time of the proposed rulemaking, which were incorporated previously into the Board's Policy on Payment System Risk.1 The final rule also establishes requirements for advance notice of proposed material changes to the rules, procedures, or operations of a designated FMU for which the Board is the supervisory agency under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act. The advance notice requirements set the threshold above which a proposed change would be considered material and thus require an advance notice to the Board, and also include provisions on the length of the review period. The final rule is substantively similar to the proposed rulemaking, with two exceptions. The final rule includes a new provision that would allow the Board to waive the application of certain Regulation HH standards to a particular type of designated FMU, where the risks presented by or the design of that designated FMU would make application of certain standards inappropriate. In addition, the Board has revised the illustrative list of changes that do not require an advance notice, in part to include changes to a designated FMU's fees, prices, or other charges. The final rule will be effective on September 14, 2012.Board VotesFederal Registernotice:HTML|PDF Comment:View For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955 1. In April 2012, CPSS and IOSCO completed an extensive review of those standards and issued the final report on the "Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures" (PFMI), which includes an updated, harmonized, and strengthened set of international risk-management standards applicable to FMUs. (SeeBoard press release on the PFMI.) The Board expects to review the PFMI, consult with other appropriate agencies and the Council, and seek public comment on the adoption of revised Regulation HH standards based on the PFMI.Return to text

The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced the approval of a final rule that amends the provisions in Regulation II (Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing) that permit a debit card issuer subject to the interchange fee standards to receive a fraud-prevention adjustment. The final rule revises provisions that are currently in effect as an interim final rule. Under the final rule, an issuer will be eligible for an adjustment of no more than 1 cent per transaction--the same amount as in the interim final rule--if it develops and implements policies and procedures that are designed to reduce the occurrence and costs of fraudulent debit card transactions. The final rule makes changes simplifying the elements required to be included in an issuer's fraud-prevention policies and procedures. To receive an adjustment, an issuer will be required to review its fraud-prevention policies and procedures, and their implementation, at least annually. An issuer also will be required to update its policies and procedures as necessary in light of their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness and, as currently required, in light of changes in the types of fraud and available methods of fraud-prevention. The final rule retains and clarifies the requirement that an issuer that meets these standards and wishes to receive the adjustment must annually notify the payment card networks in which it participates of its eligibility to receive the adjustment. In addition, the final rule explicitly prohibits an issuer from receiving or charging a fraud-prevention adjustment if the issuer is substantially noncompliant with the Board's fraud-prevention standards and describes steps an issuer must take once it becomes substantially noncompliant to become eligible to receive the fraud-prevention adjustment in the future. The amendments are effective on October 1, 2012.Federal Registernotice:HTML|PDF For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955

The Federal Reserve on Thursday issued supervisory guidance describing a new optional process for an applicant to request a response on a potential bank acquisition or other proposal before the submission of a formal application or notice. Federal Reserve System staff will review submitted questions about potential filings, otherwise known as pre-filings, before the submission of formal filings. Pre-filings may include a variety of information such as business plans, presentations outlining potential proposals, or other items about which potential applicants may have questions. This process is expected to benefit community banking organizations that do not file applications frequently and also pre-filers with novel proposals. Pre-filings should be submitted to the appropriate Reserve Bank or through the System's Electronic Applications System,E-Apps. The Federal Reserve anticipates that the review of pre-filings will take no more than 60 days. While most types of pre-filings should take considerably less than 60 days to review, the evaluation of complex or novel proposals may require the full 60 days or longer.

The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday reaffirmed its long-standing policy of applying relevant international risk-management standards to the Federal Reserve Banks' Fedwire funds and Fedwire securities services. These services play a critical role in the financial system and in facilitating the safe and efficient settlement of private-sector financial market utilities. The Board's announcement follows the Financial Stability Oversight Council's (FSOC) final designation of eight financial market utilities as systemically important for purposes of implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Under the Federal Reserve Act, the Board has supervisory authority over the Reserve Banks, including the Reserve Banks' provision of payment and settlement services. The Board is committed to the strong and effective supervision of the Reserve Banks and recognizes that critical Reserve Bank payment and settlement services should be subject to rigorous and comprehensive supervision that is comparable to or exceeds the supervision of similar private-sector payment and settlement arrangements. The Board's examination framework for Fedwire is consistent with the framework that will be used by the Federal Reserve for financial market utilities designated as systemically important by the FSOC and supervised by the Board. In addition, the Board is ensuring that the Reserve Banks are held to procedural requirements with respect to Board review of proposed material changes to Fedwire rules, procedures, and operations that are the same as, or higher than, the requirements for designated financial market utilities. In the coming months, the Board will be seeking comment on revisions to itsPayments System Risk (PSR) policyto take into account the new Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures that were issued in April by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions. The PSR policy, among other things, sets forth the Board's views and risk-management expectations for various payment and settlement systems, including those operated by the Reserve Banks.

Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin At the Graduate School of Banking at Colorado, Boulder, Colorado Thank you for inviting me to the Graduate School of Banking at Colorado to share some thoughts about your future and our common work. First, I want to offer my sincere condolences to the families and friends who lost loved ones in the terrible shooting in Aurora last week and wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured. This is a terrible tragedy and everyone across the country shares in the shock and sadness that the people of Colorado are experiencing. Turning now to the topic of my speech: We've all faced business decisions that offer the opportunity to choose between taking the high road and the low road. In the banking industry, the high road offers a way to do business and to succeed over the long term by building enduring relationships; structuring profitable, win-win arrangements; and treating customers and communities as meaningful stakeholders in the bank's work. But sometimes choosing this high road just doesn't seem to take us where we want to go fast enough. Suddenly, the low road can seem attractive and tantalizing, and it may offer short-term rewards that can be hard to resist. Taking the low road can be an exhilarating and profitable ride for a while, but it almost always leads to disaster and wreckage, and, when banks are the vehicle, taking the low road can cause significant economic and financial problems. As we've experienced over the last several years, when your car is wrecked, it's a long walk home. At the Federal Reserve, we are working with our fellow regulators to realign the restraints and incentives--the guard rails and HOV lanes, if you will--of the regulatory system to promote use of the high road and warn bankers off of the low roads where the rocks are falling, the curves are sharp, and many calamitous accidents happen. But this is not a task that the regulators can accomplish alone--any more than police officers can stop cell-phone use on the roads without the active participation of motorists, parents, telephone companies, the media, and so on. New laws and regulations may lay the groundwork for change, but necessary, sustainable results are realized only when the regulated--be they drivers or banks--get on board. If drivers are key players in ending texting-while-driving, then the banks themselves are essential actors in our economic comeback, and community banks play a central role. Community banks were not major culprits in the subprime mortgage crisis, but they definitely suffered from it and took some hard hits because of it. The best community banks exemplify the high-road virtues that we seek to revive as standard operating practices throughout the banking system generally. I am referring to close customer service, long-term vision and sustained relationships, investment that benefits both the bank and the community, commitment to sound underwriting, and consistently legal and ethical practices and transparent governance. Here at the graduate school, I imagine these high-road virtues to be one of the core values of the program, not peripheral after-thoughts to the course work that you are engaged in. This is good because, while I have been discussing the low road and the high road as though they are distinct and different physical destinations and directions, in fact it can often be difficult to tell the difference between the two. And just as a detailed map, GPS system, and sound experience and judgment can help a driver know which road to take, it can require deep study, careful analysis, and commitment to be prepared to see the positive and negative dynamics intrinsic to any situation and then to make the right choice. I believe your institutions have the capacity to do a lot of good, and that in fact your banks are doing good work every day. And that is why it is a privilege to be here to address you as future leaders of our country's community banks. The Role of BanksLarge-scale economic and financial events provide an opportunity to re-think basic assumptions--that is, once we get through the period of crisis management. But it takes a while to get there, and reactions to financial crises consist, first, of strategic containment, and then, of developing techniques of prevention. In terms of our recent financial crisis, the Federal Reserve attempted to provide the containment through the use of both traditional and innovative macroeconomic tools. Congress, in turn, attempted to supply the subsequent preventative tools. In that regard, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which embodied Congress' strategy for preventing another crisis, was passed in July 2010. But in addition to containment and prevention, there is a third component to a meaningful response that we ignore at the public's peril. And that is a significant probing of the more fundamental aspects of how well our financial system is serving us, and at what cost. In fact, I have spent a lot of time, post-crisis, thinking about the role that banks and other financial market entities play in the U.S. economy and in local communities, how well they play that role, and how much it costs us as a society to encourage or enforce that role through regulation. To date, much of the public discussion of the recent financial crisis has focused on the specific symptoms of this particular episode of financial malfunction. Most people are aware that the staggering loss of jobs, income, and wealth we experienced were associated with what went wrong in the financial sphere. But we cannot forget the need to relate these results to the role that banks and other financial market entities should play in the first place. We need to ask how well banks and financial market entities are performing that role and how to assess the public and private sector costs associated with assuring that they play this role. In many ways, the choice of which road to take is a function of the particular business model that the financial institution chooses for itself. As community bankers, you have embraced a business model for your banks that is based almost exclusively on pure financial intermediation between borrowers who want to engage in economically productive activities--many of which are for businesses and homeowners in your communities--and depositors who have funds to advance for such activities. This high-road business model means that your financial institutions easily understand the impact of your actions on local homeowners, businesses, and communities. As a state financial regulator, I saw the individual impact that financial institutions had on the local and overall economies of the state; at the Federal Reserve Board, I see the collective impact that these activities have on the economy as a whole. Your institutions factor those considerations into their business processes, practices, and decisions, which ultimately both create and reflect the culture at your banks. The high-road business model embodies a public and economic imperative that unifies and animates your banking cultures and decisions. Indeed, the high-road business model of a bank allows you to continually challenge the model with the question: Does this banking model interfere with a notion of public welfare and economic common good? Or advance it? But there are also flawed business models that create misaligned incentives that lead to what I believe are low-road outcomes. Such outcomes stem from a banking model that blithely ignores the core function of banks as financial intermediaries between those who have credit and those who need it. The low-road banking model leads to a series of business choices emanating from a business plan and culture focused largely on quick profits with little consideration of longer-term risks and costs, not only to individual firms, but also to the financial system more broadly. The model implies indifference to the consequences of poor risk management, executive compensation schemes that encourage unmitigated and unmonitored risk-taking, and reliance on public dollars to save financial institutions from their own folly and the injuries that their folly creates for the people of our country. Some may argue that we have learned our lessons and left the low road behind us in the wake of the financial crisis. That may be true. I was tempted to think so in a speech I gave in February 2011 called "Putting the Low Road Behind Us," which focused on high-road and low-road models for mortgage servicing.1Yet we know that low-road business models exist and persist: for example, when we hear about billions of dollars of losses resulting from what were supposed to be conservative hedging strategies, or about the manipulation of key market interest rates. News like this causes the public to question the banking sector's commitment to the public welfare and its willingness to help the nation get back on its feet. And while I believe that most consumers understand that community banks did not, by and large, engage in the most egregious practices, institutions that continue to take the low road tar the image of the entire banking sector. A recentWall Street Journalarticle did a good job of characterizing how these events have affected the public's perception of the industry, saying: "Scandals emanating from the boom years should have lost their power to shock. But evidence unearthed by…regulators…is enough to stir even the most jaded cynic."2 The Role of RegulationNew regulation may not always be popular, but, when crafted appropriately, it can effectively alter the actions of those financial institutions that follow low-road business models. Given that the recent crisis in the financial system contributed to a sharp downturn in the economy that had broad effects, including the loss of millions of jobs, we have seen how all Americans are on the hook for financial institutions' decisions. The relationship between financial markets and the public compels decisionmakers to correct the adverse incentives and moral hazards created by low-road business models. In my view, though, the regulation of low-road banking models is not without cost. Indeed, some banking models are so complicated that they cannot be regulated without the expenditure of significant public or private dollars. When these business models have such a distant connection to meaningful financial intermediation, I believe that we as a society may very well want to rethink whether we want to support these business models at all. The costs of supporting them, simply put, may be prohibitive. Indeed, there may not be worthwhile regulatory approaches to all problems, even where the benefits of an activity outweigh the costs to regulate it. For example, when considering the "cost-to-regulate" perspective, some regulatory structures consist of rules that are based solely on metrics. While such rules may have the advantage of being less costly and easier to implement than a more subjective rule, as a regulator, I have to ask whether a metric-based rule will foster the development of internal controls, processes, and cultures that are capable of correcting the problems embedded in a low-road business model. Metrics-based oversight regimes do not work well in correcting misaligned incentives if the metrics in the regime can be manipulated. It is the potential of metrics manipulation that leads me to favor, in certain instances, clear restrictions on the scope of particularly unproductive activities. Let's look at the "Volcker Rule" and consider the benefits of a specific activity and the costs to regulate this activity. The Volcker Rule, which was included in the Dodd-Frank Act and should have the biggest impact on the largest and most complex financial institutions, prohibits proprietary trading by federally insured banks and their affiliates, such as broker-dealers. Proprietary trading by such financial institutions is a capital markets activity quite distinct from the prototypical banking relationship that exists to allocate financing from depositors to projects that produce value. I view proprietary trading as an activity of low or no real economic value that should not be part of any banking model that has an implicit government backstop. Nonetheless, the Volcker Rule, as written by Congress, provides limited exemptions to this proprietary trading ban, so activities that would otherwise constitute proprietary trading can be permitted if those activities constitute hedging or market-making and do not threaten the soundness of the bank or the stability of the financial system as a whole. Stated in terms of the analogy I have been using here, federally insured financial institutions and their affiliates can operate in narrow circumstances along the lines of a low-road banking model where there are sufficient guard rails in place to protect the integrity of the banking system. These guard rails are those limited exemptions based on safety and soundness and financial stability. The law mandates that the five regulators craft their implementing regulations to reflect the broad prohibition on proprietary trading activities by regulated banks, albeit with exemptions. The regulators then need to carefully examine whether exemptions like market-making or hedging can be conducted by the financial institution within the guard rails of safety and soundness and financial stability and therefore fit within the exemptions as Congress intended. I dissented in the vote for approval of the proposed implementation of the Volcker Rule. Let me say a bit about that dissent now. One reason for my vote was my sense that the proposed regulation's guard rails were insufficient. I was concerned that, as proposed, the guard rails were too broad and would allow banks to be able to go too far off the road. Further, I was concerned that the guard rails as crafted could be subject to significant abuse--abuse that would be very hard for even the best supervisors to catch. I feel it is very important that the guard rails be strong and be set very close to the road because of the potentially severe dangers of, and costs associated with, proprietary trading by institutions that have access to the federal safety net. In fact, it is not inconceivable to think that the potential costs associated with permitting hedging and market-making within these exemptions still outweigh the benefits we as a society supposedly receive from permitting these capital market activities. The potential compliance, supervisory, and other costs could be so great as to eliminate whatever value may arguably be derived by virtue of these capital market activities. What might such benefits be? Improved market liquidity and reduced credit spreads are among the benefits of proprietary trading I've heard discussed. First and foremost, it is traditional banking of the sort engaged in by community banks that promotes true liquidity in regions and within sectors, through deposit-taking and lending. Sure, liquidity in opaque financial markets may have increased in recent years by virtue of proprietary trading, but how has this market liquidity benefited consumers, retail investors, small business owners, and homeowners? Second, the Volcker Rule does not prohibit proprietary trading by all entities. Rather, it focuses solely on government-backstopped banks and their affiliates. Thus, even if federally insured banks are precluded from making markets, these markets can continue to be supported by conventional investment banks, hedge funds, and other financial market participants. Thus, any supposed impact by the Volcker Rule on overall market liquidity or credit spreads is, to me, questionable. Moreover, much of this so-called liquidity, especially in opaque over-the-counter markets, is potentially illusory and destabilizing, especially during adverse market conditions, which does not benefit the public. Indeed, proprietary trading involves buying and selling purely for speculative purposes that have little to do with a true assessment of a financial position's underlying value. Price discovery actually is impeded by this hyper-liquidity that is introduced by such speculation. This hyper-liquidity, motivated by nothing more than expectations of short-term price movements, creates inefficient subsidies to buyers and sellers with no compelling public benefit. I think that certain marketsshouldfeature large credit spreads because they involve truly risky products. Thus, a reduction in proprietary trading may have the effect of increasing spreads, but that is actually a publicbenefit, not a cost, because those wider spreads will more accurately reflect the risk involved in those positions. Indeed, banks backstopped by government funding are constrained in their ability to conduct market making, which only creates market pressure for financial instruments that represent proprietary trades to move to established exchanges where transparency is enhanced and exposure to counterparty default risk is greatly reduced. All of this is to say that liquidity is not an inherent public benefit that justifies the expenditure of significant compliance, oversight, examination, and enforcement costs. In other words, certain capital market activities for federally insured banks should not be supported by vast amounts of public and private expenditure. Taking the High RoadBut what does all of this have to do with you? Importantly, your being here at the Graduate School of Banking today means that you have embraced high-road business models for your banks. We need bankers like you to remind us of the positive role that you and your institutions play and how you contribute to the revival of a financial system that serves the goal of common and widespread prosperity. The path that we collectively travel is influenced by the fact that we live in a society populated by institutions with radically different business models: The low-road models can be incredibly large and complex or they can be small and predatory. Because there are costs associated with financial regulation, I am advocating that we understand the public benefits that the financial activity dictated by the model is intended to deliver. Is this our regulatory fate, to be weighed down as a society with the costs and burdens of regulating the complexity of our financial sector while promoting the public benefit of traditional community banking at the same time? I will not be able to supply you an answer in the next two minutes, but I will give you one small part of an answer. And that part is you. You are an essential ingredient for bringing innovation to real banking. Innovation comes in many forms, of course. To give one example, technology is revolutionizing banking, and that does not apply only to the largest banks. Depending on how old you are, you may take the ubiquity of technology for granted. But when I reflect on what I've seen and how different my teenagers' world is than the one that I grew up in, I can tell you that the pace of technological development in my own lifetime has been breathtaking. At the risk of dating myself, we have moved from a time when we still wrote our college term papers on typewriters to a time when the processing power of the phones in our pockets and purses is making even desktop computers increasingly irrelevant. (By the way, if you're wondering what a typewriter is, you can look it up on your smartphone.) Not surprisingly, banks have taken advantage of this trend and developed tools and systems to enhance both customer service and internal operations. Think about your own banks and how you interface with your customers. A number of customers may still prefer the personal touch of coming into the branch, but I'm also willing to bet that an increasing number of your customers expect to be able do business electronically when it is convenient for them, not necessarily during the bank's regular business hours. Going back to the automated teller machine and continuing through telephone banking, internet banking, and now mobile banking, the banking industry has strived to deploy technology to be more cost-efficient while meeting customer needs. Of course, the greater use of technology has its own risks as well, so I believe that community banks that are able to harness the power of technology while mitigating risks will be well positioned to better meet the demands of their customers in an innovative manner. Innovation is about much more than technology, however. You have a special responsibility--and ability--to combine your knowledge of your communities' financial needs with real relationship lending in a way that benefits your local markets and is profitable to your banks. As we have seen during the financial crisis, healthy, profitable banks are well positioned to continue lending to creditworthy borrowers. Your personal experience with the people of your towns---your knowledge of their needs and resources--is the best path toward maintaining a high-road business model. Your knowledge of how to pair the needs of your communities with holistic, boots-on-the-ground, due diligence and underwriting means that you have a powerful antidote to the mechanistic low-road approach to finance that has imperiled our economic well-being so palpably in recent years. With this knowledge, and the actions you take as bankers to implement that knowledge, you can be the engines of banking innovation and, in turn, promote regulatory innovation. Those of you who have been immersed in the needs of your communities and understand the fundamentals of your business models are poised to exercise not only intelligence, but also wisdom, judgment, empathy, and ethical rigor. We need you to show the nation how to plow the path toward a higher road. Thank you very much for your attention and best wishes in all of your work. 1.See "Putting the Low Road Behind Us," speech delivered at the 2011 Midwinter Housing Finance Conference, Park City, Utah, February 11.Return to text 2.Nixon, Simon (2012).
