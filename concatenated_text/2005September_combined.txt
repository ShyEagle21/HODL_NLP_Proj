Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Conference of State Bank Supervisors Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For Immediate Release September 1, 2005 Agencies Encourage Insured Depository Institutions to Assist Displaced Customers The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision (the agencies), and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors are asking insured depository institutions to consider all reasonable and prudent steps to assist customers' and credit union members' cash and financial needs in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. The agencies are working with state regulatory agencies, financial industry trade groups, and affected financial institutions to identify customer needs and monitor institutions' restoration of services. The agencies remind the public that deposit insurance is in full force and that money in FDIC- or NCUA-insured accounts is protected by federal deposit insurance. The agencies also note that a priority is to provide customer access to deposit accounts and other financial assets. Many financial institutions are implementing contingency plans, including procedures for consumers to have access to ATMs and use of their debit cards. The financial services community through its various trade associations is working together to assist affected institutions. The agencies encourage financial institutions to assist affected institutions and consider all reasonable and prudent actions that could help meet the critical financial needs of their customers and their communities. To the extent consistent with safe and sound banking practices, such actions may include: Waiving ATM fees for customers and non-customers Increasing ATM daily cash withdrawal limits Easing restrictions on cashing out-of-state and non-customer checks Waiving overdraft fees as a result of paycheck interruption Waiving early withdrawal penalties on time deposits Waiving availability restrictions on insurance checks Allowing loan customers to defer or skip some payments Waiving late fees for credit card and other loan balances due to interruption of mail and/or billing statements or the customer's inability to access funds Easing credit card limits and credit terms for new loans Delaying delinquency notices to the credit bureaus The agencies, in consultation with FinCEN, also encourage depository institutions to be reasonable in their approach to verifying the identity of individuals temporarily displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Under the Customer Identification Program requirement of the Bank Secrecy Act, depository institutions must obtain, at a minimum, an individual's name, address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number or other acceptable identification number before opening an account. The Customer Identification Program requirement provides depository institutions with flexibility to design a program that uses documents, non-documentary methods, or a combination to verify a customer's identity. Moreover, the regulation provides that verification of identity may be completed within a reasonable time after the account is opened. Recognizing the urgency of this situation, the agencies encourage depository institutions to use non-documentary verification methods for affected customers that may not be able to provide standard identification documents, as permitted under the regulation. A depository institution in the affected area, or dealing with new customers from the affected area, may amend its Customer Identification Program immediately and obtain required board approval for program changes as soon as practicable. The agencies note that these measures could help customers recover their financial strength and contribute to the health of the local community and the long-term interest of financial institutions and their customers when undertaken in a prudent manner. The agencies recognize that the needs and situation of each financial institution and its community and customers are unique. The actions above may not be feasible or desirable for all institutions and many institutions may provide additional services from those identified. The agencies will continue to monitor closely the situation and needs of insured depository institutions and their customers and will provide additional guidance, as required, to help address those needs. Institutions in need of assistance in dealing with customers affected by the hurricane should contact their primary supervisors. ### Media Contacts: Federal Reserve David Skidmore (202) 452-2955 CSBS Mary White (202) 728-5715 FDIC David Barr (202) 898-6992 NCUA or call (703) 518-6330 OCC Kevin Mukri (202) 874-5770 OTS Chris Smith (202) 906-6677 Federal Reserve David Skidmore (202) 452-2955 CSBS Mary White (202) 728-5715 FDIC David Barr (202) 898-6992 NCUA or call (703) 518-6330 OCC Kevin Mukri (202) 874-5770 OTS Chris Smith (202) 906-6677

For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced its approval of the application under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act by Associated Banc-Corp, Green Bay, to acquire State Financial Services Corporation, Milwaukee, and its subsidiary bank, State Financial Bank, National Association, Hales Corners, all of Wisconsin. Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action.
Testimony of Patrick Parkinson Deputy Director, Division of Research and Statistics Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate September 8, 2005 Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA) and on regulatory issues that have arisen in the context of the reauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The chairman's invitation letter requested that the testimony and written statement provide an overall evaluation of the CFMA and address three specific regulatory issues: (1) legislative measures to address fraud in certain retail foreign currency transactions; (2) portfolio margining for security futures products; and (3) futures on narrow-based securities indexes. Overall Evaluation of the CFMA The Federal Reserve Board believes that the CFMA has unquestionably been a successful piece of legislation. Most important, as recommended by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets in its 1999 report, it excluded transactions between institutions and other eligible counterparties in over-the-counter financial derivatives and foreign currency from regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). As the Working Group argued, regulation of such transactions under the CEA was unnecessary to achieve the act's principal objectives of deterring market manipulation and protecting investors. Such transactions are not readily susceptible to manipulation and eligible counterparties can and should be expected to protect themselves against fraud and counterparty credit losses. Exclusion of these transactions resolved long-standing concerns that a court might find that the CEA applied to these transactions, thereby making them legally unenforceable. At the same time, the CFMA modernized the regulation of U.S. futures exchanges, replacing a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation with an approach that recognizes that the regulatory regime necessary and appropriate to achieve the objectives of the CEA depends on the nature of the underlying assets traded and the capabilities of market participants. Together, these provisions of the CFMA have made our financial system and our economy more flexible and resilient by facilitating the transfer and dispersion of risk. Consequently, the Board believes that major amendments to the regulatory framework established by the CFMA are unnecessary and unwise. Nonetheless, the Board supports some targeted amendments to the CEA to address persistent problems with fraud in retail foreign currency transactions and to facilitate the trading of security futures products and futures on security indexes. Fraud in Retail Foreign Currency Transactions In its 1999 report, the President's Working Group concluded that, to address problems associated with foreign currency "bucket shops," the CEA should be applied to transactions in foreign currency futures if they are entered into between a retail customer (an individual or business that does not meet the definition of an eligible counterparty) and an entity that is neither federally regulated nor affiliated with a federally regulated entity. The CFMA included provisions that were largely consistent with the Working Group's recommendation. The CFMA has allowed the CFTC to take numerous enforcement actions against retail foreign currency fraud. However, the CFTC has continued to encounter certain difficulties in this area. These difficulties have stemmed from two sources. First, the CFTC's authority is limited to foreign currency futures, and some entities have fraudulently marketed contracts that, although similar to futures, have characteristics that have led some courts to conclude that they are not futures and that the CFTC has no jurisdiction. Second, some perpetrators of fraud have taken advantage of the CFMA's exclusion from CFTC jurisdiction of retail foreign currency futures offered by futures commission merchants (FCMs) and their affiliates. These perpetrators have set up thinly capitalized FCMs and used affiliates of those FCMs or unregulated unaffiliated entities to fraudulently solicit retail customers. The Board believes that fraud undermines the functioning of financial markets and that some governmental entity must have the authority to protect retail investors in foreign currencies by taking enforcement action against entities that are defrauding them. Although the states have an important role to play in combating fraud, the President's Working Group concluded in 1999 that the CFTC is the appropriate federal regulator and should have clear authority to pursue retail fraud by foreign currency bucket shops. Consequently, the Board supports targeted amendments to the CEA that address the specific difficulties that the CFTC has encountered in taking enforcement action in this area. It is critical that those amendments be carefully crafted to avoid creating legal or regulatory uncertainty for legitimate businesses providing foreign exchange services to retail clients. The Board would be opposed to extending any new CFTC authority to retail transactions in other commodities without further careful consideration and demonstrated need. Provisions crafted to avoid creating uncertainty for legitimate foreign currency businesses are unlikely to provide the same protection to a much wider range of businesses. Portfolio Margining for Security Futures The CFMA gave the Board authority to prescribe regulations establishing initial and maintenance margins for security futures products or to delegate that authority jointly to the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Board delegated its authority to the commissions in a letter dated March 6, 2001. The letter indicated that the Board concluded that delegation is appropriate because it believes that the most important function of margin regulations is prudential--that is, to protect margin lenders from credit losses. In the case of security futures, the lenders are broker-dealers and FCMs, and the commissions are responsible for all other aspects of prudential regulation of those firms. Portfolio margining is a method for setting margin requirements that evaluates positions as a group or portfolio and takes into account the potential for losses on some positions to be offset by gains on others. Specifically, the margin requirement for a portfolio is typically set equal to an estimate of the largest possible decline in the net value of the portfolio that could occur under assumed changes in market conditions. Portfolio margining is an alternative to "strategy-based" margining. With strategy-based margining, the potential for gains on one position in a portfolio to offset losses on another position is taken into account only if the portfolio implements one of a designated set of recognized trading strategies. The margin requirements for recognized strategies are set out in the rules of self-regulatory organizations. Each strategy is viewed in isolation; the remainder of the portfolio and other strategies are not taken into account. The Board has supported the use of portfolio margining for some time. For example, in 1998 the Board amended Regulation T to allow securities exchanges to develop portfolio margining as an alternative to strategy-based margining, subject to SEC approval. In its 2001 letter delegating its authority over margins for security futures products jointly to the CFTC and the SEC, the Board requested that the commissions, either jointly or individually, report to the Board annually on their experience exercising the delegated authority and to include in those reports an assessment of progress toward portfolio margining for securities futures products. The Board continues to believe that portfolio margining is both more risk-sensitive and more efficient than strategy-based margining. Unfortunately, to date no progress has been made toward portfolio margining of security futures products. Because the CFMA stipulates that margin requirements for security futures products must be consistent with margin requirements on comparable securities options, progress for security futures requires progress on options. Although margin requirements for options have for many years been portfolio-based at the clearing level, customer margins were until very recently strictly strategy-based. However, in July the SEC approved rule changes that create a two-year pilot program that would permit portfolio margining of options and futures positions in broad-based stock indexes held by customers with a minimum account equity of $5 million or more. If this pilot program were adopted as a margining system available to all customers for a broader range of products, significant progress toward portfolio margining of securities futures products would become possible. The Commodity Exchange Reauthorization Act of 2005, which the Senate Agriculture Committee approved in July, proposes to make progress on portfolio margining (1) by eliminating the need for margins required on security futures to be consistent with those required on comparable options and (2) by substituting CFTC oversight of security futures margins for joint regulation by the CFTC and the SEC under delegation from the Board. This approach would be a marked departure from the regulatory regime for security futures that was established by the CFMA. The Board believes that it is appropriate for the Congress to spur progress toward portfolio margining for security futures but that this can be accomplished without changing so fundamentally the regulatory regime for security futures margins. For example, the Congress could spur more-rapid progress toward portfolio margining for both security futures products and options by requiring the commissions to jointly adopt regulations permitting the use of risk-based portfolio margin requirements for security futures products within a short but reasonable time period and requiring the SEC to approve risk-based portfolio margin requirements for options within the same period. Futures on Narrow-Based Securities Indexes The CFMA distinguished between futures on broad-based security indexes, which are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC, and futures on narrow-based securities indexes, which are considered security futures products and, as such, are subject to joint CFTC and SEC jurisdiction. Some futures exchanges argue that the definition of a narrow-based index in the CFMA was drafted with reference to the U.S. equities markets and that, in any event, the definition unnecessarily restricts the trading of futures on indexes of U.S. debt obligations and foreign securities. The 2005 Reauthorization Act would address those concerns by requiring the CFTC and the SEC to jointly promulgate a revised definition of a narrow-based securities index that would better reflect capitalization, trading patterns, and trade reporting in the underlying markets. Such a definition would permit futures on indexes of U.S. debt obligations and foreign securities to trade as broad-based indexes if the indexes are not readily susceptible to manipulation. Although the Board does not have a strong interest in this issue, it favors taking another look at the appropriateness of applying the existing definition of a narrow-based index to indexes of foreign securities. First, for many years several futures on foreign equity indexes have been trading abroad and have been offered to customers in the United States. Although these indexes would be considered narrow-based indexes under the existing definition, we see no evidence that these indexes have been susceptible to manipulation. Second, the provision in the 2005 Reauthorization Act can be seen as simply reiterating an existing requirement in the CFMA that the CFTC and the SEC jointly adopt rules that define narrow-based indexes based on foreign securities.

Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For Immediate Release September 15, 2005 Data Show Continued Improvement in Credit Quality, Slight Increase in Credit Commitment Volume The quality of syndicated bank credits showed continued improvement this year, according to the Shared National Credit (SNC) review released today by federal bank and thrift regulators. The review, which encompassed credits of at least $20 million that are shared by three or more financial institutions, also found that most industries exhibit much improved credit quality from peak problem levels experienced only a few years ago. The results--reported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision--are based on analyses prepared in the second quarter of 2005 and reflect business and economic conditions at that time. Total classified credit commitments (those rated as either substandard, doubtful or loss) fell by $21.5 billion, or 29 percent, from the previous year, compared with a net decrease of $78.2 billion, or 51 percent, the year before. Commitments rated special mention decreased by $7.0 billion, or 21 percent, in contrast to 2004 when they fell by $22.4 billion, or 41 percent. None of these figures includes the effects of hedging or other techniques that organizations often employ to mitigate risk. The ratio of classified credit commitments to total commitments fell to 3.2 percent, the lowest level since 1999. Total adversely rated credits (classified and special mention combined) also fell considerably, to 4.8 percent of total commitments (see Chart 1 below). Overview In aggregate, the 2005 SNC Program covered 6,817 credits totaling $1.6 trillion in credit commitments to 4,579 borrowers. Total commitments were up by 5.3 percent from the prior year, the first increase since 2001. However, the current level is 21 percent below the 2001 peak of $2.0 trillion. The increase in 2005 total commitments is consistent with market data pointing to higher customer demand and increased competition among a variety of lenders to provide new funds. Total outstandings, or drawn amounts, of $522 billion were up 4 percent from the prior year. For the 2005 review, total credit commitments classified as substandard fell $10.9 billion, or 20 percent from the prior year, while doubtful credits dropped by $6.9 billion or 55 percent (see Table 1 below). Commitments classified as loss fell $3.7 billion, down 58 percent from the prior year. The portion of outstanding nonaccrual classified credits fell to $19.3 billion. Table 1 SNC Classifications ($ billions) Total Commitments % Change 2004 - 2005 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Substandard -20% 44.2 55.1 112.2 112.0 86.9 Doubtful -55% 5.6 12.5 29.3 26.1 22.6 Loss -58% 2.7 6.4 10.7 19.1 7.8 Total Classified -29% 52.5 74.0 152.2 157.1 117.3 Percent of Commitments 3.2% 4.8% 9.3% 8.4% 5.7% Memo: Nonaccrual classified -36% 19.3 30.1 51.0 51.0 N/A Special Mention -21% 25.9 32.8 55.2 79.0 75.5 Total Criticized -27% 78.4 106.8 207.5 236.1 192.8 Percent of Commitments 4.8% 6.9% 12.6% 12.6% 9.4% Total SNC Commitments 5.3% 1,627 1,545 1,644 1,871 2,050 Industry Trends The quality of syndicated credits improved in most industries (see Appendix B) . The strongest improvement in dollar terms occurred in the Oil, Gas, Pipelines and Utilities, with a $10.2 billion, or 42 percent, decline in classified commitments. However, the level of classified credits in this segment remains significantly elevated, with 7.5 percent of commitments classified. Telecommunications and Cable was the only segment to exhibit an increase in classification levels, largely due to the migration of credits previously criticized into the classified categories. Well-documented problems facing the airline industry continue to drive classifications in the Lodging and Transportation segment. The remaining segments showed modest classification rates that were below the average those for the entire SNC program. Credits identified for special mention fell by $7.0 billion, or 21 percent, with strong declines experienced in most industries except Manufacturing. This segment experienced a notable increase in special mention volume due to problems in the automotive manufacturing sector. Of total loss classifications in 2005, $1.1 billion, or 42 percent, were directly attributable to the energy sector, most of which is related to outcomes of bankruptcy filings. The remaining losses were spread across a variety of industries. Trends by Entity Type During 2005, the share of SNC commitments held by U.S. banks edged down 1 percentage point to 45 percent. Over the past several years, lenders not affiliated with banks, such as brokerage firms, mutual funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds, have taken on larger positions in the SNC program. These nonbank entities have increased their share to 13 percent compared to 8 percent four years ago. Compared to last year, the share held by foreign banking organizations (FBOs) held steady at 42 percent in 2005 (see Table 2). U.S. banks and FBOs showed a decrease in classified assets, while nonbank classifications increased from the prior year. The quality of holdings also varied among entity types, with classifieds amounting to 1.6 percent of total commitments at U.S. banks, compared with 2.3 percent at FBOs and 11.7 percent at nonbanks. Total nonaccrual outstandings improved for all entity types. Most notably, U.S. banks experienced a 42 percent decline.

Risk Management by Banks Banking organizations remain vigilant in identifying problem credits and have generally reflected the appropriate risk rating in their internal ratings of credits in the SNC program. Although credit quality has improved, banking organizations must continue to carefully monitor the condition of their borrowers to ensure that they promptly identify and address any emerging weaknesses and adjust loan loss allowance levels appropriately.

Credits include syndicated loans and loan commitments, letters of credit, commercial leases, as well as other forms of credit. Credit commitments include both drawn and undrawn portions of credit facilities. This release reports only the par amounts of commitments; these may differ from the amounts at which loans are carried by investors. 2. The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program was established in 1977 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In 2001 the Office of Thrift Supervision became an assisting agency. With a few exceptions, the annual program, which seeks to provide an efficient and consistent review and classification of large syndicated loans, generally covers loans or loan commitments of at least $20 million that are shared by three or more financial institutions. 3. Adversely rated credits (also known as criticized credits) are the total of credits classified substandard, doubtful, and loss - and credits rated special mention. Classified credits are only those rated substandard, doubtful, and loss. Under the agencies' Uniform Loan Classification Standards, classified credits have well-defined weaknesses, including default in some cases. Special mention credits exhibit potential weaknesses, which may result in further deterioration if left uncorrected. Excerpt from Federal Reserve's SR Letter 79-556 defining regulatory classifications: Classification ratings are defined as "Substandard," "Doubtful," and "Loss." A Substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. An asset classified as Doubtful has all the weakness inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make the collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as Loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future. Excerpt from June 10, 1993 Interagency Statement on the Supervisory Definition of Special Mention Assets: A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution's credit position at some future date. Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 4. Nonaccrual loans are defined for regulatory reporting purposes as "loans and lease financing receivables that are required to be reported on a nonaccrual basis because (a) they are maintained on a cash basis due to a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower, (b) payment in full of interest or principal is not expected, or (c) principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or longer, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection." In Table 1, nonaccrual classifieds are those funded or outstanding portions of loans classified as substandard and doubtful which are not accruing interest. For 2005, this consisted of $14.8 billion in loans rated substandard and $4.5 billion rated doubtful. 5. Note that the current industry totals categorize borrowers using 2002 NAICS codes, in contrast to prior release of SNC data which categorized borrowers using 1997 NAICS codes. 6. Nonbanks include a wide range of institutional investors. 7. For further guidance, institutions should refer to the July 12, 1999 Joint Interagency Letter to Financial Institutions on the allowance for loan losses, as well as the July 2, 2001 Interagency Policy Statement on Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) Methodologies and Documentation for Banks and Savings Institutions. 8. NAICS groupings of industries identified in Appendix B are as follows: Telecommunication & Cable - 5132 through 51339; Manufacturing - 31 through 33 and 5121 through 5131; Professional, Scientific, and Other Services - 54, 55, 56, 61, and 62; Oil, Gas, Pipelines, and Utilities - 21 (oil- & gas-related only), 22, and 486; Construction & Real Estate - 23 and 53; Lodging and Transportation - 48 (excluding 486), 49, and 72; Financial Services and Insurance - 52; and All Other - remaining NAICS codes. Prior year data has been restated to reflect industry categorizations using 2002 NAICS groupings rather than 1997 NAICS groupings used in prior data releases.

Testimony of Governor Mark Olson Regulatory relief Before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives September 22, 2005 Chairman Bachus, Representative Sanders, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on H.R. 3505, the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2005, and other issues related to regulatory relief. The Board is aware of the current and growing regulatory burden that is imposed on this nation's banking organizations. Often this burden falls particularly hard on small institutions, which have fewer resources than larger institutions. The Board strongly supports the efforts of Congress to review periodically the federal banking laws to determine whether they can be streamlined without compromising the safety and soundness of banking organizations, consumer protections, or other important objectives that Congress has established for the financial system. Developing regulatory relief legislation that appropriately balances burden reduction and sound public policy is no easy task, and I commend the Subcommittee for again addressing the issue of regulatory relief. In 2003, at Chairman Oxley's request, the Board provided a number of legislative proposals that we believe would improve the banking laws and relieve unnecessary burden. Since then, the Board has continued to work with the other federal banking agencies and Committee staff on regulatory relief matters and has supported several additional regulatory relief proposals. I am pleased to note that some of the Board's most important legislative recommendations--including those authorizing depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits, permitting the Federal Reserve to pay interest on balances held by depository institutions at Reserve Banks, and providing the Board greater flexibility in setting reserve requirements--were passed by the full House earlier this year as part of H.R. 1224, the Business Checking Freedom Act of 2005. A number of the Board's other legislative suggestions are incorporated into H.R. 3505, and we look forward to working with Congress, our fellow banking agencies and other interested parties in developing, analyzing and perfecting other potential regulatory relief proposals as the legislative process moves forward. Federal Reserve Response to Hurricane Katrina Before turning to the provisions of H.R. 3505, I'd like to spend a few moments reviewing the steps that the Federal Reserve has taken to maintain and restore vital financial services to the people of the Gulf Coast--including those who remain in the region and those who have been forced by Hurricane Katrina to relocate outside the region. At the outset, I want to express our heartfelt sympathy to all of the individuals and families who have suffered so much in the past few weeks, including the employees of the New Orleans Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and to acknowledge the very brave efforts of many individuals to save lives, help the sick and displaced, and restore public order. The Federal Reserve System, and particularly the Atlanta Reserve Bank, took a number of important steps immediately following Hurricane Katrina to assist depository institutions and customers affected by the disaster. For example, the Atlanta Reserve Bank and other Federal Reserve offices quickly adjusted their operations to allow the cash services normally supplied by the New Orleans Branch to be provided by other offices in the region. These offices have remained open each weekend since the disaster to help ensure that all depository institutions get the cash services they need and can service the critical cash needs of individuals and businesses in the region. More recently, we have begun special deliveries of cash to designated distribution points in the most affected areas to reduce the transportation burdens and expenses on depository institutions in these areas. As relief and recovery efforts began, the restoration of check clearing became increasingly important. We quickly shifted the processing of checks normally handled by our New Orleans office to Atlanta and worked with numerous individual institutions to address the special processing issues facing these institutions. To help ease some of the burden in check clearing, during the week of September 5, we began giving credit for checks deposited by banks in the New Orleans territory as if these checks were still being processed normally in New Orleans. We also did not return checks when we were unable to present them to severely affected institutions. Instead, we held those checks and worked closely with the institutions' primary supervisors to determine how and when we could restart normal check relationships with these institutions. Currently, we can present checks to all of the institutions that had service from the Federal Reserve prior to Katrina, although often at alternative locations. The Atlanta Reserve Bank also reminded the depository institutions it serves that, as usual, the discount window is available to assist in meeting their liquidity needs. We have been in contact with many depository institutions in the affected areas and are carefully monitoring the situation. At this time, we have not seen evidence of significant funding difficulties or problems in balance sheet management. In Washington, we have worked closely with the other regulatory agencies in encouraging financial institutions to consider all reasonable and prudent steps to ease burdens on persons that have been so deeply affected by Katrina. These steps may include waiving ATM fees for customers and non-customers, increasing ATM daily cash withdrawal limits, allowing loan customers to defer or skip some payments, waiving late fees for credit card and other loan balances, and delaying delinquency notices to credit bureaus. The banking agencies, working in conjunction with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), also have encouraged depository institutions to use the flexibility already embedded in existing regulations to use non-documentary methods to verify the identity of customers who may not have access to their normal identification documents due to the hurricane. At this point, the banking industry on the whole has responded well to this challenging situation, showing resilience and flexibility. While the challenges have by no means passed, banks appear to be taking appropriate actions to get their customers access to cash and banking services. For our part, the Board has sought to assure institutions in the affected area that we will exercise prudence, discretion, and flexibility where possible and appropriate in fulfilling our supervisory and regulatory responsibilities. In this regard, we recognize that efforts by banking organizations to work with affected borrowers may cause an institution's levels of delinquent and nonperforming loans to increase. However, these actions, when conducted prudently, also can help protect the long-term viability of the institution, contribute to the local community and promote recovery. We also have recognized that the disaster may well impact the ability of banking organizations to comply with a variety of regulatory filing and other requirements. For this reason, we have publicly announced that the Federal Reserve will consider the unusual circumstances that organizations in the affected area have faced with respect to safety and soundness and compliance issues in determining what, if any, supervisory response is appropriate. We also have reminded banking organizations that the Federal Reserve will favorably consider activities that revitalize or stabilize designated disaster areas, especially those activities that benefit low- and moderate-income individuals or areas, in reviewing an institution's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act. On a broader level, we also are cognizant of the concerns expressed by banking organizations regarding the burdens of complying with certain Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements. We recognize that provisions of the BSA require considerable effort by the banking industry to obtain, document and provide relevant financial information to support criminal investigations by law enforcement. To further promote the uniform application of BSA/anti-money laundering requirements, the federal banking agencies, working with FinCEN, recently issued a joint BSA/AML Examination Manual. The Board will continue to work with our fellow banking agencies and FinCEN to address key issues related to BSA/anti-money laundering compliance. With respect to currency transaction reports (CTRs), we support the efforts of the Treasury Department and others to develop ways of reducing the burdens imposed on banks in ways that would not adversely affect the ability of banks to manage their risk or unintentionally impede the investigative tools available to law enforcement. De Novo Interstate Branching Turning back to H.R. 3505, the Board strongly supports those aspects of the bill that would remove outdated barriers to de novo interstate branching by banks. Since enactment of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal Act), all fifty states have permitted banks to expand on an interstate basis through the acquisition of an existing bank in their state. Interstate banking is not only good for banks, it is good for consumers and the economy. While the number of banks has fallen in recent years, the number of branches has risen sharply to more than 71,000 in 2004 compared with approximately 50,000 in 1990. More than 2,000 branches were opened by banks in 2004 alone. The creation of new branches helps maintain the competitiveness and dynamism of the American banking industry and improve access to banking services in otherwise under-served markets. It results in better banking services for households and small businesses, lower interest rates on loans, and higher interest rates on deposits. Interstate branching also increases convenience for customers who live, work, and operate across state borders. However, the Riegle-Neal Act permitted banks to open a branch in a new state without acquiring another bank only if the host state enacted legislation that expressly permits entry by de novo branching (an opt-in requirement). To date, twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of opt-in legislation, while twenty-nine states continue to require interstate entry through the acquisition of an existing bank. This limitation on de novo branching is an obstacle to interstate entry for all banks and also creates special problems for small banks seeking to operate across state lines. Moreover, it creates an unlevel playing field between banks and federal savings associations, which have long been allowed to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis. H.R. 3505 would remove this last obstacle to full interstate branching for banks and level the playing field between banks and thrifts by allowing banks to establish interstate branches on a de novo basis. The bill also would remove the parallel provision that allows states to impose a minimum requirement on the age of banks that are acquired by an out-of-state banking organization. These changes would allow banks, including in particular small banks near state borders, to better serve their customers by establishing new interstate branches and acquiring newly chartered banks across state lines. It also would increase competition by providing banks a less costly method for offering their services at new locations. The establishment and operation of any new interstate branches would continue to be subject to the other regulatory provisions and conditions established by Congress for de novo interstate branches, including the financial, managerial, and community reinvestment requirements set forth in the Riegle-Neal Act. While the Board supports expanding the de novo branching authority of banks, the Board continues to believe that Congress should not grant this new branching authority to industrial loan companies (ILCs) unless the corporate owners of these institutions are subject to the same type of consolidated supervision and activities restrictions as the corporate owners of other full-service insured banks. I will explain the reasons for the Board's position more fully later. Small Bank Examination Flexibility Another important section of the bill would expand the number of small institutions that qualify for an extended examination cycle. Federal law currently requires that the appropriate federal banking agency conduct an on-site examination of each insured depository institution at least once every twelve months. The statute, however, permits institutions that have $250 million or less in assets and that meet certain capital, managerial, and other criteria to be examined on an eighteen-month cycle. As the primary federal supervisors for state-chartered banks, the Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) may alternate responsibility for conducting these examinations with the appropriate state supervisory authority if the Board or FDIC determines that the state examination carries out the purposes of the statute. The $250 million asset cutoff for an eighteen-month examination cycle has not been raised since 1994. The Board, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of Thrift Supervision unanimously support raising this asset cap from $250 million to $500 million. Doing so would provide meaningful relief to small institutions without jeopardizing the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions. In this regard, raising the threshold to $500 million would potentially allow approximately an additional 1,100 insured depository institutions to qualify for an eighteen-month examination cycle. The Board, however, does not support raising the asset threshold for an eighteen-month examination cycle to $1 billion, as section 607 of the bill would do. Institutions that have assets approaching $1 billion tend to have more complex risk profiles and are more likely to operate business lines on a regional or national basis than institutions with assets of less than $500 million. For these reasons, the Board believes that institutions with assets of more than $500 million should continue to be subject to a twelve-month safety and soundness exam cycle. The Board also does not support a separate provision of the bill (section 601), which would allow a federal banking agency to extend the twelve- or eighteen-month examination cycle for an institution of any size, and for a potentially indefinite period of time, in order to allocate and conserve the agency's examination resources. Despite advances in off-site monitoring, the Board continues to believe that regular on-site examinations play a critical role in helping bank supervisors detect and correct asset, risk-management, or internal control problems at an institution before these problems result in claims on the deposit insurance funds. These lessons were learned during the thrift and banking crises of the 1980s and were the reason Congress established the mandatory exam cycles in 1991. These mandatory on-site examination cycles impose important discipline on the federal banking agencies, ensure that insured depository institutions do not go unexamined for extended periods, and have contributed significantly to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions. If an agency is experiencing shortages in its examination resources, we believe it would be better to address these constraints through the supplementation of the agency's resources, rather than by extending the mandated frequency of safety and soundness examinations. Permit the Board to Grant Exceptions to Attribution Rule H.R. 3505 includes another amendment that the Board proposed and that we believe will help banking organizations maintain attractive benefits programs for their employees. The Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act) generally prohibits a bank holding company from owning, in the aggregate, more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any company without the Board's approval. The BHC Act also provides that any shares held by a trust for the benefit of a bank holding company's shareholders or employees are deemed to be controlled by the bank holding company itself. This attribution rule was intended to prevent a bank holding company from using a trust established for the benefit of its management, shareholders, or employees to evade the BHC Act=s restrictions on the acquisition of shares of banks and nonbanking companies. While this attribution rule has proved to be a useful tool in preventing evasions of the BHC Act, it does not always provide an appropriate result. For example, it may not be appropriate to apply the attribution rule when the shares in question are acquired by a 401(k) plan that is widely held by, and operated for the benefit of, the employees of the bank holding company. In these situations, the bank holding company may not have the ability to influence the purchase or sale decisions of the employees or otherwise control the shares that are held by the plan in trust for its employees. The bill would allow the Board to address these situations by authorizing the Board to grant exceptions from the attribution rule where appropriate. Reduce Cross-Marketing Restrictions Another amendment proposed by the Board and included in the bill would modify the cross-marketing restrictions imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act) on the merchant banking and insurance company investments of financial holding companies. The GLB Act generally prohibits a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company from engaging in cross-marketing activities with a nonfinancial company that is owned by the same financial holding company under the GLB Act's merchant banking or insurance company investment authorities. However, the GLB Act currently permits a depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company, with Board approval, to engage in limited cross-marketing activities through statement stuffers and Internet websites with nonfinancial companies that are held under the act's insurance company investment authority (but not the act's merchant banking authority). The bill would allow depository institutions controlled by a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with companies held under the merchant banking authority to the same extent, and subject to the same restrictions, as companies held under the insurance company investment authority. We believe that this parity of treatment is appropriate, and see no reason to treat the merchant banking and insurance investments of financial holding companies differently for purposes of the cross-marketing restrictions of the GLB Act. The bill also would liberalize the cross-marketing restrictions that apply to both merchant banking and insurance company investments. This aspect of the amendment would permit a depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with a nonfinancial company held under either the merchant banking or insurance company investment authority if the nonfinancial company is not controlled by the financial holding company. When a financial holding company does not control a portfolio company, cross-marketing activities are unlikely to materially undermine the separation between the nonfinancial portfolio company and the financial holding company's depository institution subsidiaries. Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement Another section of the bill (section 616) would direct the Board to propose for comment certain changes to its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, including an increase in the asset threshold below which a bank holding company (BHC) qualifies as a "small" BHC for purposes of the Policy Statement. I am pleased to report that the Board already has taken steps to raise this asset threshold. As a general matter, the Board has discouraged BHCs from using debt to finance the acquisition of banks or nonbank companies because high levels of debt at a parent BHC can impair the parent's ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks. The Board has recognized, however, that small community-based BHCs may have less access to the capital markets and equity financing than larger BHCs and that, therefore, the use of acquisition debt may be needed to permit or facilitate the transfer of ownership of small banks. For this reason, the Policy Statement permits small BHCs to have higher levels of acquisition debt (and lower capital-to-asset ratios) than would otherwise be permitted for larger BHCs. Currently, a BHC is considered "small" for purposes of the Policy Statement if it has less than $150 million in consolidated assets and meets certain other conditions. The Policy Statement also contains certain ongoing restrictions on BHCs that operate under the Statement, which are designed to help ensure that these BHCs do not present an undue risk to the safety and soundness of their subsidiary banks. Earlier this month, the Board requested public comment on proposed changes to the Policy Statement. These proposed changes would, among other things, raise the asset threshold in the Policy Statement from $150 million to $500 million in consolidated assets. With this proposed change, approximately 85 percent of all top-tier BHCs--or approximately 4,400 companies--would qualify for the Policy Statement. Raising the threshold to $500 million, as the Board has proposed, also goes well beyond the level (approximately $340 million) that would be needed to adjust the current threshold for inflation since it was established. The Board also has announced plans to propose revisions to its regulatory reporting framework to accommodate the changes proposed to the Policy Statement, which should further lower reporting and compliance costs for small BHCs. This proposal balances the goals of facilitating the transfer of ownership of small banks, on the one hand, and ensuring capital adequacy and access to necessary supervisory information on the other hand. Of course, the Board will carefully review the comments that we receive on this proposal. Industrial Loan Companies As I noted earlier, the Board strongly supports allowing banks to open de novo branches on an interstate basis. The Board, however, opposes provisions, like those contained in H.R. 3505, that would grant this new authority to ILCs that operate under a special exemption in federal law. ILCs are state-chartered FDIC-insured banks that were first established early in the twentieth century to make small loans to industrial workers. As insured banks, ILCs are supervised by the FDIC as well as by the chartering state. However, under a special exemption in current law, any type of company, including a commercial or retail firm, may acquire an ILC in a handful of states--principally Utah, California, and Nevada--and avoid the activity restrictions and supervisory requirements imposed on bank holding companies under the federal BHC Act. When the special exemption for ILCs was initially granted in 1987, ILCs were mostly small, local institutions that did not offer demand deposits or other types of checking accounts. In light of these facts, Congress conditioned the exemption on a requirement that any ILCs chartered after 1987 remain small (below $100 million in assets) or refrain from offering demand deposits that are withdrawable by check or similar means. This special exemption has been aggressively exploited since 1987. Some grandfathered states have allowed their ILCs to exercise many of the same powers as commercial banks and have begun to charter new ILCs. Today, several ILCs are owned by large, internationally active financial or commercial firms and a large retail firm recently applied to establish an exempt ILC. In addition, a number of ILCs themselves have grown large, with one holding more than $50 billion in deposits and an additional six each holding more than $1 billion in deposits. Affirmatively granting ILCs the ability to open de novo branches nationwide would significantly expand the attractiveness of this loophole and further blur any remaining distinction between ILCs and full-service insured banks. This result would be inconsistent with both the historical functions of ILCs and the terms of their special exemption in current law. Because the parent companies of exempt ILCs are not subject to the BHC Act, authorizing ILCs to open de novo branches nationwide would create an unlevel competitive playing field among banking organizations and undermine the framework Congress has established for the corporate owners of full-service banks. It would allow firms that are not subject to the consolidated supervisory framework of the BHC Act--including consolidated capital, examination, and reporting requirements--to own and control an insured bank with nationwide offices. It also would allow a foreign bank to acquire control of an insured bank and operate the bank anywhere in the United States without meeting the requirement under the BHC Act that the foreign bank be subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis in its home country. In addition, it would allow financial firms to operate a nationwide insured bank without complying with the capital, managerial, and Community Reinvestment Act requirements established by Congress in the GLB Act. Congress has established consolidated supervision as a fundamental component of bank supervision in the United States because consolidated supervision provides important protection to the insured banks that are part of a larger organization and to the federal safety net that supports those banks. Financial trouble in one part of an organization can spread rapidly to other parts. To protect an insured bank that is part of a larger organization, a supervisor needs to have the authority and tools to understand the risks that exist within the parent organization and its affiliates and, if necessary, address any significant capital, managerial, or other deficiencies before they pose a danger to the bank. This is particularly true today, as holding companies increasingly manage their operations--and the risks that arise from these operations--in a centralized manner that cuts across legal entities. Risks that cross legal entities and that are managed on a consolidated basis simply cannot be monitored properly through supervision directed at one, or even several, of the legal entities within the overall organization. For these reasons, Congress since 1956 has required that the parent companies of full-service insured banks be subject to consolidated supervision under the BHC Act. In addition, following the collapse of Bank of Commerce and Credit International, Congress has required that foreign banks seeking to acquire control of a U.S. bank under the BHC Act be subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis in the foreign bank's home country. Authorizing exempt ILCs to open de novo branches nationwide would undermine this framework. It also would take away from Congress the important decision--recently reaffirmed in the GLB Act--regarding the appropriate limits on the affiliation of banks and commercial entities. This loophole allows any type of company, including a retail or commercial firm, to own an exempt ILC without regard to the activity restrictions in the BHC Act that are designed to maintain the separation of banking and commerce. In an attempt to address the issues associated with the mixing of banking and commerce, H.R. 3505 places certain limits on the types of ILCs that may open de novo interstate branches. However, the limits contained in the bill do not adequately address these important issues. For example, the bill would allow any ILC that received FDIC insurance before October 1, 2003, or had an application for deposit insurance pending on that date, to open de novo branches nationwide so long as the institution does not experience a change in control. Thus, the bill would allow those commercial and retail firms that acquired an ILC before October 1, 2003, to transform the institution into a nationwide retail bank. Even those ILCs that are established or acquired after October 1, 2003, would be permitted to open interstate de novo branches unless an appropriate state supervisor for the ILC affirmatively determined that a company controlling the ILC derived more than 15 percent of its annual gross revenues from activities that are not "financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity." Importantly, the bill does not define these terms by reference to the GLB Act or otherwise establish any standards for a state authority to use in determining what activities are "financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity." Instead, the bill leaves this important determination--which has the potential to undermine the nation's longstanding policy of maintaining the separation of banking and commerce--to the discretion of the ILC's state supervisors. Moreover, unlike the grandfather provisions of the GLB Act on which the ILC provisions of the bill purportedly are based ( see 12 U.S.C. ï¿½ 1843(n)), H.R. 3505 would not require a company that acquires an ILC after October 1, 2003, to divest its non-financial, commercial activities within a specified period of time. The limits contained in H.R. 3505 also do not address the other risks and issues presented by ILCs. For example, the bill fails to address the supervisory issues associated with allowing domestic firms or foreign banks that are not subject to consolidated supervision to operate an FDIC-insured bank on a nationwide basis. The bill also fails to address the equity issues raised by enhancing a loophole that is available to only one type of financial institution chartered in a handful of states. Let me be clear. The Board does not oppose granting ILCs the ability to open de novo branches if the corporate owners of ILCs that exercise these expanded powers are covered by the same supervisory and regulatory framework that applies to the owners of other full-service insured banks. Stated simply, if ILCs want to benefit from expanded powers granted other insured banks, then they and their corporate parents should be subject to the same rules that apply to the owners of other insured banks. The Board believes that important principles governing the structure of the nation's banking system--such as consolidated supervision, the separation of banking and commerce, and the maintenance of a level playing field for all competitors in the financial services marketplace--should not be abandoned without careful consideration by the Congress. These matters deserve hearings and careful deliberation because they have the potential to change the landscape of our financial system and should not be considered as non-controversial regulatory relief matters. Conclusion I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the Board's legislative suggestions and priorities concerning regulatory relief. Besides the items that I have highlighted in my testimony, the bill includes several other provisions suggested or supported by the Board, including useful clarifications of the ability of insured banks to acquire savings associations in interstate merger transactions and of the authority of the federal banking agencies to maintain the confidentiality of supervisory information obtained from foreign supervisory authorities. The Board would be pleased to work with the Subcommittee, the full Committee, and their staffs as you seek to develop and advance meaningful regulatory relief legislation that is consistent with the nation's public policy objectives.
Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. The Financial Stability Forum meeting At the International Monetary and Financial Committee Meeting, Washington, D.C. September 24, 2005 The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) held its fourteenth meeting on 8-9 September 2005 in London. The issues discussed included: risks and vulnerabilities in the international financial system; the resilience of the financial system to shocks; lessons from past market liquidity crises; standards and codes, including the standard-setting process; accounting and auditing issues; and reinsurance. Vulnerabilities in the international financial system The FSF noted that economic and financial conditions in the last six months had remained generally benign, having weathered a number of challenges. However, members pointed to the potential impact of higher oil and gas prices on near term prospects for growth and inflation, a factor exacerbated by Hurricane Katrina. Members also pointed to a number of continuing developments that could over time lead to strains in financial markets. These included low levels of risk premia and long-term interest rates, the ongoing search for yield, increased exposures to complex and illiquid products, rising household sector indebtedness, and persistent and growing external and fiscal imbalances. Considering the potential challenges these developments imply, many markets may perhaps be underpricing risks going forward. Events or policy mistakes that heighten perception of risks could significantly alter current conditions. In this regard, a resurgence in inflation could alter expectations about the path of short-term interest rates. Signs that higher oil prices are weakening growth, along with the maturing of the credit cycle, could alter perceptions about credit quality and widen credit spreads. Finally, rising oil prices may be troublesome for some emerging market economies. In light of these developments, the FSF noted the importance of policymakers, financial supervisors and market participants taking an appropriately medium-term view of risks and paying particular attention to ensuring the adequacy of market discipline, credit and operational standards and levels of provisioning. The FSF considered the resilience of the financial system to shocks, including the risk management capabilities and loss absorption capacity of financial institutions. Drawing on recent work undertaken by a number of national regulators, the FSF noted that there have been significant advances in risk management practices at financial institutions and strengthening of market infrastructure in recent years. Nevertheless, structural changes in markets, including growing product complexity and the entry of new participants, as well as the important role of large and complex institutions, highlighted the need for continuing improvements in both areas. In this context, members also welcomed the report by the private sector Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group II and strongly endorsed its call for all market participants to review and strengthen their practices in light of the report's recommendations. Members will continue to assess the systemic implications of the rapid growth of complex products and the hedge fund industry. The FSF will discuss these various issues again at its next meeting. Members discussed lessons from past market liquidity crises, with an eye towards steps that could be taken to improve the prevention of future crises and preparedness to respond to them. As part of this discussion, they considered whether gaps existed in processes for timely international information-sharing among authorities at times of crisis. Events this year in the credit derivatives markets have emphasized the need for market participants to stress-test their risk management models effectively for disruptions to market liquidity, in particular with regard to complex products. In this regard, members welcomed the continuing work by the Joint Forum in reviewing the funding liquidity risk management practices in financial institutions. Standards and codes relevant to strengthening financial systems The FSF discussed progress in the implementation of standards and codes. The discussion benefited from the recent reviews conducted by the IMF and World Bank Executive Boards as well as a roundtable discussion jointly organized by the FSF, IMF and World Bank earlier this year. The FSF noted that the 12 key international standards identified in 2000 remained the most important for strengthening financial systems. Members welcomed the large number of national assessments of observance of standards and codes that the IMF and World Bank had completed. Members pointed to steps toward implementation that the initiative had already encouraged, and emphasized the importance of fostering stronger commitment by domestic authorities, providing incentives for implementation, and mobilizing resources for assessments and technical assistance. Going forward, the FSF noted the need to prioritize resources and to focus on effective on-the-ground implementation. The FSF encouraged relevant bodies to reflect on the issue of how to prioritise efforts in support of effective standards implementation, including the prioritisation of principles within and across standards. The FSF also noted the need for further guidance for assessing the adequacy of enforcement and oversight of auditing and accounting practices at the national level, and welcomed the intention of the World Bank to convene a meeting of interested parties to consider how best to generate a consensus in this area. The FSF noted that the greater emphasis now given to international standards has carried with it greater interest in, and closer scrutiny of, the arrangements for setting those standards. FSF members therefore encouraged standard setting bodies to maintain progress in strengthening the transparency, governance and robustness of their standard setting processes. Members also encouraged standard setting bodies to give priority to developing standards that address the most pressing risks and with an appropriate regard for the potential costs and benefits of implementing new standards. The FSF will discuss at its next meeting work by the standard setting bodies to establish and implement best practices in their processes. Accounting and auditing The FSF welcomed the progress recently made by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and financial regulators to resolve some of the issues that had stood in the way of agreement on an international standard for financial instruments. Progress continues to be made by the IASB and national accounting standard setting bodies towards internationally convergent accounting standards. New projects are underway revisiting conceptual frameworks for financial accounting and reporting and developing a new financial instruments standard. In this regard, the FSF noted the important role that financial accounting and reporting standards play in safeguarding financial stability and the importance of dialogue on fundamental conceptual issues between accounting standard setters and stakeholders, especially financial supervisors. The FSF will continue to review the financial stability aspects of the development of accounting standards, while respecting the independence of the standard setters. The Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB), established in February 2005 to oversee the International Federation of Accountants' standard-setting activities relating to auditing and assurance practices and member body compliance programs, has met several times, and the European Commission's acceptance of observer status is welcome. The FSF will continue to support the activities of the PIOB and to encourage coordination between national auditor oversight bodies. Other issues The FSF also discussed work in a number of other areas, including by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors to develop supervisory guidance on finite risk reinsurance; the Joint Forum's ongoing development of a set of high-level business continuity principles for financial authorities and financial industry participants; and ongoing work by the IMF, IOSCO and other bodies to promote improvements in offshore financial centers. The FSF will continue to take a close interest in these subjects. In May 2005, the FSF further expanded its regional outreach by holding its first African regional meeting. Participants had a rich and frank exchange of views and regional participants valued the dialogue. Recognizing the imperatives of poverty alleviation and the pursuit of growth in the region, there was overwhelming agreement that the objectives of financial stability and economic development are inextricably interlinked. The FSF will hold a Latin American regional meeting in November 2005.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Economic flexibility To the National Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting, Chicago, Illinois (via satellite) September 27, 2005 Today I should like to reflect on some of the ways in which economic policy both affects and is affected by the increasing flexibility of the U.S. economy. For this country's first century and a half, government was only peripherally engaged in what we currently term the management of aggregate demand. Any endeavor to alter the path of private economic activity through active intervention would have been deemed inappropriate and, more important, unnecessary. In one of the more notable coincidences of history, our Declaration of Independence was signed the same year in which Adam Smith published his Wealth of Nations . Smith's prescription of letting markets prevail with minimal governmental interference became the guiding philosophy of American leadership for much of our history. With a masterful insight into the workings of the free-market institutions that were then emerging, Smith postulated an "invisible hand" in which competitive behavior drove an economy's resources toward their fullest and most efficient use. Economic growth and prosperity, he argued, would emerge if governments stood aside and allowed markets to work. Indeed, within a very few decades, free-market capitalism became the prevailing stance of most governments' economic policy, even if it was often implemented imperfectly. This framework withstood the conceptual onslaughts of Robert Owen's utopians, Karl Marx's communists and later, the Fabian socialists. The free-market paradigm came under more-vigorous attack after the collapse of the world's major economies in the 1930s. As the global depression deepened, the seeming failure of competitive markets to restore full employment perplexed economists until John Maynard Keynes offered an explanation that was to influence policy practitioners for generations to come. He argued that, contrary to the tenets of Smith and his followers, market systems did not always converge to full employment. They often appeared to settle at an equilibrium in which significant segments of the workforce were unable to find jobs. In the place of Smith's laissez-faire approach arose the view that government action was required to restore full employment and to rectify what were seen as other deficiencies of market-driven outcomes. A tidal wave of regulation soon swept over much of the American business community. Labor relations, securities markets, banking, agricultural pricing, and many other segments of the U.S. economy became subject to the oversight of government. The apparent success of the economy during World War II, which operated at full employment in contrast to the earlier frightening developments during the Depression years, led to a considerable reluctance to fully dismantle wartime regulations when the hostilities came to an end. However, cracks in the facade of government economic management appeared early in the post-World War II years, and those cracks continued to widen as time passed. At the macro level, the system of wage and price controls imposed in the 1970s to deal with the problem of inflation proved unworkable and ineffective. And at the micro level, heavy regulation of many industries was increasingly seen as impeding efficiency and competitiveness. By the early 1980s, the long-prevalent notion that the centrally planned economy of the Soviet Union was catching up with the West had begun to be discredited, though it was not fully discarded until the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 exposed the economic ruin behind the Iron Curtain. Starting in the 1970s, U.S. presidents, supported by bipartisan majorities in the Congress, responded to the growing recognition of the distortions created by regulation, by deregulating large segments of the transportation, communications, energy, and financial services industries. The stated purpose of this deregulation was to enhance competition, which had come to be seen as a significant spur to productivity growth and elevated standards of living. Assisting in the dismantling of economic restraints was the persistent, albeit slow, lowering of barriers to cross-border trade and finance. As a consequence, the United States, then widely seen as a once-great economic power that had lost its way, gradually moved back to the forefront of what Joseph Schumpeter, the renowned Harvard professor, had called "creative destruction"--the continual scrapping of old technologies to make way for the innovative. In that paradigm, standards of living rise because depreciation and other cash flows of industries employing older, increasingly obsolescent technologies are marshaled, along with new savings, to finance the production of capital assets that almost always embody cutting-edge technologies. Workers, of necessity, migrate with the capital. Through this process, wealth is created, incremental step by incremental step, as high levels of productivity associated with innovative technologies displace less-efficient productive capacity. The model presupposes the continuous churning of a flexible competitive economy in which the new displaces the old. As the 1980s progressed, the success of that strategy confirmed the earlier views that a loosening of regulatory restraint on business would improve the flexibility of our economy. No specific program encompassed and coordinated initiatives to enhance flexibility, but there was a growing recognition that a market economy could best withstand and recover from shocks when provided maximum flexibility. Beyond deregulation, innovative technologies, especially information technologies, have contributed critically to enhanced flexibility. A quarter-century ago, for example, companies often required weeks to discover the emergence of inventory imbalances, allowing production to continue to exacerbate the excess. Excessive stockbuilding, in turn, necessitated a deeper decline in output than would have been necessary had the knowledge of the status of inventories been fully current. The advent of innovative information technologies significantly shortened the reporting lag, enabling flexible real-time responses to emerging imbalances. Deregulation and the newer information technologies have joined, in the United States and elsewhere, to advance flexibility in the financial sector. Financial stability may turn out to have been the most important contributor to the evident significant gains in economic stability over the past two decades. Historically, banks have been at the forefront of financial intermediation, in part because their ability to leverage offers an efficient source of funding. But in periods of severe financial stress, such leverage too often brought down banking institutions and, in some cases, precipitated financial crises that led to recession or worse. But recent regulatory reform, coupled with innovative technologies, has stimulated the development of financial products, such as asset-backed securities, collateral loan obligations, and credit default swaps, that facilitate the dispersion of risk. Conceptual advances in pricing options and other complex financial products, along with improvements in computer and telecommunications technologies, have significantly lowered the costs of, and expanded the opportunities for, hedging risks that were not readily deflected in earlier decades. The new instruments of risk dispersal have enabled the largest and most sophisticated banks, in their credit-granting role, to divest themselves of much credit risk by passing it to institutions with far less leverage. Insurance companies, especially those in reinsurance, pension funds, and hedge funds continue to be willing, at a price, to supply credit protection. These increasingly complex financial instruments have contributed to the development of a far more flexible, efficient, and hence resilient financial system than the one that existed just a quarter-century ago. After the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000, unlike previous periods following large financial shocks, no major financial institution defaulted, and the economy held up far better than many had anticipated. If we have attained a degree of flexibility that can mitigate most significant shocks--a proposition as yet not fully tested--the performance of the economy will be improved and the job of macroeconomic policymakers will be made much simpler. Governments today, although still far more activist than in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, are rediscovering the benefits of competition and the resilience to economic shocks that it fosters. We are also beginning to recognize an international version of Smith's invisible hand in the globalization of economic forces. Whether by intention or by happenstance, many, if not most, governments in recent decades have been relying more and more on the forces of the marketplace and reducing their intervention in market outcomes. We appear to be revisiting Adam Smith's notion that the more flexible an economy, the greater its ability to self-correct after inevitable, often unanticipated disturbances. That greater tendency toward self-correction has made the cyclical stability of the economy less dependent on the actions of macroeconomic policymakers, whose responses often have come too late or have been misguided. It is important to remember that most adjustment of a market imbalance is well under way before the imbalance becomes widely identified as a problem. Individual prices, exchange rates, and interest rates, adjust incrementally in real time to restore balance. In contrast, administrative or policy actions that await clear evidence of imbalance are of necessity late. Being able to rely on markets to do the heavy lifting of adjustment is an exceptionally valuable policy asset. The impressive performance of the U.S. economy over the past couple of decades, despite shocks that in the past would have surely produced marked economic contraction, offers the clearest evidence of the benefits of increased market flexibility. We weathered a decline on October 19, 1987, of a fifth of the market value of U.S. equities with little evidence of subsequent macroeconomic stress--an episode that hinted at a change in adjustment dynamics. The credit crunch of the early 1990s and the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000 were absorbed with the shallowest recessions in the post-World War II period. And the economic fallout from the tragic events of September 11, 2001, was moderated by market forces, with severe economic weakness evident for only a few weeks. Most recently, the flexibility of our market-driven economy has allowed us, thus far, to weather reasonably well the steep rise in spot and futures prices for oil and natural gas that we have experienced over the past two years. The consequence has been a far more stable economy. * * * In perhaps what must be the greatest irony of economic policymaking, success at stabilization carries its own risks. Monetary policy--in fact, all economic policy--to the extent that it is successful over a prolonged period, will reduce economic variability and, hence, perceived credit risk and interest rate term premiums. A decline in perceived risk is often self-reinforcing in that it encourages presumptions of prolonged stability and thus a willingness to reach over an ever-more-extended time period. But, because people are inherently risk averse, risk premiums cannot decline indefinitely. Whatever the reason for narrowing credit spreads, and they differ from episode to episode, history cautions that extended periods of low concern about credit risk have invariably been followed by reversal, with an attendant fall in the prices of risky assets. Such developments apparently reflect not only market dynamics but also the all-too-evident alternating and infectious bouts of human euphoria and distress and the instability they engender. Therefore, because it is difficult to suppress growing market exuberance when the economic environment is perceived as more stable, a highly flexible system needs to be in place to rebalance an economy in which psychology and asset prices could change rapidly. Indeed, as I have pointed out in the past, policies to enhance economic flexibility need to be as integral a part of economic policy as are monetary and fiscal initiatives. Relying on policymakers to perceive when speculative asset bubbles have developed and then to implement timely policies to address successfully these misalignments in asset prices is simply not realistic. As the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) transcripts of the mid-1990s duly note, we at the Fed were uncomfortable with a stock market that appeared as early as 1996 to disconnect from its moorings. Yet the significant monetary tightening of 1994 did not prevent what must by then have been the beginnings of the bubble of the 1990s. And equity prices continued to rise during the tightening of policy between mid-1999 and May 2000. Indeed, the equity market's ability to withstand periods of tightening arguably reinforced the bull market's momentum. The FOMC knew that tools were available to choke off the stock market boom, but those tools would only have been effective if they undermined market participants' confidence in future stability. Market participants, however, read the resilience of the economy and stock prices in the face of monetary tightening as an indication of undiscounted market strength. By the late 1990s, it appeared to us that very aggressive action would have been required to counteract the euphoria that developed in the wake of extraordinary gains in productivity growth spawned by technological change. In short, we would have needed to risk precipitating a significant recession, with unknown consequences. The alternative was to wait for the eventual exhaustion of the forces of boom. We concluded that the latter course was by far the safer. Whether that judgment continues to hold up through time has yet to be determined. * * * Flexibility is most readily achieved by fostering an environment of maximum competition. A key element in creating this environment is flexible labor markets. Many working people equate labor market flexibility with job insecurity. Despite that perception, flexible labor policies appear to promote job creation. An increased capacity of management to discharge workers without excessive cost, for example, apparently increases companies' willingness to hire without fear of unremediable mistakes. The net effect, to the surprise of most, has been what appears to be a decline in the structural unemployment rate in the United States. Protectionism in all its guises, both domestic and international, does not contribute to the welfare of American workers. At best, it is a short-term fix at a cost of lower standards of living for the nation as a whole. We need increased education and training for those displaced by creative destruction, not a stifling of competition. Moving forward, I trust that we have learned durable lessons about the benefits of fostering and preserving a flexible economy. That flexibility has been the product of the economic dynamism of our workers and firms that was unleashed, in part, by the efforts of policymakers to remove rigidities and promote competition. Although the business cycle has not disappeared, flexibility has made the economy more resilient to shocks and more stable overall during the past couple of decades. To be sure, that stability has created some new challenges for policymakers. But more fundamentally, an environment of greater economic stability has been key to the impressive growth in the standards of living and economic welfare so evident in the United States.
Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency For Immediate Release September 28, 2005 The federal banking agencies today announced the issuance of orders granting emergency relief to bank transfer agents affected by Hurricane Katrina. The orders cover national banks, state member banks, state nonmember banks, bank holding companies, and bank subsidiaries. The relief applies retroactively for the period beginning August 29, 2005 through October 17, 2005. Transfer agents maintain records related to the issuance and transfer of securities and provide operational assistance in the sale and transfer of ownership of securities. These agents also may disburse dividends and send corporate information, including proxies, to holders of securities. The storm and its aftermath have resulted in a lack of communications, facilities, and available staff, that could hamper the efforts of transfer agents to access securities, records, and funds, and to process securities transactions. To address compliance issues caused by Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, the orders conditionally exempt banks, bank holding companies, and bank subsidiaries acting as transfer agents from compliance with Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These orders, which are being issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, complement an order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 15, 2005, that exempts transfer agents under the SEC's jurisdiction from the requirements of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Any transfer agents or other persons requiring additional assistance are encouraged to contact staff at the agencies for individual relief or interpretive guidance.

Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. U.S. currency At the unveiling of the new $10 note design, New York, New York September 28, 2005 Thank you, Treasurer Cabral. I am very pleased to join Secretary Snow in this unveiling of the newly designed $10 note. The note is beautifully designed and includes important anti-counterfeiting features. It is certainly fitting that the unveiling of the new $10 note take place in New York Harbor. Alexander Hamilton immigrated to New York in 1772 from Nevis, British West Indies, to be educated at King's College--now Columbia University--and pursue a career. However, at that time arriving in this harbor was quite different. The glow of Lady Liberty's torch was not here to greet immigrants until 1886 and Ellis Island was not established as an immigrant point of entry to the United States until 1892. Hamilton was one of the authors of the Federalist Papers, which were instrumental in persuading the states to ratify the U.S. Constitution. As we will see shortly, this important contribution is recognized in the design of the new note. Hamilton is also considered one of the most influential founding fathers because he was the primary architect of the financial and economic infrastructure of the federal government that we know today. In particular, he was the advocate for a central bank and, as the first Secretary of the Treasury, established the First Bank of the United States, in 1791. Hamilton believed that the roles of the national bank would be to make loans, handle government funds, issue financial notes, and provide a national currency. He said, "The tendency of a national bank is to increase public and private credit. The former gives power to the state, for the protection of its rights and interests, and the latter facilitates and extends the operations of commerce among individuals. Industry is increased, commodities are multiplied, agriculture and manufacturers flourish, and herein consists the true wealth and prosperity of a state." The first issuance of paper money by the federal government was authorized by Congress in 1861. Prior to that time, in what is referred to as the free banking era, state bank notes were the chief form of paper currency. Because the currency did not have a uniform design and there was no central control over currency issuance, an estimated one-third of all currency in circulation at that time may have been counterfeit. Since 1861 the U.S. government has worked continuously to instill confidence in, and maintain the integrity of, our currency. In 1863, Congress passed the National Banking Act which regulated the issuance of notes by national banks. The act also imposed a tax on state-chartered bank notes, a move that essentially eliminated these notes from circulation. Two years later, Congress established the Secret Service to guard against counterfeiting. In 1913, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act, which created the Federal Reserve as the nation's central bank, with authority to issue U.S. currency. At that time, the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury assumed control of the issuance and design of U.S. currency. Since then, the Fed and the Treasury have worked collaboratively to fulfill this joint responsibility. In its role as issuing authority, the Federal Reserve has an obligation to protect the integrity and stability of Federal Reserve notes. The Federal Reserve accomplishes this objective, in part, by working with the Treasury and its Bureau of Engraving and Printing, as well as the Secret Service, to develop design concepts for currency that the Secretary of the Treasury ultimately approves. The newly designed $10 note is a product of this close and ongoing cooperation. With respect to fighting counterfeiting, however, the job is never finished. In an environment of rapidly changing technology, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the Secret Service must remain alert to emerging threats to U.S currency and must continue to seek designs for the currency that will address tomorrow's risks. Until the mid-1980s, nearly all U.S. currency circulated only domestically--and it totaled a small fraction of the amount that circulates today. In just the past twenty years, the amount of U.S. currency in circulation has grown more than 300 percent, to about $730 billion, and it is now held widely outside the country. As a global currency, Federal Reserve notes must continue to reflect the strength and stability of our economy. A sound currency, which this new $10 note will help foster, is a critical element in the strength of our economy. Our hope is a smooth transition for the newly designed currency into daily cash transactions. Keep in mind that you can use both the newly designed $10 note and all other designs in everyday transactions because the Federal Reserve has never recalled any of the previously released U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve, along with the other agencies represented here today, is committed to maintaining confidence in and the integrity of our currency. As a nation, we back up that commitment with a first-rate enforcement team. It's my pleasure now to introduce a key member of that team--Ralph Basham, the Director of the U.S. Secret Service.

Remarks by Governor Donald L. Kohn At the Quantitative Evidence on Price Determination Conference, Washington, D.C. September 29, 2005 Inflation Modeling: A Policymakers Perspective An occasion like this one is a natural opportunity to reflect on how policymakers' understanding of the inflation process has progressed over time. Clearly we have come a long way since the early 1970s. Most important, we have absorbed the central lesson of Milton Friedman's 1968 address to the American Economic Association--that any tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is only temporary because of the dynamic nature of expectations. We have also taken on board the practical application of this lesson that monetary policy must be vigilant about anchoring inflation expectations. Operationally, maintaining price stability requires abiding by the Taylor principle of raising nominal interest rates more than one for one in response to movements in inflation, especially those movements perceived as persistent. It also requires that policy tighten or ease systematically to bring aggregate demand in line with the economy's productive potential, not only because output stabilization is a policy objective in its own right but also because such actions help to head off undesirable changes in inflation down the road. These basic precepts, embraced by central bankers everywhere, have almost certainly contributed to the improved performance of inflation over the past decade or two, and this better price performance probably has helped to damp business cycles. Of course, economists and policymakers still have a great deal to learn about the interactions of monetary policy, the real economy, and inflation. But as the conference papers illustrate, we are making progress. Still, when it comes to inflation modeling and policymaking, as my grade school report cards used to say: There is room for improvement. Specifically, I wonder whether current inflation research adequately addresses the questions that bedevil me as a policymaker. Tonight I cannot resist the opportunity presented by having access to a captive group of researchers to share these concerns with you, with the intention of providing some constructive suggestions for future work. What properties am I looking for in a model of inflation and the economy overall? First, the model should provide a coherent analytical framework that the policymaker can use to interpret incoming data and to choose a proper policy response. Second, the model should provide an accurate empirical description of the economy as it relates to both forecasting and the influence of policy on the outlook. My experience on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as a consumer of model-based forecasts and analysis suggests that work remains to be done on both fronts--and, in particular, on meeting both objectives with the same model. As regards the first property, the conceptual--albeit informal--framework that many policymakers like to use is largely "bottom up" and features costs and expectations. It starts with wages and the prices of other inputs into production, and after taking into account productivity, it sees prices set as a markup over unit costs. Wage determination plays a key role in this framework and is influenced by such factors as inflation expectations, productivity, and labor market slack; the markup, too, is important because it varies over time depending on changes in the competitive environment, expected future costs, and other factors. At first glance, the empirical structural models currently favored in academic research and discussed at this conference--such as the New Keynesian Phillips curve--appear to conform to the informal policymaker model: Expectations formation is dealt with formally, and price inflation, at least in some empirical representations, is directly tied to measures of unit labor costs. On closer inspection, however, one sees that the specifications of these models typically ignore important factors bearing on the inflation outlook. One category of neglected factors is price shocks--changes in the levels of key inputs, such as energy or imports. Policymakers spend a great deal of time discussing the circumstances under which such shocks can lead to persistent changes in the rate of inflation. Yet, despite their historical importance for aggregate inflation, energy prices, for example, are controlled for in only one of the structural models discussed at this conference. And this importance is not necessarily a concern of the past: Prices for oil and natural gas have soared since 2003, directly boosting the energy component of the consumer price index as well as raising the production costs, and ultimately to at least some degree the prices, of non-energy goods and services. As a policymaker, I can assure you that any model of inflation that did not take account of these effects, and how they might or might not affect ongoing rates of inflation, would have been of little practical use to the FOMC over the past few years. Reduced-form regressions suggest that the response of core inflation to energy prices has diminished over the past twenty years. Does this smaller response reflect a change in the expectations formation process that has come about because the public perceives that inflation will remain low, perhaps because the monetary authority is now seen to be more vigilant in reacting to price pressures? Or does it reflect a reduction, from the late 1970s until a couple of years ago, in the persistence of energy price movements that has prompted firms to be less worried about passing temporary cost increases onto customers? Determining which of these explanations is most important is a critical issue for monetary policy right now, when futures markets indicate that people expect the current elevated price of energy to persist. But economists are not well positioned to provide much evidence on this issue, given the relative paucity of empirical work on expectations formation. Certainly the standard approach used to estimate structural models is not that helpful because it simply assumes an answer--rational expectations, typically accompanied by full central bank credibility. But how well does this assumption match reality? True, financial market participants do seem to respond to incoming economic data in a generally forward-looking and logical manner, but we also observe asset price levels, volatility, and implied risk premiums that are sometimes difficult to understand. And I doubt that any central bank has achieved perfect credibility in the markets. Moreover, it is not obvious that investors' expectations always line up with those of households and firms, the ones that should matter for wage and price setting. We really know very little about the precise manner in which these agents form their beliefs about the future, in part because of a lack of comprehensive data on expectations. Nonetheless, economists are certainly grappling with this issue, as evidenced by the growing interest of late in models that incorporate rational inattention, sticky information, learning, and imperfect credibility. Behavioral economics, with its focus on how people perceive and act on information in making decisions, may also provide some insights into the modeling of expectations. If plausible departures from rational expectations and full credibility are empirically verified, then our structural models need to take that into account. A new set of questions would then be on the table in policy analysis. Among other questions that could be addressed would be how policy actions (as opposed to inflation outcomes) influence expectations and how sensitive Federal Reserve credibility is to short-run departures from low inflation. Such knowledge would be extremely useful in current circumstances in gauging the scope for monetary policy to offset the short-run output effects of higher energy prices without triggering adverse longer-run inflation consequences. Another area needing further attention is wage setting. My impression, reinforced by the papers at this conference, is that many of the newer empirical structural models of price inflation posit a central role for real marginal cost but seem to have little to say about its determination or that of its main component, labor compensation. This neglect may reflect the difficulty of specifying the aggregate dynamics of an atomistic labor market characterized by pronounced heterogeneity, significant informational imperfections, and important adjustment costs. By comparison, these complications seem less severe in product markets, which for the most part are more transparent and easier to analyze. Moreover, as I will discuss in a minute, empirical work on wage determination may be especially hindered by issues of data quality. Let me give an example of why I think it is important to have a firm grasp of how wages are set. Many economists, both inside and outside the Federal Reserve, think that the acceleration in labor productivity in the mid-1990s subsequently helped to restrain the rate of price inflation. This conclusion requires that the adjustment of nominal wages to the higher trend in productivity was slow, an outcome that put downward pressure on unit labor costs and, hence, on prices. Its consistency with the data notwithstanding, I would be more comfortable with this hypothesis if it were supported by a structural model of wage determination that was firmly grounded in theory and microevidence. As noted earlier, the design of sound structural models is only a start. As a policymaker, I need those models to provide accurate forecasts and empirically well-grounded policy analysis. The analysis contained in the papers by Rudd and Whelan, Kiley, and Laforte are valuable first steps in comparing the empirical properties of alternative structural and reduced-form models. Nonstructural specifications, despite their shortcomings with regard to the desirable model properties I noted earlier, do have an important role to play in policymaking--in particular, forecasting. Structural models do not as yet fully encompass the information used by reduced-form specifications, and the historical relationships summarized in these latter models have often proven to be more useful guides to future inflation developments. Such models often include energy- and import-price terms along with measures of slack and expectations. They inform the staff's judgmental inflation forecast as well as my own thinking about the outlook. Data measurement issues add to the challenge of developing better empirical models for policy work. One important example concerns hourly labor compensation. The measure reported in the national accounts is often revised significantly, displays substantial volatility from quarter to quarter, and has components that may not coincide with the labor costs relevant to business pricing decisions. These deficiencies, among others, also affect published estimates of labor's share in the nonfarm business sector--the usual measure of real marginal cost used in empirical work. Other measures of labor compensation, such as the employment cost index, have their own particular deficiencies and can yield conflicting signals of trends in labor costs. An unpleasant implication of these various data problems is that they may make difficult the development of structural models incorporating wage behavior that are reliable enough for policy analysis, despite their attractiveness to policymakers like me. Of course, measurement issues do not afflict only models that exploit data on labor compensation. Many inflation models in use, both structural and reduced-form, include some measure of resource utilization as a determinant of price inflation, such as the gap between the unemployment rate and the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). And as we know, the latter cannot be directly observed. Although economists have made some progress in estimating potential output, policymakers should be cautious about responding aggressively to estimated movements in economic slack. Paradoxically, the ability to confirm our estimates of output relative to potential in a timely way may have been diminished by the success of the Federal Reserve and other central banks in achieving low and stable inflation. Although controversial, some evidence from reduced-form price equations suggests that inflation has become less sensitive to economic slack in recent years, possibly as a consequence of more firmly anchored inflation expectations. Consistent with this evidence, the Board staff's rule-of-thumb estimate of the sacrifice ratio rose from around 2 or 3 in the mid-1980s to around 4 currently. Imbalances between demand and potential supply would thus now be slow to show through convincingly to inflation, but when they do, they may be costly to correct. The various specification and empirical issues that I have raised tonight are major challenges, and based on our experience using the FRB/US model here at the Board, they may prove quite difficult to overcome. FRB/US has many of the desirable attributes mentioned earlier. In particular, its wage and price equations are variants of the New Keynesian Phillips curve, with core specifications that are derived from cost minimization and equations that are estimated assuming rational expectations. However, in incorporating the effects of such factors as energy costs, import prices, and productivity into the model's wage-price block, the staff found it necessary to sacrifice some theoretical niceties in order to get close to the predictive accuracy provided by reduced-form models. Perhaps future researchers will be able to resolve this tension in some clever way, but some tradeoff between purity of design and forecasting accuracy probably will always be unavoidable. In addition, the staff's experience with FRB/US illustrates some of the problems inherent in using real-time wage data. Although the policy analyses generated using the model have been quite useful from my perspective, and the model has compiled a reasonable forecasting record overall, the accuracy of its price inflation forecasts has suffered from their sensitivity to current readings on labor's share. These remarks have presented a long list of "helpful" suggestions for future research. You might ask: Does successful monetary policymaking really require all this additional knowledge? Do not central banks already have what they need to do a good job? If policymakers continue to recognize the critical role of long-term price stability, keep a close eye on inflation expectations, and adhere to the Taylor principle, would not things be OK, as they have been for much of the past twenty years? This view strikes me as too complacent. Even if it is true that things tend to turn out OK on average under the present state of knowledge, macroeconomic performance could be better yet if policymakers were able to take advantage of a fuller understanding of the dynamics of the economy. And we would do well to be cautious about attributing the good macroeconomic performance entirely to good monetary policy. Decomposing the sources of the Great Moderation is a difficult business, and a number of researchers interpret the evidence as suggesting that monetary policy was not the most important factor. Luck as well as structural changes in the economy may have had a lot to do with the current low level and apparent stability of U.S. inflation. If so, and if our luck turns and we experience a series of adverse shocks, our ability to formulate policies that deliver sound performance may depend upon a much better understanding of the inflation process and of expectations formation.

The sacrifice ratio is defined as the cumulative amount of unemployment greater than the NAIRU (in percentage points) required to reduce the inflation rate by 1 percentage point, all else being equal.
Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For immediate release September 30, 2005 Banking Agencies Announce Revised Plan for Implementation of Basel II Framework The four Federal banking agencies (the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision) today announced their revised plans for the U.S. implementation of the "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework," otherwise known as Basel II. The agencies previously announced on April 29, 2005 that they were delaying issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR), pending additional analysis of the quantitative impact study (QIS4) submissions. The agencies intend to move forward with an NPR for domestic implementation of Basel II, but plan to introduce additional prudential safeguards in the NPR to address concerns identified in the analysis of the results of the QIS4 conducted with the industry. The agencies expect that the U.S. Basel II proposal will be available in the first quarter of 2006. The agencies' Basel II implementation plan includes the following elements: The agencies expect to propose a revised implementation timeline for Basel II. Under this revised timeline, the first opportunity for a U.S. banking institution to conduct a parallel run would be January 2008. In addition, U.S. institutions adopting the Basel II-based capital rules would be subject to a minimum three-year transition period during which the agencies would apply limits on the amount by which each institution's risk-based capital could decline with the application of Basel II. These limits would be implemented through floors that are intended to be simpler in design and more conservative in effect than those set forth in Basel II. For institutions that plan to implement the Basel II framework at the earliest possible implementation date, the following timetable and transitional arrangements would be proposed in the NPR: Year Transitional Arrangements 2008 Parallel Run 2009 95% floor 2010 90% floor 2011 85% floor An institution's primary Federal supervisor would assess that institution's readiness to operate under the Basel II-based capital rules consistent with the above schedule. As part of this assessment, the primary Federal supervisor will make a decision on the termination of the floors after 2011 on an institution-by-institution basis. Using information received during the U.S. Basel II implementation process (including the transition period), the agencies will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the Basel II-based capital rules. The agencies anticipate that there will be further revisions to the U.S. Basel II-based capital rules prior to the termination of the floors. The agencies will retain both the existing Prompt Corrective Action and leverage capital requirements in the proposed domestic implementation of Basel II. The agencies expect to shortly publish for notice and comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on possible modifications to the risk-based capital rules for banks that do not become subject to Basel II-based capital rules. The revised transition schedule for the domestic implementation of the Basel II framework will permit industry consideration of and public comment on these two rulemaking initiatives along similar timeframes. 2008 Parallel Run 2009 95% floor 2010 90% floor 2011 85% floor Media Contacts: Federal Reserve Dave Skidmore 202-452-2955 FDIC David Barr 202-898-6634 OCC Kevin Mukri 202-874-5770 OTS Kevin Petrasic 202-906-6677
