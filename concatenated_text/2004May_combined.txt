Remarks by Governor Mark W. Olson At the 26th Conference of the American Council on Gift Annuities, Orlando, Florida May 5, 2004 The Federal Open Market Committee and the Formation of Monetary Policy Thank you very much for inviting me here this evening. When my longtime friend Lance Jacobson extended this invitation more than a year ago, I readily accepted. Several months later, the 2004 calendar of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings was released, and I discovered that this meeting would occur on the day following the Committee's May meeting. Because FOMC members observe a blackout on discussions of the economy for the week before and the week of the FOMC meetings, I prefer not to talk about current economic conditions. However, I can provide you with some insight into the way the FOMC functions and the impact of monetary policy on the U.S. and global economies. My former Federal Reserve colleague Laurence Meyer provided the blueprint for this presentation in a 1998 speech entitled "Come with Me to the FOMC ." That title, in turn, was borrowed from remarks given back in 1951. While my remarks are not identical in either style or substance, I have borrowed heavily from Larry's presentation, and you have the assurance that they have a long history. First, a comment or two on who we are. Nineteen policymakers participate in FOMC meetings, although at most only twelve vote at any one time. At times vacancies on the Board mean that the FOMC has fewer than twelve voting members. The Board has now operated at full strength for almost two years, after several years with two vacancies. Each of the Board members is appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Our Chairman, Alan Greenspan, has two designations: The President has appointed him both as a Board member and as Chairman. A Board member's term is fourteen years, and the Chairman has a term of four years. Though Alan Greenspan's chairmanship expires this June, his term as a Board member extends through January 2006. As you may know, President Bush announced last year that he intended to reappoint Mr. Greenspan as Chairman. The Board Vice Chairman is also appointed by the President for a four-year term. The current Vice Chairman, Roger Ferguson, was reappointed last fall. In addition to the Board of Governors, five of the twelve Reserve Bank presidents vote in any given year. The President of the New York Fed is a permanent voting member whereas the other Bank presidents vote every other or every third year. If you find this construct confusing, or unduly complex, perhaps a bit of background is in order. The Federal Reserve System is generically described as the central bank of the United States. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries there were two attempts to establish a central bank of the United States, and neither endured for more than twenty years--in contrast to most European nations, where central banks were well established by the nineteenth century. Though you may not be familiar with the history of our central bank, you may well remember learning about the debates on the concept of federalism by our nation's founders, when the forces favoring decentralization, led by Thomas Jefferson, fought the proponents of a more centralized government, led by Alexander Hamilton. The Jeffersonian forces largely prevailed. As a result, the United States lacked a strong central bank presence but had no authority even to grant national charters to commercial banks until the Abraham Lincoln Administration. All bank charters were originally granted by the states and, as a consequence, the United States at one time had more than 25,000 bank charters. Today, we have about 8,000 separate bank charters. By contrast, most other developed nations have fewer than 100 separately chartered banks. In the early part of the last century, a monetary panic stimulated the legislation leading to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. And consistent with our tradition of dispersed economic power, the new central bank of the United States was created with a significant grass roots component. As a result, twelve Federal Reserve Banks were created, owned by member banks in each District, headed by a Reserve Bank president, and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. To give you a sense of the dispersal of resources within the Federal Reserve, more than 22,000 employees work in the System, meaning both the Banks and the Board. Of that number, about 1,700 work for the Board in Washington, and the remaining 20,000-plus work in the twelve Banks. Of the 1,700 Washington employees, roughly 250 are Ph.D. economists, the majority of whom support the Board's monetary policy responsibilities. The FOMC has eight scheduled meetings each year, roughly every six weeks. Financial markets follow the FOMC's actions very carefully and examine each word in the statement released after each meeting. Today I would like to share with you my perspectives gleaned from thirty months on the Board and twenty FOMC meetings. I was most impressed at my first FOMC meeting in December 2001 by the extraordinary level of preparation by and for the FOMC members. Let me begin by describing the contributions of the twelve Bank presidents. Each of the twelve Banks is staffed with economists who monitor the economic conditions in their respective Districts. A summary of the regional analysis is compiled in what we call the Beige Book (because it has a beige cover) and released to the public about two weeks before the FOMC meeting. Today we are in Florida, which is part of the Atlanta Fed's District, so let me speculate on how developments in this area's economy may enter our deliberations. Jack Guynn, president of the Atlanta Fed, comes to the meeting prepared to discuss the outlook for the entire Sixth Federal Reserve District. With respect to this particular part of the District, Jack may discuss Florida's citrus crop, the relative health of the tourism industry, and trends in Florida real estate prices. Because Florida is also a gateway to Latin America, he may also discuss factors affecting trade with that part of the world. Similar preparations take place at each of the other eleven Banks. Though only five presidents vote at each meeting, all twelve prepare reports and participate fully in FOMC discussions. The president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank is accorded a special role on the FOMC. That person--currently Timothy Geithner--is always a voting member and is traditionally elected as Vice Chairman of the FOMC. This role is largely a reflection of the New York Fed's responsibility for implementing monetary policy decisions through its open market desk operations. Typically, after the approval of the minutes of the previous FOMC meeting, the first order of business is a report from the System Open Market Account (SOMA) Manager at the New York Fed. The Manager discusses market activity since the most recent FOMC meeting and may also report on any other domestic or international market activity that may reflect trends in the U.S. and world economies. The SOMA Manager's report is followed by reports by senior Board economists, including the directors of the Division of Research and Statistics and the Division of International Finance. Each report summarizes what we refer to as the Greenbook, which is prepared by a team of economists. The time between receipt of the Greenbook and the reports by the directors is a time of intense study and preparation by the FOMC members. Governors often schedule briefings from Fed economists besides conducting their own individual reviews. The materials typically arrive on our desks late Thursday or early Friday and our Board review of economic conditions occurs the following Monday morning. In our household, my family has learned that my time during the weekend before an FOMC meeting is often largely consumed in preparation for it. While the preparation for FOMC members is very intense, I would be remiss if I did not give full credit to the effort of the economists preparing the reports. Fed staff economists hold off their Greenbook preparation until the last possible minute and supplement it just before the meeting with the most up-to-date economic data releases and developments. The Federal Reserve Board has, over time, developed powerful econometric modeling tools to assist our understanding of the many interrelated economic forces. In large part because human behavior cannot be modeled, we cannot fully anticipate all the factors that can affect our economic policy, and no econometric model can predict perfectly. Therefore we often review alternative scenarios that may reflect different ways in which the economy may respond in a variety of situations. After the economists' reports, we turn to the presidents and governors. Typically the presidents report first on regional economic developments as well as on their independent views on the national economy. Not surprisingly, economists from the Banks and the Board largely agree, but occasionally discernable differences exist, particularly with respect to economic forecasts. The presidents' reports often include anecdotal updates from businesses or other sources to provide real-time information on regional economic activity. Following the presidents' presentations, the Fed governors provide their individual analyses. Our presentations focus largely on analysis of the current condition of the economy and, for the most part, do not contain monetary policy recommendations. After each of the FOMC members has spoken, the director of the Division of Monetary Affairs presents the Bluebook, with prospective policy options for the Committee's consideration. In my time on the FOMC, generally two or three options have been presented, each accompanied by a list of pros and cons. After the presentation of policy alternatives, FOMC members resume their discussion, focusing now on their policy preferences. In the twenty FOMC meetings in which I have participated, Chairman Greenspan's participation in the discussion until this point has been limited. I suspect that this fact might surprise most FOMC observers as Chairman Greenspan, like virtually all of his predecessors, is considered almost the personification of monetary policy. Yet before the Chairman offers his first substantive comments at these meetings, eighteen other participants, representing literally hundreds of hours of study and analysis, have provided their input. Considering the complexity of the U.S. economy and the implications of monetary policy on the world economy, the issue facing each FOMC member is deceptively simple. We establish a target interest rate for what is known as federal funds--or, more commonly, fed funds. Fed funds constitute an interbank arrangement that allows banks with surplus balances at their Federal Reserve Bank to loan those funds overnight to banks that temporarily need to borrow to meet their balance requirements. An individual bank's balances on their Federal Reserve accounts can vary significantly depending on the dollar amount of the checks cleared that day, the volume and sequence of wire transfers in and out of the bank's account, and changes in investment or lending at the bank. In the aggregate, fed funds are an important indicator of liquidity in the banking system and, by implication, the money supply. All fed funds loans are for a single day, and the interest rate is reestablished daily. Fed funds rates thus are an excellent barometer of both the price of money and the changes in the money supply. The Federal Reserve Act requires that monetary policy promote maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. Happily, in this instance, congressional intent is also sound monetary policy. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker once said, "No central bank can--or should, in my judgment--conduct policies for long that are out of keeping with basic, continuing objectives of the political system." When I was a young banker in the 1960s, many of my loan customer's decisions were affected at least in part by memories of the Great Depression. While depression fears were widespread, the ravages of high inflation elsewhere, such as post-World War I Europe, had not been experienced here. In fact, many people had a positive view of inflation as leading rising property values and were not convinced that inflation was inherently bad. Public policy decisions with inflationary implications--often expressed as funding both "guns and butter"--were broadly supported. Only after the high-inflation years of the late 1970s and early1980s, after the spending power of incomes had been seriously eroded, were the consequences of inflation fully understood. Part of the success in achieving consistent economic growth in the United States is due in significant part to broad public support for our mandated monetary policy objectives. FOMC monetary policy affects the money supply through the Open Market Desk at the New York Federal Reserve Bank. A team of young (I mean young--half my age or less), whip-smart men and women begin each workday by analyzing all the factors affecting the money supply. They then gauge the appropriate amount of buying or selling for the Fed's portfolio of government securities required to maintain our target rate. When more liquidity is required, the Domestic Trading Desk purchases securities. If tightening is in order, the Desk sells into the market, replacing idle balances with investment securities and thereby marginally reducing the liquidity in the banking system. Though these professionals are young, money market activity conducted by the New York Fed is an established discipline more than eighty years old. As a result, the team knows from experience how best to maintain the target rate. The daily determination to buy or sell is communicated to a group of pre-selected securities dealers known as primary dealers, which ensures a consistent and reliable group of market participants and a competitive bid process for these transactions. The buy or sell orders are communicated electronically to the primary dealers early each day, and when the bidding is opened shortly after 9:30 a.m., the day's transactions are completed within seconds. However, the FOMC members know that our decisions affect more than the money supply. Many other interest rates are indexed directly or indirectly to the fed funds rate. Further, FOMC decisions are viewed as an indication of the economy's underlying strength or weakness. In part, because of these broad implications, efforts have been made in recent years to improve our communication practices. The FOMC's current practice is to issue a news release after our regular meetings, about 2:15 p.m. (ET). The release currently has three parts. The first part states the fed funds target rate of interest; the second briefly explains and updates our analysis of current economic conditions. The third provides our assessment of the balance of risks with respect to the prospects for price stability and economic growth. The FOMC decision is communicated to the Domestic Trading Desk at the New York Fed, and the revised policy is then initiated and becomes the policy guideline for the next six or seven weeks. However, the FOMC can reconvene and reconsider its monetary policy stance at any time, at the call of the Chairman, as changes in the economy warrant. I said earlier that one of my first impressions of FOMC meetings related to the extraordinary level of preparation by both economists and members. Let me share two other impressions as well. At most FOMC meetings, the vote on the final FOMC target and the accompanying statement has been unanimous. This pattern raises an obvious question as to the extent to which votes contrary to the will of the Chairman--or the majority--are tolerated. Having spent several years on Capitol Hill where unanimous votes on major issues rarely occur, I am particularly conscious of the contrast. One reason many votes are unanimous is that there is no "loyal opposition" bloc within the Committee. The FOMC contains neither caucuses nor coalitions representing either political or philosophic differences. Second, and in stark contrast to other environments, there is a notable absence of posturing, which I define as an isolated or "throw away" vote to make a statement or to call attention to an individual cause. Yet there are clearly discernable differences in economic philosophy among FOMC members. Over the years, FOMC watchers have labeled some of the Committee members as either inflation-fighting hawks or growth-promoting doves based on previous voting patterns and public statements. In recent months, news articles have pointed out the different approaches to policy represented by Governors Ben Bernanke and Donald Kohn, the Board's two newest members. Governor Bernanke, a widely respected researcher and monetary policy textbook author, has advocated inflation targeting--that is, publicly identifying an acceptable range for inflation. Several other monetary authorities, including the Bank of England, have adopted this approach. Governor Kohn, a career Federal Reserve System economist with an equally stellar reputation in his field, disagrees, preferring that FOMC members establish monetary policy not with a predetermined range of acceptable inflation rates but by considering a broader range of economic factors. I find this relatively public debate to be both instructive and healthy. It provides evidence of the depth of understanding and analysis by FOMC members and supports the integrity of FOMC voting patterns when observers note that Ben and Don have recorded identical votes during their tenures. One other thought on the FOMC tendency for unanimous votes concerns the nature of Chairman Greenspan's leadership. The Chairman encourages forthright and thorough discussion. He seeks consensus among FOMC members, and the personal views he interjects into the discussion serve more as a beacon than a command. As a result, he achieves consensus through the quality of his leadership and the depth of his analysis. A final observation concerns the limitations of monetary policy. During the months between my nomination and swearing-in to the Board, I read numerous articles and talked with many monetary policy authorities. A common theme during that time of preparation concerned monetary policy's limitations. In his Come with Me to the FOMC article, Larry Meyer wrote eloquently on this very point. I will try to make the same point. The primary role of monetary policy is to achieve price stability. Inflation, as Milton Friedman famously said, is always a monetary phenomenon. To control the supply of money is also, in the long run, to control the rate of inflation. By contrast, monetary policy does not as directly influence employment or output. Therefore, much of the historic strength and resilience of the U.S. economy is only tangentially influenced by monetary policy. Obviously, output and employment benefit from the environment of price stability that monetary policy works to achieve. Monetary policy is also a blunt instrument. It does not, and cannot, target a particular segment of society or of the economy. FOMC members become very conscious of this fact as every part of the economic cycle seems to benefit some and penalize others. Overwhelmingly, however, monetary policy aimed at achieving price stability and maximum sustainable employment over time provides the best environment for job creation and improving living standards. It has been my privilege to associate with the men and women who constitute the Federal Open Market Committee. Without exception, it is a dedicated, committed, and talented group that fully understands both the responsibilities and the limitations of making monetary policy for the United States. I hope this presentation has provided some insight into how we carry out our responsibilities. Footnotes , Laurence H. Meyer, the Gillis Lecture, Williamette University, Salem Oregon, April 2, 1998.

Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies To the Financial Services Institute 2004, Washington, D.C. May 6, 2004 Financial Innovation and Effective Risk Management Introduction Thank you for inviting me to speak at this very timely seminar on the evolution of the financial services industry. The industry has indeed evolved over the four-and-one-half years since passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act--and perhaps in many respects, it has evolved in directions different than some envisioned when the act was under consideration in the Congress. Today I would like to discuss the evolution of the industry and the development of innovative products, services, and activities, especially in the areas of complex structured finance transactions and credit risk transfer. I will then discuss the role of counsel in ensuring the effective risk management of these innovations through a robust enterprise-wide risk-management framework. Industry Evolution and Innovation The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act recognized the market reality that the limitations imposed by the Glass-Steagall Act in the 1930s and other statutory restrictions had been rendered nearly irrelevant by financial innovation, much of it outside the banking industry. Gramm-Leach-Bliley realigned the law to reflect the existing realities of the marketplace and to permit banks to do more efficiently what they were already doing in costly ways. The statute relaxed long-standing restrictions on affiliations among commercial banks, securities firms, and insurance companies; authorized the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury to designate additional financial holding company activities as "financial in nature" or "incidental to a financial activity;" and authorized the Federal Reserve Board to determine whether activities are "complementary to a financial activity." To avoid extending to these new activities the subsidy implicit in deposit insurance and in access to the Federal Reserve's discount window and payment system guarantees, the act requires that many of these activities be conducted through a legally separate bank holding company affiliate, provided also that the holding company meets the "well-managed" and "well-capitalized" criteria for designation as a financial holding company. When Gramm-Leach-Bliley became law in 1999, many predicted the rise of the financial conglomerate--an entity that would provide a full range of banking, securities, and insurance products and services to institutional and retail customers. However, this prediction has not been realized, and the pace of change has been relatively slow since 1999. The slow pace is, no doubt, partly a result of the economic slowdown and stock market decline from 2000 to last year. But I suspect that these factors do not explain fully why we have not seen the rise of the financial conglomerate. Indeed, I suggest that the benefits that might result from running a financial conglomerate are in fact much more difficult to realize than many may have thought. True, there are now in excess of 600 domestic financial holding companies. But most of these are relatively small. Roughly three-quarters of financial holding companies have assets of less than $10 billion. Fewer than one-third of all financial holding companies have reported engaging in newly authorized activities, and most of these have opted to engage in relatively well-understood and less-risky insurance agency activities. Thus, the activities of most banking organizations have not changed significantly since Gramm-Leach-Bliley. However, innovation in financial products and services has continued since Gramm-Leach-Bliley. Many of these innovations cross sector boundaries and involve banking, securities, and insurance firms. Today, I will talk about two of these innovations: complex structured finance transactions and credit risk transfer. Complex Structured Finance Transactions Innovation has occurred in the development of complex structured finance transactions, which have received quite a bit of negative press of late. While we are all too aware that recent events have unfortunately highlighted the ways in which complex structured transactions can be used for improper or even fraudulent purposes, these transactions, when designed and used appropriately, can play an important role in financing businesses and mitigating various forms of financial risks. Although deal structures vary, complex structured finance transactions generally have four common characteristics. First, they typically result in a final product that is nonstandard and is structured to meet a customer's specific financial objectives. Second, they often involve professionals from multiple disciplines and may involve significant fees. Third, they may be associated with the creation or use of one or more special-purpose entities designed to address the customer's economic, legal, tax, or accounting objectives or the use of a combination of cash and derivatives products. Fourth, and perhaps most important, they may expose the financial institution to elevated levels of market, credit, operations, legal, or reputational risk. Financial institutions may assume substantial risks when they engage in a complex structured finance transaction unless they have a full understanding of the economic substance and business purpose of the transaction. These risks are often difficult to quantify, but the result can be severe damage to the reputations of both the companies engaging in the transactions and their financial advisers--and, in turn, impaired public confidence in those institutions. These potential risks and the resulting damage are particularly severe when markets react through adverse changes in pricing for similarly structured transactions that are designed appropriately. Assessments of the appropriateness of a transaction for a client traditionally have required financial firms and advisers to determine if the transaction is consistent with the market sophistication, financial condition, and investment policies of the customer. Given recent events, it is appropriate to raise the bar for appropriateness assessments by taking into account the business purpose and economic substance of the transaction. When banking organizations provide advice on, arrange, or actively participate in complex structured finance transactions, they may assume legal and reputational risks if the end user enters into the transaction for improper purposes. Legal counsel to financial firms can help manage legal and reputational risk by taking an active role in the review of the customer's governance process for approving the transaction, of financial disclosures relating to the transaction, and of the customer's objectives for entering into the transaction. On the regulatory side, the Federal Reserve has been working with the other federal banking agencies and the Securities and Exchange Commission to develop interagency guidance on complex structured finance transactions. We believe it is important for all participants in complex structured finance transactions to understand the agencies' concerns and supervisory direction. Our goal is to highlight the "lessons learned" from recent events as well as what we believe on the basis of supervisory reviews and experience, to be sound practices in this area. As in other operational areas, strong internal controls and risk-management procedures can help institutions effectively manage the risks associated with complex structured finance transactions. Here are some of the steps that financial institutions, with the assistance of counsel and other advisers, should take to establish such controls and procedures: Ensure that the institution's board of directors establishes the institution's overall appetite for risk (especially reputational and legal) and effectively communicates the board's risk tolerances throughout the organization. Implement firm-wide policies and procedures that provide for the consistent identification, evaluation, documentation, and management of all risks associated with complex structured finance transactions--in particular, the credit, reputational, and legal risks. Implement firm-wide policies and procedures that ensure that the financial institution obtains a thorough understanding of the business purposes and economic substance of those transactions identified as involving heightened legal or reputational risk and that those transactions are approved by appropriate senior management. Clearly define the framework for the approval of individual complex structured finance transactions as well as new complex structured finance product lines within the context of the firm's new-product approval process. The new-product policies for complex structured finance transactions should address the roles and responsibilities of all relevant parties and should require the approval of all relevant control areas that are independent of the profit center before the transaction is offered to customers. Finally, implement monitoring, risk-reporting, and compliance processes for creating, analyzing, offering, and marketing complex structured finance products. Subsequent to new-product approval, the firm should monitor new complex structured finance products to ensure that they are effectively incorporated into the firm's risk-control systems. Of course, these internal controls and risk-management processses need to be supported and enforced by a strong "tone at the top" and a firm-wide culture of compliance. We expect that banks, as a result of recent public and supervisory attention to complex structured finance transactions, will be asking more questions, requesting additional documentation, and scrutinizing financial statements more carefully to guard against reputational and legal risk. In fact, our supervisory reviews indicate that many financial institutions have already taken steps to enhance their internal controls and new-product approval processes in order to filter out transactions that pose unacceptable levels of reputational and legal risk. As a result, some financial institutions have turned down deals with unfavorable risk characteristics--deals that they might have accepted in the past. While we applaud these developments, we hope that the guidance we are developing will help further increase awareness, among both banking organizations and their advisers, of sound practices in this area. I would like to note that the guidance the agencies issue should be considered the first step in the evolution of sound practices for complex structured finance transactions. As these transactions take on new characteristics or different or heightened levels of risk over time, the sound practices for managing them also will need to evolve. Credit Risk Transfer Some of the complex structured finance transactions we have recently seen reflect and incorporate innovations in credit risk transfer mechanisms--credit default swaps and synthetic collateralized debt obligations in particular. As most of you know, credit default swaps involve the sale or transfer of credit risk associated with a specific reference entity for a fixed term in exchange for a fee from the buyer of the protection. Synthetic collateralized debt obligations entail similar arrangements but are based on portfolios of exposures and are tranched in a manner typically seen in securitizations. Credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations provide flexibility in tailoring and marketing financial transactions to match the risk appetites of investors. One aspect that we, as bank supervisors, find encouraging about the growth of credit risk transfer activity is the diversification benefit it provides and its potential for greater economic efficiency. By their design, derivative instruments segment risks for distribution to those parties most willing to accept them. A key point, however, is that these parties should be able to successfully absorb and diffuse any subsequent loss. The ability to handle any losses on these instruments requires a recognition and understanding of the underlying risks. It is important to recognize that the market for these instruments is dominated by large institutions and private investors that have specialized expertise in credit analysis and significant historical performance records. As bank supervisors, we are also encouraged by the progress made by the legal profession to resolve legal issues relating to credit risk transfer. The standardization of documentation for credit derivatives transactions and the issuance of legal opinions regarding the enforceability of these contracts have provided increased certainty to the market. In general, the contracts have performed as expected. By way of note, the Federal Reserve is participating in work commissioned last year by the Financial Stability Forum to gain a broader understanding of issues related to credit risk transfer. I look forward to the conclusions and assessments of this group. Little evidence, to date, suggests that the institutions and investors that engage in most of the credit risk transfer activities fail to understand the risks of these transactions. That said, I would offer one critical caveat regarding the use of any model for risk- management purposes, including the pricing and risk management of increasingly complex credit risk transfer instruments. Models use historic data and rely heavily on supporting assumptions, including correlations between different reference entities. It is worth reminding ourselves that correlations may behave very differently during times of stress than under normal circumstances. Further, these are relatively young products, and the markets in which they trade often do not have deep liquidity. Thus, pricing information can be very volatile. Given the heavy reliance on models in this arena, it is important that any risk- management framework include an independent model review program. A review should be conducted by qualified independent staff prior to actual reliance on a model, and periodically thereafter. Tests should include validation of results, data integrity, and internal controls over changes in model specifications. Models should be appropriate for the specific products and the nature of the risks at an institution. Enterprise-Wide Risk-Management Framework The recent innovations in credit risk transfer and complex structured finance transactions offer opportunities for the development of new markets, improved pricing, and better risk-transfer mechanisms that can improve the efficiency of U.S. and world financial markets. However, innovation also presents risk-management challenges. I believe that these challenges are addressed most effectively through an enterprise-wide risk-management framework that provides a structure for dealing with uncertainty and its associated risks and opportunities. As you may know, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, has published an exposure draft that sets forth an enterprise-wide risk-management framework, including the definition and components of risk management and the roles and responsibilities of various parties. Enterprise-wide risk management is a process that involves people at every level of the firm in setting strategy and making operational decisions based on an analysis of events that may impact the firm. Through an enterprise-wide risk-management framework, an entity can better limit exposures within its risk appetite and provide its management and board of directors with reasonable assurances regarding the achievement of the organization's objectives. Recent operational breakdowns at financial institutions underscore the need for enterprise-wide risk-management. As organizations expand into more lines of business, inherent conflicts of interest become more likely. Conflicts can arise when a firm offers research on fixed-income securities to investors and underwrites the public offerings of the same securities. And problems may occur if an organization offers compensation designed to encourage officers to increase deal volume without regard for reputational, credit, or legal risks. Thus, the traditional approach of managing risks only within individual business lines or functions may no longer be effective. Viewing risks across the enterprise can help management and the board of directors not only articulate more clearly the "most likely" outcome of a strategy, change in process, or transaction but, more important, focus on a range of possible results to facilitate a discussion of risks and effectiveness of processes to lay off or mitigate those risks. Internal controls are an integral part of enterprise-wide risk management. Under COSO's Internal Control Framework, directors have responsibility for overseeing internal control processes so that they can reasonably expect that their directives will be followed. Directors should also keep up with innovations in corporate governance, and this is one key area in which the legal advisers of financial companies can assist their clients. Indeed, legal counsel can help lead the way to developing sound practices in corporate governance. While we are discussing the importance of effective internal controls, let me point out that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) has recently approved Auditing Standard No. 2, An Audit of Internal Control over Financial Reporting Performed in Conjunction with an Audit of Financial Statements . The new standard highlights the benefits of strong internal controls over financial reporting and furthers the objectives of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The standard requires external auditors of public companies to evaluate the process that management uses to prepare the company's financial statements. External auditors must gather evidence regarding the design and operational effectiveness of the company's internal controls and determine whether evidence supports management's assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal controls. While the new standard allows external auditors to use the work of others, including that performed by internal auditors, it emphasizes that external auditors must perform enough of the testing themselves so that their own work provides the principal evidence for making a determination regarding the company's controls. On the basis of the work performed, the external auditor must render an opinion as to whether the company's internal control process is effective--a requirement that constitutes a relatively high standard. In addition, as part of its overall assessment of internal controls, the external auditor is expected to evaluate the effectiveness of the audit committee. If the audit committee is deemed to be ineffective, the external auditor is required to report that assessment to the company's board of directors. While some skeptics may wonder if a public accountant will criticize its client, the goals are to strengthen professional standards and to remind accounting firms that acceptance of an engagement at a firm at which internal control weaknesses are not promptly addressed may be a risk exposure they should seriously reconsider. I would encourage the attorneys here today to adopt the best practices in risk management that the accounting and financial firms are implementing to improve their organizations' governance. Conclusion In conclusion, the financial services industry has evolved considerably over the past several years, in large part because of innovation in products, services, and activities, particularly in the areas of complex structured finance transactions, credit risk transfer, and risk management. These innovations have the potential, I believe, to substantially improve the efficiency of the financial markets. However, these new products, services, and activities present challenges. Legal counsel can play an important role in helping financial institution clients understand and address these challenges through the development of a sound enterprise-wide risk-management framework.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Financial literacy At the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicagos Money Smart Conference, Chicago, Illinois (via videoconference) May 13, 2004 This morning I should like to broaden the focus of financial literacy to the education you are going to need more generally in the years ahead. Within the next several years the vast majority of you will have completed your formal schooling and begun careers in private business, government, or the nonprofit sector. I suspect most of you have not as yet figured out what career you would like to pursue. But as with all the generations of teenagers that have gone before you, something will grab your interest and engage you. With me it was music. I was entranced with sound and visualized myself playing with the likes of the Glenn Miller orchestra or becoming another Benny Goodman. I practiced clarinet and saxophone three to five hours a day and, following graduation from high school, toured the country for a couple of years with a dance band. I was a good amateur but only an average professional. I soon realized that there was a limit to how far I could rise in the music business, so I left the band and enrolled at New York University. During my dance band years I spent the twenty-minute breaks from playing in reading. I became intrigued by books on finance, and, hence, at NYU I majored first in finance and, as my interest broadened, in economics and in what was then called mathematical statistics and now econometrics. In retrospect, that choice probably was not surprising since math was my most engaging course in high school. I graduated and joined an economic research organization. But my education did not stop. I earned a masters degree and went on to further studies at night at Columbia University. At the age of twenty-seven I joined a very small Wall Street firm as a partner and was essentially in charge of making it grow. It did, and I eventually became the senior partner. But twelve hours a day at work left little time for school, and my aspirations to earn a Ph.D. faded, at least for a time. However, the pursuit of my profession as an economist and the head of a consulting firm required that I broaden my knowledge, and I proceeded to read books, not only on economics and mathematics but also on philosophy, history, physics, and astronomy. I was getting a liberal education far beyond the required curriculum of college. Eventually I returned to NYU, took additional courses at night, and completed my doctorate. Over the past six decades I followed a type of career path that many of you will follow, but with a twenty-first-century cast. I had two careers and four jobs--one as a musician, one as a private consultant, and two in government. But the world has changed since I was your age, and the pace of change has quickened. Today it is rare that one will finish school and then engage in the same job until retirement, which was the general experience of generations past. Many of you will switch professions once, possibly many times. Almost all of you will have several jobs, some many jobs. To succeed, you will soon learn, as I did, the importance of a solid foundation in the basics of education--literacy, both verbal and numerical, and communication skills. But beyond that you will need to acquire the on-the-job skills that you will need as you move from one job to another. At some point, almost all of you will lose a job and will want to be reemployed as quickly and as productively as possible. That means you will need the capability of learning a wholly new activity. The current workforce is increasingly turning to community colleges to prepare for new professions and new jobs. Today, almost a third of those enrolled in community colleges are thirty years old and older. So-called adult education was a rarity in my youth; today it is widespread. Most of you probably will be engaged in some form of learning through most of your working lives. Already numerous corporations have regularly scheduled classes in basic and advanced subjects directly and indirectly related to job requirements. Such corporate universities, as they are called, are growing rapidly, and I suspect that, as you join the workforce, you will have the sensation that you never left school. That is why it is so critical that you productively employ your current learning experiences to create the base capabilities necessary for continuing your education into your mature years. Learning, of course, need not be formal. You can engage in it on your own. In generations past, much learning occurred outside a classroom. I am fascinated by the eloquent and literate letters written by some Civil War enlisted personnel, who I doubt had formal schooling beyond the age of ten. Many of these soldiers obviously learned to read and discovered a whole new world of ideas in books. Today's high-school graduates will be confronted with a breadth of ideas never contemplated by an eighteen year old in the 1860s. The world into which you graduate will require far greater conceptual skills than was required of your parents and grandparents. Productive and satisfying manual labor that engaged previous generations will become increasingly less available as technology substitutes for so many of those earlier skills. Your future incomes will depend on your conceptual abilities. Just as important, because the complexity of our economic system continues to increase, the skill level that you reach in your twenties will surely be inadequate for the needs of our economy when you reach forty. So education must be ongoing. But education alone will not guarantee a successful life. In this regard, let me leave you with some challenges I left with a graduating class at Harvard a few years ago. Decades from now, as you begin to contemplate retirement, you will want to be able to say that whatever success you achieved was the result of honest and productive work and that you dealt with people the way you would want them to deal with you. It is decidedly not true that "nice guys finish last," as that highly original American baseball philosopher, Leo Durocher, was alleged to have said. I do not deny that many appear to have succeeded in a material way by cutting corners and by manipulating associates, both in their professional and in their personal lives. But material success is possible in this world and far more satisfying when it comes without exploiting others. The true measure of a career is to be able to be content, even proud, that you succeeded through your own endeavors without leaving a trail of casualties in your wake. I cannot speak for others whose psyches I may not be able to comprehend. But in my working life, I have found no greater satisfaction than achieving success through honest dealing and strict adherence to the view that, for you to gain, those you deal with should gain as well. Human relations--be they personal or professional--are not, and should not be treated as, zero-sum games.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to speak today on matters relating to the informal U.S.-EU Financial Markets Regulatory Dialogue. I would like to focus my remarks on the Dialogue's role in helping us to monitor European-wide regulatory developments in financial services and understand the effects on U.S. banking organizations operating in the European Union. Background to the Dialogue As has been noted, the Dialogue was initiated by the Treasury Department in 2002, at a time of significant regulatory developments in both the European Union and in the United States. At that time, the European Union was continuing its efforts, begun in 1999, to establish a single market in financial services by implementing the "Financial Services Action Plan" (FSAP). The FSAP consists of a number of regulatory and legislative measures designed to achieve, among other things, a single wholesale European market; open and secure retail markets; and state-of-the-art prudential rules and supervision. On our side of the Atlantic, U.S. regulators were continuing to implement provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Congress was considering reforms that led to the adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These developments, which affected European financial services firms with U.S. operations, naturally were of interest to staff of the European Commission. From the outset, the Dialogue's purpose has been to foster a better mutual understanding of U.S. and EU regulatory approaches and to identify potential substantive conflicts in approach as early in the regulatory process as possible. The Dialogue consists of an informal discussion or explanation of regulatory approaches, developments, and timetables, conducted at an experts level. This format has served us well during the past two years. Although the Federal Reserve has regular contact with staff of the European Commission in other groups on a range of issues, the Dialogue is the only venue dedicated specifically to U.S.-EU regulatory issues. Federal Reserve's Interest in Monitoring Foreign Regulatory Developments As the umbrella supervisor of U.S. bank holding companies and financial holding companies, the Federal Reserve has a strong interest in the regulatory environments in which these firms operate outside the United States. We have an established program of working with foreign supervisors at both bilateral and multilateral levels. Through regular contact, we track changes to foreign bank regulatory and supervisory systems and seek to understand how these systems affect the banking institutions we supervise. This is especially important in the European Union, where U.S. banking organizations have substantial operations. As of September 30, 2003, thirty-four U.S. banking organizations operated in the European Union with aggregate EU assets of more than $747 billion. As of December 31, 2003, sixty-eight EU banking organizations maintained active banking operations in the United States, with total third-party banking assets in their U.S. offices of $937 billion. As these figures suggest, institutions from the United States and the EU are major participants in each other's markets. The Dialogue as an Additional Forum for Monitoring EU Regulatory Developments As the EU seeks increasingly to harmonize financial services rules across its internal market, the regulatory role of the European Commission has grown correspondingly. In this environment, the Dialogue complements the Federal Reserve's ongoing relationships and discussions with EU national regulators. The Dialogue, moreover, fills a role not presently served by any one of those ongoing relationships and discussions. As the market for financial services becomes increasingly integrated, the interests of banking, securities, and insurance regulators correspondingly are becoming more common and intertwined. The Dialogue provides a forum for discussion of issues in each of these areas. The regulatory discussions benefit from this sharing of different substantive perspectives. For this reason, too, the Dialogue is an efficient forum for information exchange, which has great utility for supervisors of large complex financial services organizations. Global companies operate across many countries and must adapt their business and strategy to local regulatory and supervisory requirements. It is now generally accepted in the U.S. and internationally that a foreign firm that conducts business in a local market should receive national treatment, that is, the foreign firm should be treated no less favorably than a domestic firm operating in like circumstances. The United States adopted a specific policy of national treatment for foreign banks operating in this country with the enactment of the International Banking Act of 1978. As we have previously testified, implementing a policy of national treatment can be challenging. Although large financial services companies operate in a globalized world, each is based in a specific country whose economic regulation or supervisory approach will differ from those in other countries. The challenge of providing national treatment arises as we seek to adapt our own regulatory system to a foreign banking organization that operates under a different legal and regulatory structure. We believe the Federal Reserve has successfully met the challenge in its treatment of foreign banking organizations operating in this country. Part of that success can be attributed to our work with foreign regulators and supervisors in seeking to understand the operating environment of the foreign banks we regulate. The Dialogue contributes to that knowledge. We are equally concerned that U.S. banking organizations receive national treatment in their foreign operations. The Dialogue provides us the best opportunity to understand EU directives that affect those operations and provides us with the ability to raise concerns directly with the staff that has responsibility for the preparation and presentation of such directives. The Dialogue provides a useful forum for information exchange between U.S. regulators and the European Union over Europe-wide matters that have the potential to affect the application of national treatment in particular situations. In implementing the FSAP in the European Union, the European Union has an obligation to ensure that the rules adopted are consistent with the principle of national treatment. It is our expectation that the European Commission and the member states will continue to seek to do so. Select Issues Discussed During the Dialogue The Dialogue has touched on a variety of issues in the past two years. Of particular interest to the Federal Reserve and to U.S. banking organizations operating in the EU is the issue of the application of the EU's Financial Conglomerates Directive to U.S. financial firms. This Directive, and others that have been amended in connection with its adoption, establishes various supervisory requirements for EU firms. Among other matters, it requires that the consolidated group be subject to supervision and minimum capital standards by a member state authority. For firms that are headquartered outside the EU, such as U.S. banking organizations, the directives require that the foreign financial firm operating in EU markets must be subject to supervision at the holding company level by a competent home country authority, which supervision is equivalent to that provided for by the provisions of the Directive. The EU's national supervisors will be responsible for making equivalency determinations on a group-by-group basis, in accordance with guidance issued by the European Commission. In the absence of an equivalence determination, U.S. financial firms with EU operations could be subject to higher capital and risk control requirements or be required to create an EU sub-holding company. The European Commission is preparing guidance on what might constitute equivalent supervision by third countries. In preparing this guidance, committees working under the auspices of the Commission convened a technical group comprised of member state supervisors to provide input on issues to be taken into account in verifying equivalence. The group sent questionnaires to home country supervisors of financial organizations having operations in the EU, inquiring about the measures those supervisors take to ensure that the entities they supervise are subject to consolidated supervision at the top-tier level. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency prepared a joint response on supervision of U.S. banking organizations with EU operations. We understand that the EC's guidance is expected to be issued in the summer. Member state lead regulators are expected to rely on the European Commission's guidance in verifying equivalent supervision with respect to individual institutions. We anticipate that the European Commission will keep us informed of member states' progress in this regard during the Dialogue and also will alert us to the existence of and procedures for addressing any disparities in member states' approaches. We fully expect that U.S. banking organizations will be found to meet the supervision standard of the directive. Another topic of discussion relating to banks has been the status of work on revisions to the Basel Capital Accord (Basel II). The discussions within the Dialogue have not focused on technical issues that have been under consideration within the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), but rather have addressed the scope of application and implementation and timing concerns. Specifically, the Dialogue has served as a useful venue for both the EU representatives and the Federal Reserve participants to gain a better understanding of the implementation procedures that are anticipated to be applicable in each jurisdiction. Staff has been able to ask questions about the EU legislative process, and to explain in detail how the U.S. regulatory process functions. Understanding the requirements and limitations of each others' legislative and regulatory processes has helped both sides achieve, in my view, a better sense of the implementation challenges we all face and of the commitment to see the process through. With regard to the scope of application of the proposed new Accord, the Federal Reserve representatives were able to provide information for the EU participants about the reasons the U.S. banking agencies proposed to require only a core set of banks to apply the advanced approaches for both credit risk and operational risk. As you know, one of the primary drivers behind this decision was the U.S. banking agencies' collective view that complex, sophisticated organizations should be using the most advanced risk measurement and management practices available and those techniques and practices are recognized in the Basel II advanced approaches. The U.S. agencies also proposed permitting other institutions to move voluntarily to the advanced approaches subject to the same rigorous risk measurement and management requirements as core banks. Through the Dialogue, the participants were able to discuss the U.S. approach and to compare it with the EU proposal to apply Basel II to all of its banks and investment companies. These different implementation strategies will raise some issues, and that is why the Basel Committee has created the Accord Implementation Group to coordinate implementation across jurisdictions and work through home-host issues. As noted, issues are not resolved during Dialogue discussions; that is not the purpose of the Dialogue. But open communication that fosters understanding can feed back into the decision-making discussions when they are held in other appropriate forums. With respect to Basel II implementation and the Dialogue, in my view, the current structure will continue to serve a useful purpose--as implementation issues are identified, the Dialogue can be a venue for candid, informal communication. Participants can take back to their constituents the results of those discussions and the subject matter experts can determine how best to address issues that are raised or respond to particular questions or concerns. The Dialogue has been useful in diffusing tensions over matters that have a direct impact on global firms. This has been especially true with respect to issues under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a discussion of which I shall leave to my SEC colleague. The Dialogue has also been helpful on less high profile matters. Through discussions at Dialogue meetings, we were able to keep EC staff apprised of developments relating to asset pledge requirements applicable to foreign banking organizations having U.S. offices. For more than forty years, federal and state bank licensing authorities have imposed an asset pledge or capital equivalency deposit requirement on U.S. branches and agencies of international banks, primarily for safety and soundness reasons. This requirement obligated such institutions to hold certain negotiable securities at American custodian banks. In recent years, foreign banks were of the view that such requirements were more onerous than necessary and sought a reduction in the level of assets to be pledged. The matter was brought to the attention of European Commission staff who raised it at the Dialogue. We were able to inform Commission staff of progress being made on this front by state authorities in New York and elsewhere over a two-year period. New York changed its asset pledge requirement in 2003, generally satisfying the concerns of foreign banks. The Dialogue was a useful forum to keep Commission staff apprised of developments during this period. International Accounting The FSAP also contemplates mandating adherence to international accounting standards. Currently, banking organizations in the European Union may prepare their annual financial statements in accordance with the accounting standards of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), and/or national standards. The use of U.S. GAAP is usually limited to those banking organizations or other companies whose securities are publicly traded on U.S. stock exchanges and are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In many cases, these companies will also provide separate financial statements based on their national accounting standards and disclosure rules. The European Union will require all EU companies listed on EU exchanges that are currently following national standards to follow IASB standards by 2005 and will require those EU companies that currently follow U.S. GAAP to adopt IASB standards by 2007. The EU is also working to adopt international auditing standards for external audits of EU companies, including banks. The IASB is now independent of the international accounting profession and independently funded. It has adopted many of the structural elements of the FASB in the United States, which are intended to promote an independent, objective standards-setting environment. Many senior American accounting experts serve on the IASB and its staff. IASB GAAP has many similarities with U.S. GAAP and the IASB issued extensive enhancements to its standards last year and this year, with additional improvements also issued as a proposal this year. For example, in recent months the IASB issued major revisions to its standards for financial instruments, which are similar to U.S. GAAP and cover many areas of banking activities. One aspect of these revisions by the IASB significantly improved the guidance on loan loss allowances in ways that could lead to better bank reserving practices around the world. The Federal Reserve has long supported sound accounting policies and meaningful public disclosure by banking and financial organizations with the objective of improving market discipline and fostering stable financial markets. The concept of market discipline is assuming greater importance among international banking supervisors as well. Basel II seeks to strengthen the market's ability to aid bank supervisors in evaluating banking organizations' risks and assessing capital adequacy. It consists of three pillars, or tools: a minimum risk-based capital requirement (pillar I), risk-based supervision (pillar II), and disclosure of risks and capital adequacy to enhance market discipline (pillar III). This approach to capital regulation, with its market-discipline component, signals that sound accounting and disclosure will continue to be important aspects of our supervisory approach. The Federal Reserve and the other U.S. banking agencies are also actively involved in the efforts of the Basel Committee to promote sound international accounting, auditing, and disclosure standards and practices for global banking organizations and other companies. For example, an official of the Federal Reserve Board is a member of the Standards Advisory Council that advises the IASB and its trustees on IASB projects, proposals and standards. The U.S. banking agencies have been active in supporting the Basel Committee in its work with the IASB's technical advisory groups to enhance the IASB's standards for financial instruments and bank disclosures. The Federal Reserve Board has also been active in supporting the Basel Committee's projects with the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and other international regulatory organizations, such as International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), to promote substantial enhancements to global standards and practices for audits of banks and other companies. Although the Federal Reserve Board has been actively involved in addressing international accounting and auditing issues primarily through our involvement in the Basel Committee's projects, the Securities and Exchange Commission has had the primary role in discussing these matters with the EU representatives as part of the Dialogue. Cooperation on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Issues While not historically part of the U.S.-EU Dialogue, recent anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulatory initiatives on both sides of the Atlantic have had a significant impact on banking organizations, many of which operate globally. Because of the potential consequences of differences in regulatory approaches in this area, governments have been in frequent contact. In the end, the anti-money laundering provisions set forth in the USA PATRIOT Act and those contained in the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive are generally in harmony. Part of this can be attributed to the Federal Reserve's and other U.S. and EU regulatory authorities' mutual involvement in multilateral policy efforts to improve regulatory systems so to prevent these crimes, such as the Financial Action Task Force and the Basel Committee's cross-border banking group. On a practical level, supervisory dialogue and cooperation on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing also has been necessary due to the role the Federal Reserve frequently shares with its EU counterparts as "home/host" supervisors of global banking organizations. However, this cooperation is typically focused on providing assistance in order to fulfill supervisory mandates, not to conduct money laundering or terrorist financing investigations, the authority for which typically falls with law enforcement authorities. While Bank Secrecy Act requirements, including the provisions added by the USA PATRIOT Act, generally do not extend to foreign operations of U.S. banking organizations, the Federal Reserve is interested in understanding the global operations of the banking organizations under Federal Reserve supervision as a matter of safety and soundness. In this regard, the Federal Reserve relies upon communication with supervisors from foreign jurisdictions, including EU member states, in which banking organizations subject to Federal Reserve supervision have material operations. Critical information obtained in the course of an examination, which may impact a banking organization's operations in the foreign jurisdiction, is typically exchanged among relevant supervisors. For example, when a Federal Reserve Bank conducts an on-site examination of a foreign banking organization in the United States, and significant problems are identified with regard to its anti-money laundering program, the Federal Reserve contacts the home country supervisor to discuss the findings and to develop corrective action plans. Moreover, the Federal Reserve may provide information to European Union member bank supervisors when administrative penalties have been imposed or any other formal enforcement action has been taken against a U.S. banking organization (whether or not it is related to anti-money laundering requirements) if the Federal Reserve believes such information will be important to the host country supervisor. The Federal Reserve expects the same from its counterparts. Future of the Dialogue As is evident from the tenor of my remarks, the Federal Reserve has found the Dialogue to be a useful vehicle for monitoring the rapid regulatory developments in the European Union and exchanging information. We are committed to continuing discussions with the Commission on matters of mutual interest, both bilaterally and as part of the financial markets regulatory discussions led by the Treasury Department. The regulatory landscape in the European Union is certain to continue to develop rapidly in the coming years, particularly with expansion of the European Union, member states' implementation of the numerous FSAP measures needed to create a single market for financial services, and the growing integration of our capital markets. We at the Federal Reserve have an obligation to keep apprised of these developments on a timely basis in order to fulfill our supervisory function and to ensure a level playing field for U.S. banking organizations operating in the European Union. We are confident that continuing the Dialogue in its present form would facilitate these objectives. We are equally confident that other existing multilateral and bilateral exchange mechanisms are appropriate venues for discussing policies and attempting to resolve disputes. In our view, formalizing the Dialogue--for example, by elevating it to the principals level or expanding its mandate to include policy-setting or dispute resolution functions--would be unnecessary and may impair the Dialogue's utility. The Federal Reserve believes that U.S. banks are second to none in their ability to compete when they are given the opportunity of operating on a level playing field. Providing strong supervision at home and participating in international regulatory and supervisory groups such as the Dialogue helps assure that our banking organizations will continue to have such opportunities.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced the issuance of a against Riggs National Corporation, Washington, D.C., a bank holding company, and Riggs International Banking Corporation, Miami, Florida, an Edge corporation. Riggs National Corporation and Riggs International Banking Corporation, without admitting to any allegations, consented to the issuance of the Order in connection with deficiencies relating to the lack of oversight, internal controls and procedures to ensure compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act. In separate, coordinated actions, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network announced the issuance of a consent order and the assessment of a civil money penalty against Riggs Bank, N.A., a subsidiary of Riggs National Corporation and the parent of Riggs International Banking Corporation. The order and penalty relate to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.

Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. At the National Bank of Belgium Conference on Efficiency and Stability in an Evolving Financial System, Brussels, Belgium May 17, 2004 The Role of Central Banks in Fostering Efficiency and Stability in the Global Financial System It is a great pleasure for me to open this conference. Our agenda is filled with addresses by distinguished speakers and research papers of uniformly high quality on topics of keen interest to central bankers. Indeed, few subjects are more important for central bankers than the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Many of the papers to be presented and discussed over the next two days focus on the behavior of private institutions operating in financial markets. I thought I could complement these presentations by discussing the efforts of an important class of public institutions--central banks--to foster efficiency and stability in the financial system. Before proceeding, I should note that my remarks today represent my own views, which are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or on the Federal Open Market Committee. In previous discussions, I have found it useful to offer a working definition of financial instability that seems most relevant from a public-policy perspective. Although difficult to define precisely, financial instability, in my view, connotes the presence of market imperfections or externalities in the financial system that are substantial enough to create significant risks for real aggregate economic performance. Over the past few decades, economic research has identified a variety of imperfections inherent in markets, such as moral hazard, asymmetric information, and externalities. On occasion, these imperfections can become so widespread and significant as to result in outcomes that threaten the functioning of the financial system and adversely affect real economic variables. History suggests that these imperfections reach this advanced and disruptive stage when they are exacerbated by large external shocks. Such outcomes include panics, bank runs, severe market illiquidity, and excessive risk aversion. These outcomes are highly undesirable for society because they can be accompanied by a variety of economic distortions: Financial prices can diverge sharply and for prolonged periods from fundamentals, and their correction is likely to impose great cost on society; the availability and pricing of credit may be too lax at times and at other times too restrictive relative to underlying macroeconomic conditions. As a result of these distortions, spending and real activity may undergo much wider swings than would otherwise be the case. I would hasten to add, however, that this definition of financial instability does not encompass failures of financial firms due to poor management or poor luck; nor does it include fluctuations in asset prices or credit conditions as a consequence of the normal evolution of economic circumstances, nor occasional substantial losses of individual counterparties. Indeed, such failures and losses, as well as accompanying market volatility, are the unavoidable and even necessary features of dynamic market economies. In my view, market volatility and institutional stresses need to be addressed by public-policy action only when they are symptomatic of, and interact with, more-fundamental market failures that have a high likelihood of impairing real macroeconomic performance. Indeed, public policies that rely too heavily on regulation of financial institutions, instruments, and markets with the aim of avoiding any period of financial stress almost surely entail a significant cost measured in terms of increased moral hazard, lower economic growth, and financial markets that do not always allocate resources to their most productive use. In my experience, central bankers as a rule have an almost instinctive aversion to financial instability as I have defined it. Those instincts are no doubt rooted, at least partly, in the historical efforts of many nations to overcome structural defects in financial markets that left their economies prone to boom-and-bust cycles. In some cases, central banks were seen as part of the solution in addressing the results of such market imperfections. The Federal Reserve, for example, owes its existence in large measure to the financial panics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the United States that increased public recognition of the need for a lender of last resort, for more-effective bank supervision, and for greater efficiency in the payment system. In the modern era, central banks' association with matters relating to financial stability has become broader and more formalized. To be sure, many central bank charters give primacy to broad macroeconomic objectives such as price stability and full employment. And, indeed, I concur with those who argue that conducting monetary policy over time so as to achieve stable prices and sustainable economic growth is the single most important contribution that central banks can make in promoting financial stability. However, many central bank charters also recognize financial stability as an important and distinct objective, and these statutory objectives have been prominently discussed in the time since I joined the ranks of central bankers in 1997. Over that relatively brief span, the global financial system has weathered many storms--the market turmoil in the fall of 1998, the preparations for Y2K, devastating terrorist attacks in 2001 and a recognition of the threat of future attacks, and major accounting scandals in 2002. As I will discuss in more detail shortly, these developments have been important in shaping the international central banking policy agenda. Key Financial Trends Before exploring some of these issues in a bit more depth, it seems useful to consider some of the longer-run trends that have set the backdrop for much of the work of central banks in international forums dealing with financial efficiency and stability. One clear trend in many countries is an increase in market concentration in the banking sector and in other sectors of the financial services industry. In the United States, for example, the share of assets held by the top ten commercial banks has risen from about 30 percent in 1995 to about 45 percent today. Outside the commercial banking sector, consolidation has resulted in a small number of financial firms doing much of the equity and bond underwriting throughout the world. A second trend is the steadily increasing share of total credit provided directly through markets rather than through intermediaries like banks. For example, in the United States, the share of bank loans in the total outstanding debt of domestic nonfinancial corporations has declined from about 21 percent at the end of 1990 to 12 percent at the end of last year. The growing importance of market-based finance has not, however, signaled a decline in the commercial banking industry. U.S. banks, for example, have enjoyed record profits that stem, in part, from their activities in securities markets and in the development of new instruments. Indeed, banks' development of sophisticated risk-management techniques helped to fuel the growth of new financial instruments. More generally, by providing lines of credit and assuming other off-balance-sheet exposures, banks support the advancement and ongoing operation of financial markets and lower the costs of market-based finance for many market participants. Another important trend has been the expanding scope and availability of financial instruments. The global financial system is still well short of the theoretical ideal of complete financial markets, but clearly it is moving in that direction. Market participants now use an array of financial instruments that, twenty years ago, were not actively traded and, in many cases, did not even exist. The growth of derivatives is a useful example of this trend. According to the December 2003 survey of derivatives conducted by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the notional and market values of all over-the-counter foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives contracts--rough measures of market activity--have nearly doubled in just the past two years. The credit derivatives market is still in its infancy, but data gathered by the International Swap Dealers Association suggest that this market has registered even more spectacular growth in the past two years. All of these new instruments allow more-effective management and pricing of risks, so the growth of these markets has surely been positive, on net, for market participants. But the increasing complexity of these instruments also raises a host of policy questions regarding, to name just a few items, accounting treatment, disclosure policy, netting provisions, capital charges, and the enforceability of netting and collateral arrangements in bankruptcy proceedings. A final trend worth singling out is the steady increase in global financial integration. Borrowers today raise funds in multiple financial centers and in multiple currencies; commercial lenders and retail investors regularly take on international exposures; and arbitrageurs establish leveraged risk positions across currencies and markets. Data collected by the BIS, for example, suggest that the volume of debt outstanding that was issued in international credit markets has more than doubled worldwide in the past four years. Likewise, the international positions of banks worldwide have increased almost as markedly over the same interval. For the most part, these developments suggest that global financial markets are becoming more efficient and more integrated. But increased global financial integration carries with it some new risks. As we learned all too well following the Russian debt default in August 1998, financial difficulties in one corner of the world can now spread in unpredictable and potentially disruptive ways to every major financial center. In the remainder of my remarks this morning, I will draw out some of the implications of these long-run trends for the core responsibilities of many central banks, which include the conduct of monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and crisis management and liquidity assistance. Monetary Policy The steadily increasing importance of markets and nonbank instruments as the primary vehicles for borrowing and lending has several important implications for monetary policy transmission and strategy. It seems plausible, for example, that a financial system dominated by market-based finance has likely reinforced the status of the market for financial assets as the most important channel of monetary policy transmission. This simple observation has some rather profound implications for the conduct of monetary policy. Typically, central banks directly control a short-term interest rate, but the forward-looking nature of financial markets implies that long-term interest rates and other asset prices are determined importantly by expectations about future policy. These expectations, in turn, are informed (one hopes) by a clear understanding of the objectives of the central bank and how it will choose to set policy in the future in response to economic developments. Central banks have long recognized the effect their words and actions can have on interest rates and asset prices and, as a result, have increasingly moved toward greater transparency in the policy process. The sharpened focus on transparency has been motivated in part by a desire to avoid short-run misperceptions about policymakers' intentions that can distort financial asset prices and ultimately prove detrimental to the real economy. But central bankers have also discovered that transparency, broadly writ, can lead to improved economic performance. Market expectations are more likely to remain anchored in the face of various shocks when investors understand that central bankers are committed to key long-run objectives such as price stability and sustainable economic growth. Moreover, by operating in a predictable way in response to economic developments, central bankers can foster an "automatic stabilizer" of sorts in financial markets. For example, recognizing that the central bank will seek to counter adverse demand shocks, investors will anticipate an easing in monetary policy if they observe aggregate demand weakening; in turn, that anticipation would soon be reflected in lower long-term interest rates that would cushion the drop in demand even before a change in policy is made. This market dynamic suggests that gauging the overall effect of monetary policy requires an assessment of broad financial conditions, including policy rates, long-term interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Although central bankers can use predictable policy actions and the forward-looking nature of financial prices to their advantage, they must also be mindful of the potential market reactions to policy actions that are not fully anticipated or that may be misinterpreted. This, too, is an aspect of monetary policy that may have become more prominent given the evolution of financial markets in recent years. Monetary policymakers evaluate the probabilities as well as the costs and benefits of the full range of potential economic and financial outcomes in arriving at a policy decision. One such risk to be evaluated is the potential, particularly during times of stress, for outsized and unintended changes in interest rates and asset prices after an unexpected policy action. Of course, the response of central banks to this risk should not be to avoid taking policy actions that are necessary to achieve macroeconomic objectives. But central banks can mitigate the potential for unintended market reactions by communicating their goals and economic outlook as clearly as possible to inform market expectations and thereby avoid possible misperceptions about the future path for policy. The record shows that on occasion monetary policy has been used to counter financial instability. These incidents arise when financial instability is so great that the financial markets themselves seem to become incapable of intermediating effectively and, partially as a result of these market weaknesses, the economic outlook has been revised down sharply and the downside risks to that outlook have become quite large. Naturally, at those moments, asset prices as well as market functioning become a focus for policymakers. However, this does not mean that policymakers have particular targets for those asset prices--that they seek to place a floor under such prices, as some have inferred. Rather, in those situations asset prices are evaluated in the context of all the factors bearing on the economic outlook, just as when markets are orderly, though financial market conditions in all their aspects play a particularly prominent role in such an evaluation when markets are stressed. Bank Supervision The concentration in banking structures that I referred to earlier, coupled with the growing scope of permissible bank activities paralleling the evolving nature of the world's financial markets, has had some profound effects on bank supervision. For one thing, supervisors worldwide have increasingly shifted the emphasis of their concern toward large banks' internal risk-management policies and systems and relatively away from individual bank positions and transactions. Much of this shift in emphasis has reflected changes in banks' own internal policies, as increases in the scale and scope of operations have required different control and management systems to maximize risk-adjusted profits. In addition, the change has reflected the need to alter supervisory strategy to address the reality that earlier techniques are inadequate for large, complex entities, especially given supervisors' limited resources. The same motivations have induced U.S. and other supervisors to emphasize transparency and disclosure by the largest banks in order to exploit the potential market discipline as a supervisory supplement. Market discipline, in turn, requires not only disclosure, but also the expectation that bank counterparties face a risk of loss. Government guarantees in the name of stability may actually pose a greater risk of bank difficulties by reducing market discipline, or, alternatively, could require more intrusive supervision, reducing the innovative market dynamics I mentioned earlier. If you see in these developments the seeds of Basel II--in their requirements for better risk-management systems and greater disclosure--you understand the objectives and approach of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The same factors are driving the proposal of the U.S. authorities to require the supervisory application of Basel II only to the largest, most complex banks, in which scale and scope imply that the necessity of continued investment in improved risk-management techniques and greater emphasis on disclosure are particularly appropriate. These factors are, I believe, also behind the suggestion of my colleague Chairman Powell, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that perhaps the United States ought to consider a different supervisory policy for smaller banks than for the complex entities. I cannot leave the subject of supervision without a brief comment on the trend to remove supervision from the responsibility of central banks and to create an overarching single supervisory authority for all financial institutions and markets. Such a structure may well be appropriate for the jurisdictions that have adopted such regulatory frameworks, given their history and institutional development. I certainly respect the decision of countries that have adopted the Financial Supervisory Authority model, and have thus excluded their central banks from the direct supervision and regulation of their banks. However, I believe that such a decision has the potential to undermine a central bank's ability to manage financial crises. At the outset of my remarks, I emphasized that financial market stability and efficiency do not require an absence of volatility and loss and indeed may require some degree of financial stress. But, my experience also suggests that at certain times--genuine crises, particularly those with a global dimension--the central bank must act to avert disaster. The history of the Federal Reserve in the last couple of decades suggests that central bank effectiveness requires that it have a deep and practical understanding of how banking works and, what is more, genuine credibility with bankers. This kind of understanding and credibility can only be gained by direct interactions with banks and bankers. In turn, such interactions, which develop the knowledge of institutions and markets that is needed for crisis management, can in my view be gained only by hands-on supervision of banking organizations. Indirect knowledge is simply not a substitute. In the United States, the Congress has recognized the relationship between supervision and crisis-management capability. In its most recent review of the banking law--the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act--the Congress gave the Federal Reserve umbrella supervisory authority for the new financial holding companies as well as preserving its authority for bank holding companies and for member banks chartered by the states. To continue to fulfill its central bank role as crisis manager, I believe the Federal Reserve must continue to have a deep, meaningful, and, most important, practical, understanding of the largest, most systemically important, banks operating in the United States, as well as an understanding of the markets in which they operate. I believe that it can do so, in its role as umbrella supervisor of banking organizations and direct supervisor of state chartered member banks, while respecting the prerogatives of the primary supervisors of banks and other holding company subsidiaries that are not under its direct supervisory authority. And, an important point given the U.S. institutional structure, such an approach continues to be consistent with a healthy dual banking system--in which banks chartered by the federal government and by the respective states exist and compete side-by-side. The value of the dual banking system has withstood the test of time. Crisis Management and Liquidity Assistance The global trends toward market finance, consolidation, and global integration has expanded the range of liquidity and other crisis scenarios that central banks may need to confront. The market turmoil in the autumn of 1998 and the extreme risk-aversion that pervaded credit markets in 2002 amid accounting scandals in the United States may suggest that major market disruptions are probably more likely today to originate from shocks to financial markets that are outside the banking sector. Of course, if such shocks and the attendant market stress appear to pose risks to a central bank's macroeconomic objectives, policymakers can make appropriate adjustments to the stance of monetary policy. In addition, if policymakers are particularly concerned about improbable but highly costly events, they might well wish to consider market stress in their monetary policy deliberations even when the modal forecasts for macroeconomic variables such as inflation and economic growth have not changed much. Central banks can also be a calming influence on markets in a crisis simply by standing ready, as I noted earlier, to provide liquidity assistance if necessary. Although shocks may originate in global debt and equity markets, they may well reverberate in the banking sector. For example, in 1998, banks were faced with a surge in loan demand from borrowers with reduced access to their usual market funding sources. Assistance from the central bank may involve expanding the liquidity of the entire financial system through open market operations, or it could entail direct loans through the discount window to meet the liquidity demands of specific institutions. On the latter point, I would note that the Federal Reserve has recently restructured its lending programs so that credit can be routinely provided to borrowers in sound condition at an above-market rate but with few other administrative criteria. These changes should help to make the discount window even more effective in a crisis. The trends toward consolidation and worldwide operations in the financial sector also raise some important practical questions of coordination among central banks in providing liquidity assistance should there be a situation that requires it. For example, there are basic questions regarding arrangements among central banks on matters of collateral--the types of collateral that are acceptable, details of cross-border pledging arrangements and so on. These seemingly simple questions are not always easy to answer in international settings, but central banks should be actively working to resolve these and other such issues that bear on their ability and preparedness to meet cross-border liquidity needs. Conclusion Central banks have a long history of working to foster efficiency and stability in the global financial system. That traditional role has become more complex over time as the institutional and market realities of the financial system have evolved. Fortunately, central banks are aware of these changes and have made great progress in appropriately adapting their approaches to the execution of monetary policy, supervision, and crisis management. In our evolving financial system, however, much remains to be done. I can assure you that, as public servants, central bankers will continue to pursue these matters vigorously.

Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies At the Institute of Internal Auditors Financial Services Conference, Arlington, Virginia May 19, 2004 Corporate Governance: Where Do We Go From Here? Introduction Good morning. Thank you for the invitation to speak to this Institute of Internal Auditors' Financial Services Conference. I understand by looking at the IIA's website that May marks the second annual global celebration of Internal Audit Awareness Month which gives you an opportunity to promote your profession within individual organizations and throughout the business community. Before becoming a Federal Reserve Governor, I was at various times the chief internal auditor and chief financial officer of a bank, so I understand and appreciate the work you perform. Today, I will share some of my views on effective corporate governance and risk management with a special focus on certain aspects of the current risk environment. I will also talk about the role of internal auditing in both the enterprise-wide risk-management environment and under the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's standards. Finally, I will mention a couple of specific areas where you can have an important role in assessing the adequacy of controls. Corporate Governance Events at some corporations over the past three years have called into question the effectiveness of operational, financial reporting, and compliance controls; corporate governance practices; and the professionalism of auditors. Governance issues have also been raised concerning securities underwriting, bank lending practices, mutual funds, and a major stock exchange. Revelations of significant corporate governance and accounting failures, with Parmalat and Shell serving as recent examples, demonstrate that these are serious concerns worldwide, not just here in the United States. Events at the international level have renewed the resolve of companies around the globe to implement high-quality corporate governance practices and accounting and disclosure standards, and for auditors to employ rigorous and sound auditing techniques. Internal Control Fundamentals and Enterprise Risk Management When we talk about corporate governance, we typically start at the top of the organization, with the board of directors and senior management, and work downward. We do this for good reason. The directors and senior management set the governance tone within organizations and lead the way. It's apparent that boards of directors and senior management have a very full plate these days. They must assess the quality of corporate governance within their organization and ensure that the firm has effective accounting practices, internal controls, and audit functions. They must respond to the new requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. They must establish more stringent anti-money-laundering programs and comply with the USA Patriot Act. Some large financial institutions must address issues relating to Basel II and the implementation work that needs to be done. Firms are considering how they can be more effective in managing the business risks they face, including the rise in operational risks due to increased homeland security issues and reliance on technology. And, of course, they must still find the time and resources to run their businesses profitably. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) Internal Control Integrated Framework is still the U.S. standard on internal controls. The COSO model serves as the basis for meeting the internal control assessment and reporting requirements for depository institutions laid out in section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA 112). This model is also broadly applicable to public companies in complying with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under COSO, directors have responsibility for overseeing internal control processes so that they can reasonably expect that their directives will be followed. Although directors are not expected to understand the nuances of every line of business or to oversee every transaction, they are responsible for setting the tone regarding their corporations' risk-taking and for establishing an effective monitoring program. The implication is that directors should be vigilant in maintaining a clear understanding of how COSO is being implemented in their organizations. Directors should also keep up with innovations in corporate governance. For example, directors should be aware that a new COSO framework has been proposed to encompass Enterprise Risk Management. A draft of the updated COSO framework was released for comment last summer, and a final document is expected later this year. For those of you not familiar with the new COSO framework, let me briefly explain that enterprise-wide risk management is a discipline that an organization can use to identify events that may affect its ability to achieve its strategic goals and to manage its activities consistent with its risk appetite. Such events include not only those that may result in adverse outcomes, but also those that give rise to opportunities. When embraced, an enterprise-wide risk management framework improves the quality and flow of information for decisionmakers and stakeholders, focuses attention on the achievement of organizational goals, and improves the overall governance of an organization. Some key steps in effective enterprise-wide risk management include identifying and assessing the key risks within an organization and determining the appropriate response to those risks. Companies should determine the level of risk they are willing to accept given the return they can achieve. Management then must implement effective processes to limit risk to the acceptable level. Once these steps have been taken, business line managers are expected to monitor actual risk levels and test the effectiveness of the risk responses. Several elements are essential to the successful implementation of enterprise-wide risk management. One is clearly articulated risk-management goals which provide a foundation for the enterprise-wide risk management program and for related training and communication. A second is a common risk language which is critical because it enables individuals throughout the organization to conduct meaningful cross-functional discussions about risk. A third essential element is that individuals clearly understand their roles in the risk-assessment and risk-management framework. In today's environment, all organizations should consider embracing this discipline. Indeed, the Federal Reserve is currently considering how enterprise-wide risk management can better be integrated into its management processes. Tone at the Top It is also important that a strong culture of compliance be established at the top of the organization and that a proper ethical tone be set for governing the conduct of business. In many instances, senior management must move from thinking about compliance as chiefly a cost center to considering the benefits of compliance in protecting against legal and reputational risks that can have an impact on the bottom line. The board and senior management are obligated to deliver a strong message to others in the firm about the importance of integrity, compliance with the law, fair treatment of customers, and overall good business ethics. Leaders should demonstrate their commitment through their individual conduct and their response to control failures. While the ethical tone of a financial institution comes from the top, a successful ethics program must be demonstrated by staff members at all levels and throughout the organization. The environment should empower any employee to elevate ethical or reputational concerns to appropriate levels of management without fear of retribution. In other words, the culture of the organization should permit issues to be raised to senior management; management can then demonstrate their commitment by responding appropriately. Role of Internal Audit This leads me to the importance of the role of the internal audit function within an organization. The Federal Reserve very much supports a strong, independent audit function at financial services companies. As indicated in our amended interagency policy statement released last year, the audit committee is responsible for providing an independent, objective, and professional internal audit process. The audit committee, in its oversight of the internal audit staff, should ensure that the function's consulting activities do not interfere or conflict with the objectivity it should have with respect to monitoring the institution's system of internal control. In order to maintain its independence, the internal audit function should not assume a business-line management role over control activities, such as approving or implementing operating policies or procedures, including those it helped design in connection with its consulting activities. To support this goal, the audit committee should ensure that internal audit has an effective quality assurance process. This becomes increasingly important as organizations grow in scale, enter new lines of business, become more complex, or acquire organizations with different cultures. As organizations grow, internal auditors must learn new technical skills, manage larger staffs, and be continually alert for emerging gaps or conflicts of interest in the system of internal controls. This often requires that the quality assurance process around the internal audit process become better defined and promptly alerts the general auditor and the audit committee to weaknesses in the internal audit program. Risk-focused audit programs should be reviewed regularly to ensure that audit resources are focused on the higher-risk areas as the company grows and products and processes change. As lower-risk areas come up for review, auditors should do enough analysis to be confident of their risk rating. Audit committees should receive reports on all breaks in internal controls in a form that will help them determine where the controls and the auditing process can be strengthened. Before a company moves into new or higher-risk areas, the board of directors and senior management should receive assurances from appropriate management and internal audit that the tools and metrics are in place to ensure adherence to the basics of sound governance. The audit committee should actively engage the internal auditor to ensure that the bank's risk assessment and control process are vigorous. Many of the organizations that have seen their reputations tarnished in the past few years have simply neglected to consider emerging conflicts of interest when adding new products and lines of business. It is important to make sure that appropriate firewalls and mitigating controls are in place before the product or activity begins. Some institutions seek to coordinate the internal audit function with several risk monitoring functions (for example, loan review, market risk assessment, and legal compliance departments) by establishing an administrative arrangement under one senior executive. Coordination of these other monitoring activities with the internal audit function can facilitate the reporting of material risk and control issues to the audit committee, increase the overall effectiveness of these monitoring functions, better use available resources, and enhance the institution's ability to comprehensively manage risk. But I want to add a word of caution. The internal audit function must remain independent of all control processes to be effective. In addition, when an auditor becomes part of the management process subject to internal audit review, the independent view is lost. Internal auditors are in the unique position to understand the evolution of all forms of risks and controls across the organization. If internal audit administratively reports to a chief risk officer, the relationship should be designed to avoid interfering with or hindering the manager of internal audit's direct functional reporting relationship to the audit committee. Also, the audit committee should ensure that efforts to coordinate these monitoring functions do not result in the manager of internal audit conducting control activities. Furthermore, the internal audit manager should have the ability to independently audit these other monitoring functions. I would also like to add that internal auditors are the eyes and ears of the audit committee around the organization. As the complexity of financial products and technology has grown, the financial services industry has increased its reliance on vendors and third-party service providers for a host of technological solutions. Be mindful that these outsourcing arrangements may pose additional types of risks for the organization, such as security or data privacy risks. Internal auditors should remain vigilant in identifying risks as the organization changes or new products are delivered to the marketplace. The Compliance Function I also want to mention that an integral part of enterprise-wide risk management is an enterprise-wide compliance program that looks at how activities in one area of the firm may affect the legal and reputational risks of other business lines and across the enterprise as a whole. It should consider how compliance with laws, regulations, and internal policies, procedures, and controls should be enhanced or changed in response. This approach is in marked contrast to the silo approach to compliance, which considers the legal and reputational risks of activities or business lines in isolation without considering how those risks interrelate and affect other business lines. With banking organizations offering a wider variety of products, the possibility of breaks in consumer, legal and regulatory compliance grows. A paradigm shift to an enterprise-wide compliance structure is an integral part of effective enterprise-wide risk management. While the compliance function will vary by the size and complexity of the organization, the compliance function should be independent of other functions in the organization, including the internal audit function. Compliance officers should have access to all operational areas. An independent compliance function can help identify compliance weaknesses that cross management lines of responsibilities and may not be effectively managed. In larger organizations, this may require both business-line and enterprise-wide compliance committees to prioritize resources. The internal audit function should perform independent reviews of the effectiveness of the compliance function. These reviews should examine the quality of information in compliance reports, the adequacy of training programs, whether deficiencies are promptly corrected, and how compliance risk management is implemented by product managers. The internal auditor can also assess whether sufficient resources are available to meet the changing needs of the organization. The U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board While we are discussing the importance of effective internal controls, let me point out that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) has recently approved Auditing Standard No. 2, An Audit of Internal Control over Financial Reporting Performed in Conjunction with an Audit of Financial Statements . The new standard is clearly an improvement over the previous one. It highlights the benefits of strong internal controls over financial reporting and furthers the objectives of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This standard requires external auditors of public companies to evaluate the process that management uses to prepare the company's financial statements. External auditors must gather evidence regarding the design and operations effectiveness of the company's internal controls and determine whether the evidence supports management's assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal controls. While the new standard allows external auditors to use the work of others, including that performed by internal auditors, it emphasizes that external auditors must perform enough of the testing themselves so that their own work provides the principal evidence for making a determination regarding the company's controls. Based on the work performed, the external auditor must render an opinion as to whether the company's internal control process is effective, which is a relatively high standard. In addition, as part of its overall assessment of internal controls, the external auditor is expected to evaluate the effectiveness of the audit committee. If the audit committee is deemed to be ineffective, the external auditor is required to report that assessment to the company's board of directors. This new standard will certainly put more demands on external auditors and public companies alike. But this is the price to be paid for "raising the bar" to achieve greater reliability in corporate financial statements and to regain the confidence of the public and the trust of financial markets. Operations Risk Since the mid-1990s, the concept of operations risk has received increasing attention in connection with the evolution of enterprise risk management. By "operations risk" I mean any risk that arises from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems or from external events. Examples of operations risk include employee fraud, failed information system conversions, mis-sent wires, and weaknesses in security procedures for protecting assets and information. In February 2003, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released a paper titled "Sound Practices for the Management and Supervision of Operational Risk" that outlines a set of broad principles that should govern the management of operational risk at depository institutions of all sizes. These principles will likely play a key role in shaping our ongoing supervisory efforts in the United States with regard to operations risk management. As with COSO's enterprise risk management framework, I encourage you to read the operations risk paper. Operations risk has always been a part of the financial services industry. But the increasing complexity of financial organizations, an increase in the number and variety of products and services they provide, the evolution of business processes (including substantially greater reliance on information technology and telecommunications), and changes in the ethical environment in which we live have all contributed to more observable exposures to this type of risk. Many of the community bank failures in recent years have been due to operations risks. In a few cases, dominant chief executives perpetrated fraud by manipulating the internal controls. In others, the management information systems necessary to monitor exposures in riskier lines of business were never built. As a result, other managers and the boards of directors did not have the information necessary to monitor and understand the growing risks inherent in what appeared to be profitable strategies. Operations risk was a primary focus of Y2K preparations a few years ago. Identification of critical computer-reliant systems and infrastructures gave us a much clearer understanding of the financial system's dependence on technology and of the complexities of managing operations risk. Once institutions understood the considerable business risks that would result if they could not serve customers, they moved the management of Y2K preparations out of the back office and onto the desks of product-line and senior managers--where it belonged. Moreover, it became clear that financial institutions needed to plan for the possibility that an external threat--a failure in the critical infrastructure or by a major service provider or material counterparty--might severely impact a financial institution's business operations. There was an increased understanding of the interdependencies across market participants and of how credit, liquidity, and operations risks at one organization could have a cascading impact on other financial institutions. Complex Structured Finance Transactions Let's turn our attention to a couple of important areas where internal auditors can have a critical role in assessing the adequacy of controls. Innovation has occurred in the development of complex structured finance transactions, which have received quite a bit of negative press of late. While we are all too aware that recent events have unfortunately highlighted the ways in which complex structured transactions can be used for improper or even fraudulent purposes, these transactions, when designed and used appropriately, can play an important role in financing businesses and mitigating various forms of financial risks. Although deal structures vary, complex structured finance transactions generally have some common characteristics. Perhaps the most important characteristic is that they may expose the financial institution to elevated levels of market, credit, operations, legal, or reputational risk. First, they typically result in a final product that is nonstandard and is structured to meet a customer's specific financial objectives. Second, they often involve professionals from multiple disciplines and may involve significant fees. Third, they may be associated with the creation or use of one or more special-purpose entities designed to address the customer's economic, legal, tax, or accounting objectives or the use of a combination of cash and derivatives products. Financial institutions may assume substantial risks when they engage in a complex structured finance transaction unless they have a full understanding of the economic substance and business purpose of the transaction. These risks are often difficult to quantify, but the result can be severe damage to the reputations of both the companies engaging in the transactions and their financial advisers--and, in turn, impaired public confidence in those institutions. These potential risks and the resulting damage are particularly severe when markets react through adverse changes in pricing for similarly structured transactions that are designed appropriately. Assessments of the appropriateness of a transaction for a client traditionally have required financial firms and advisers to determine if the transaction is consistent with the market sophistication, financial condition, and investment policies of the customer. Given recent events, it is appropriate to raise the bar for appropriateness assessments by taking into account the business purpose and economic substance of the transaction. When banking organizations provide advice on, arrange, or actively participate in complex structured finance transactions, they may assume legal and reputational risks if the end user enters into the transaction for improper purposes. Legal counsel to financial firms can help manage legal and reputational risk by taking an active role in the review of the customer's governance process for approving the transaction, of financial disclosures relating to the transaction, and of the customer's objectives for entering into the transaction. As in other operational areas, strong internal controls and risk-management procedures can help institutions effectively manage the risks associated with complex structured finance transactions. Here are some of the steps that financial institutions, with the assistance of counsel and other advisers, should take to establish such controls and procedures: Ensure that the institution's board of directors establishes the institution's overall appetite for risk (especially reputational and legal) and effectively communicates the board's risk tolerances throughout the organization. Implement firm-wide policies and procedures that provide for the consistent identification, evaluation, documentation, and management of all risks associated with complex structured finance transactions--in particular, the credit, reputational, and legal risks. Implement firm-wide policies and procedures that ensure that the financial institution obtains a thorough understanding of the business purposes and economic substance of those transactions identified as involving heightened legal or reputational risk and that those transactions are approved by appropriate senior management. Clearly define the framework for the approval of individual complex structured finance transactions as well as new complex structured finance product lines within the context of the firm's new-product approval process. The new-product policies for complex structured finance transactions should address the roles and responsibilities of all relevant parties and should require the approval of all relevant control areas that are independent of the profit center before the transaction is offered to customers. Finally, implement monitoring, risk-reporting, and compliance processes for creating, analyzing, offering, and marketing complex structured finance products. Subsequent to new-product approval, the firm should monitor new complex structured finance products to ensure that they are effectively incorporated into the firm's risk-control systems. Of course, these internal controls and risk-management processes need to be supported and enforced by a strong "tone at the top" and a firm-wide culture of compliance as mentioned earlier. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Finally, another area where your work on assessing controls can be very important is in reviewing the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL). Financial regulators want to encourage banking organizations to strengthen their processes and documentation associated with their determination of the adequacy of their ALLL. As you know, accounting standard setters recently questioned the methodology for loan loss reserves and proposed new guidance. The good news is that they now recognize that reaffirming existing guidance could address many of the questions raised. But the fact that loan loss reserve methodology is a recurring issue reflects the reality that concerns about how the ALLL is being estimated and its impact on earnings do arise from time to time. In general, these situations can be addressed through strengthened audit procedures rather than changes in accounting standards. Furthermore, management of financial institutions should be reminded to take the time to review the estimation procedures for determining their loan-loss reserves. Banking institutions should be applying an ALLL methodology that is well defined, consistently applied, and auditable. Institutions are required to maintain written documentation to support the amounts of the ALLL and the provision for loan and lease losses reported in the financial statements. This methodology should be validated periodically and should be modified to incorporate new events or findings as needed. Interagency supervisory guidance specifies that management, under the direction of the board of directors, should implement appropriate procedures and controls to ensure compliance with the institution's ALLL policies and procedures. Given that many banks use credit models, it is important that those models be validated periodically. Institutions should be vigilant to ensure the integrity of their credit-related data and that the loan review process provides the most up-to-date and accurate information possible for management to consider as part of its ALLL assessment. Conclusion I have touched on a number of important topics today. While some of them, such as structured finance transactions and loan loss reserve accounting, are rather specific, these risk issues cannot be viewed in isolation. I want to note that these are just aspects of the broader issues of corporate governance and enterprise-wide risk management. Successful risk management should be integrated into an organization's corporate governance processes, with appropriate controls, testing, and oversight. Boards of directors and senior management have the responsibility to establish effective risk-management and assessment processes across their organizations and to integrate the results of those efforts into their strategic and operating planning processes. Because of its unique, firm-wide perspective and its independence, the internal audit function can play an important role in reviewing the quality of corporate governance, internal control, and enterprise-wide risk management.

Remarks by Governor Edward M. Gramlich At the second meeting of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission, Washington, D.C. May 20, 2004 Workplace Financial Education The Federal Reserve System has a long history as a promoter and provider of consumer education. An increasingly complex global financial system requires consumers to have a strong working knowledge of financial concepts. To highlight the importance of financial education and to make people aware of the multitude of financial education resources that are available to them, the Federal Reserve System launched a national public campaign that began in May 2003. But before we launched a public campaign, we began putting together a serious program of workplace education for our own Board employees. In November 2002, we sponsored a roundtable with fifteen to twenty employers that we identified as having active workplace education programs. Attendees, representing Reserve Banks, private corporations, and government agencies, discussed goals, plans, and how to get started. This group suggested some key features that we built into our own program. One was to make financial education a lifetime responsibility, for us and our employees. Another was to keep information current, relevant, and responsive to changing conditions. A third was to provide information through a range of vehicles. From this session we gathered information on best practices and formed an internal task force to plan, coordinate, and evaluate these efforts. The task force developed ongoing objectives for the program that include increasing employees' understanding of how Board-sponsored benefit programs can contribute to short- and long-term financial well-being, improving employees' knowledge of basic financial concepts and improving their capability to make personal finance decisions, encouraging employees to adopt financial management behaviors that will help them increase their short- and long-term savings and better manage or eliminate debt, and evaluating the impact of workplace financial education on participation in Board benefit programs and financial behavior through appropriate metrics. To carry out our objectives, we use a variety of methods. We host lunch-time seminars, offer morning or afternoon programs, and place articles and educational materials on our internal electronic newsletter. We are also developing an internal web site designed to improve employees' knowledge of finance, benefits, health, and career development issues. Our programs and educational materials cover a variety of topics. "Making Sense of Your Credit Report" provides information on the factors that can positively or negatively affect a credit report. "College Savings: Making Education Your Financial Goal" discusses education as a financial goal and presents information on Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, U.S. Savings Bonds, and Qualified Tuition Programs as types of savings vehicles for achieving that goal. Programs on estate planning and retirement are offered, as well as seminars on financial planning and advanced investment. Many of these programs are geared to those employees who have been in the workforce for many years. However, understanding that many of our young people don't receive formal course work in financial matters, we designed a program that is more meaningful to new professionals. This program, which is designed for those young people just entering the workforce, discusses the importance of starting to save at a young age, homeownership, advanced education, and avoiding debt. Workplace education benefits both the employer and employee. For the employee, more knowledge, one hopes, will result in better financial decisions and overall financial well-being. Employees who are taking maximum advantage of the benefits available to them will more likely have greater job satisfaction, which may result in lower turnover. For the employer, research studies have shown that employees who are financially healthy are more productive. They are absent less often, spend less time at the workplace dealing with financial crises, and earn higher job performance ratings. We commend the Commission for recognizing workplace education as an integral component in formulating a national financial education strategy.

Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. 2004 Distinguished Alumni Award, Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C. May 22, 2004 Economics and Ethical Behaviors I am pleased to be here today and honored to accept the Sidwell Friends School Distinguished Alumni Award for 2004. It is awe-inspiring to be included in the company of so many accomplished graduates, including Walter Gilbert, Hanna Holborn Gray, Antonio Casas, Helen Colson, and Bill Nye. All of you, as Sidwell Friends graduates and friends, clearly understand the value of a good education. Indeed, economists have long noted an "education premium" in compensation, with college-educated workers earning approximately fifty percent more than workers with no more than a high school education. However, you also know that a good education is more than just the classroom-based learning of facts, or even the skill of critical thinking. A truly outstanding education also encourages moral behaviors and appropriate decisions. Sidwell Friends, with its grounding in Quaker traditions, certainly values the moral and ethical development of its students. Fortunately, many schools teach the importance of choosing the "hard right over the easy wrong." That is where I will focus my brief remarks. From my perspective as a policymaker, I want to commend the emphasis on a complete education, with technical, critical thinking, and ethical components, and encourage you and other schools to, if anything, redouble your efforts to instill moral values and ethical behaviors. Obviously, we as Sidwell graduates hope to exemplify those values as much as possible in our personal and professional dealings. Similarly, I encourage the current generation of students to take advantage of the moral and ethical training available at these schools. Do not forsake a solid grounding in those topics that will help you to do "good" while you are learning the skills required to do "well." Some of you may have noticed that I encouraged this focus on teaching and practicing ethical and cooperative behaviors as an economic policy maker. In that role, shouldn't I encourage you to be only a coolly self-centered, utility-maximizing, homo economicus ? The answer is no. Economic outcomes are improved when market participants "play by the rules." This fact has a strong grounding in economic theory and empirical research. In fact, you may be surprised to know that the economics profession, even with its hard-headed assumption of rational actors pursuing their own self interest, has for the last few decades also focused on the role of moral and cooperative behaviors in leading to better economic outcomes. As one major example, a recent Nobel Prize in economics was shared by George Akerloff, who in a classic paper in 1970 showed that a failure of markets arises when the seller does not share honest and complete information about the quality of a product, in his paper, used cars, with would-be buyers. Akerloff went on to show that such asymmetry in information and opportunistic behavior will ultimately drive honest dealings out of the market unless it is overcome by new institutional structures. Some of those structures arise from the private sector. As a policymaker, I see many of those structures arise in the form of regulation. In those markets in which there is a strong likelihood that self-policing behavior will not emerge, and opportunistic behavior is a real risk, the government must create regulation to protect the weaker or less-well-informed party from the stronger, better-informed one. These regulations are well intended and often have the desired outcome; however, in spite of the regulators' best efforts, they can be burdensome, and compliance with them may well consume resources that might go to providing more or better goods and services. This is not an argument against regulation; sound regulation is needed. It is an example of the cost imposed on society by the unscrupulous behaviors of a few. Not only have economists identified theoretical failures that come from unethical and opportunistic behaviors, social scientists have also demonstrated real world benefits from cooperative behaviors. For example, a study of engineers found that individual workers who are more generous with their time with other workers, and in turn frequently benefit from the help of others, are more productive and have higher social standing. More recently of course, the entire economy, that is to say all of us, have experienced the costs of unethical behaviors in a matter of great macroeconomic consequence. The recent accounting and governance scandals were sufficiently numerous and serious to generate widespread concern among investors about the reliability of financial reporting in general. These scandals were a notable factor behind the U.S. stock market slide in the spring and summer of 2002, amidst the cascade of scandals culminating with WorldCom's revelations in June that year. And concerns about corporate governance probably contributed, at least in some measure, to the heightened business caution and sharp fall-off in business investment during this period. Thus, although other, more important factors were also working to restrain real activity during this period, it seems likely that the scandals exacerbated an already weak economic situation. Just as opportunistic behavior by individuals calls forth regulations as a counterweight, so too these corporate governance scandals have called forth new laws and regulations, which were probably the proper response and required to restore confidence, but which have almost surely added to the cost of doing business. The negative effect from lapses in corporate governance at the macroeconomic level in the United States is a very visible example of the national costs of poor corporate governance. Social scientists have also found that at the level of the individual company poor corporate governance costs and good corporate governance pays, quite literally. Some researchers have found that investments in firms which engage in unethical behavior earn abnormally negative returns for prolonged periods (Long and Rao, 1995). Others find that firms that have better corporate governance also have higher stock market valuations, higher profitability and faster sales, and there is evidence that buying shares of firms that score high in corporate governance and selling shares in firms that do not yields abnormally positive returns (Gompers, Ishii and Metrick, 2003). All of this is true not just in the United States, but globally as well. At the macroeconomic level, the World Bank has identified corruption as the single greatest obstacle to economic and social development. The Bank states that "corruption undermines development by distorting the rule of law and weakening the institutional foundation on which economic growth depends." Fortunately, there is some evidence from studies of emerging markets that firm-level corporate governance matters more in countries with weak legal systems, and one can infer from this work that firms can partially compensate for ineffective legal systems by practicing ethical behavior. Let me close by saying that the economy of the United States depends greatly on an educated workforce. My own research demonstrates that our productivity boom of the last nine years requires a talented and flexible work force. Education, however, must be broadly defined to include moral and ethical behaviors and good decisionmaking. There is plenty of evidence that such behaviors pay an ample reward to the individuals who make them and, unfortunately, the absence of such behaviors extracts a cost, potentially from all of us. I am pleased to have attended a school that continues to value such an education, encourage all schools to emphasize such training, and am truly honored to accept this award from my fellow alumni.
