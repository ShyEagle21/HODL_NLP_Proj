Financial Services Policy Committee A Committee of the Conference of Presidents Federal Reserve System David Fettig FSPC Spokesman (612) 204-5274 Federal Reserve Banks Announce Changes to Increase Efficiency in Check Services as Shift from Check to Electronics Continues Minneapolis, Minn., Aug. 2, 2004--The Federal Reserve Banks today announced further changes to increase the efficiency of their check-processing operations while maintaining high-quality services to depository institutions throughout the country. Check processing operations at nine sites will be discontinued and the volumes at these sites shifted to other Federal Reserve locations. These changes will take place through 2005 and early 2006, and they respond to the nation's increasing substitution of electronic payments for paper checks. This announcement follows the Reserve Banks' June 16, 2004, announcement of a strategy to meet the evolving demands of the payments system. The Reserve Banks will continue providing check services to customers nationwide. However, by decreasing the number of check-processing locations and increasing capacity at other sites, the Reserve Banks will reduce their check service operating costs in line with the ongoing shift in consumer and business preferences for electronic payments. "These changes are intended to improve the efficiency of our check operations while maintaining high-quality check services to depository institutions nationwide," said Gary Stern, chairman of the Reserve Banks' Financial Services Policy Committee and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. "But streamlining our check infrastructure is only part of the Reserve Banks' strategy to improve efficiency; for example, we are also launching new products and services to support the implementation of the Check 21 Act in October 2004." As previously announced in early 2003, the Reserve Banks are also currently undergoing a restructuring of their check operations from 45 to 32 sites by the end of 2004. This new restructuring will reduce that number to 23 by early 2006. The implementation schedule for this new round of restructuring changes will be determined within the next several months. Also, as previously announced, the Reserve Banks will continue to review their check processing operations each year and undertake further restructurings as necessary. The new round of restructurings will mean the transfer of check operations as shown in the following table: Office where check operations will close Office where check operations will move Boston, Mass. Windsor Locks, Conn. Columbus, Ohio Cleveland, Ohio Birmingham, Ala. Atlanta, Ga. Nashville, Tenn. Atlanta, Ga. Detroit, Mich. Cleveland, Ohio Oklahoma City, Okla. Dallas, Texas Houston, Texas Dallas, Texas Portland, Ore. Seattle, Wash. Salt Lake City, Utah Denver, Colo. "As we've been saying for some time and as the financial services industry realizes, not only are fewer checks being written, but paper checks are increasingly giving way to electronic alternatives," said Stern. "While this makes for an increasingly efficient payments system, it also means that we must shift work among offices and, unfortunately, some dedicated staff will lose their jobs." As a result of these changes, the Reserve Banks will reduce their overall check staff on net by about 270, representing about 6 percent of their current check employees. In the offices where check processing will be eliminated, about 640 positions will be affected. Some staff reductions may occur through attrition and there may be some opportunities for reassignment. In addition, the Reserve Banks estimate that they will add about 370 positions at the offices that will continue processing checks. As with their current restructuring effort, the Reserve Banks will offer a variety of programs to affected staff, including separation packages, extended medical coverage and career transition assistance. In 2003, Reserve Banks' check volume declined at about a 5 percent rate. During 2004, check volumes have declined at an accelerated pace, and such declines are expected to continue in coming years. A 2001 Federal Reserve study revealed that about 42 billion checks were written in the United States in 2000, down from about 50 billion in 1995. The Reserve Banks will continue to assist the nation's financial services industry by conducting research related to the nation's payments system. The results of the most recent payments study will be available later this year. The Federal Reserve Banks' long-term check processing strategy will allow them to better meet the expectations of the 1980 Monetary Control Act. That act requires the Federal Reserve to set prices to recover, over the long run, its total operating costs of providing payment services to depository institutions, as well as the imputed costs it would have incurred and the imputed profits it would have expected to earn had the services been provided by a private business firm.

Remarks by Governor Edward M. Gramlich At the Retirement Research Consortium Annual Conference, Washington, D.C. August 12, 2004 Rules for Assessing Social Security Reform Just as the crocuses bloom and the robins sing every spring, the Social Security reformers come out of the woodwork in the year following a presidential election. For three years these reformers lie dormant, biding their time and fine-tuning their plans. It is not yet time, they caution. Let's wait until presidential politics are out of the way. This conference seems to be a first shot in the 2005 reform round, much like the first robin song of spring. I confess that in the past I have been a part of the reform campaign, though my efforts in 1997 were largely dictated by the advisory council I had chaired for the previous three years. As everybody knows, the 1997 round came to naught, as did the 2001 round, the 1993 round, the 1989 round, and the 1985 round. The odds are that the 2005 round will come to naught too, but hope springs eternal. In 1997 I advocated a plan that I still think is sound, and one that I still like better than any alternative I have seen. It contained some steps to tighten up the present system--most notably indexing the retirement age to overall life expectancy. One could buttress these steps, and add modestly to system progressivity, by changing the maximum taxable wage amount or by adjusting benefit bend points or marginal replacement rates. My plan also featured small-scale add-on individual accounts. I thought small-scale individual accounts would be viewed as a nice, moderate solution to the problem of generating new national saving and new saving for retirement, but in fact they were universally condemned. Basically, liberals seem to fear any new individual accounts, and conservatives don't like accounts that are too small. Small individual accounts can also be criticized as a costly way to raise saving. Were I playing this time around, I might compromise with political reality by foregoing the individual accounts. Low national saving is still a very important issue, but dealing with it through general fiscal policy would be more efficient. As for Social Security, perhaps we could just index the retirement age and take some other measures, of which there are many possibilities, to bring the system into actuarial balance. But that approach may not be universally appealing either, and I will probably sit out the 2005 round. Just like an aging player who turns to umpiring when he can no longer hit the fast ball, for this talk I am going to focus not on reform plans themselves but on the rules of the game. When liberals or conservatives fashion their reform plans this year, they ought to play by certain rules, and I want to list and defend those rules. Some of these rules are merely repeated from our 1997 advisory council report, and some I developed later in response to what I consider to be policymaking false advertising. 1. Stick to standard assumptions Many assumptions go into Social Security forecasts and reform plan forecasts. The trustees' report is the source of these assumptions, thirteen of which are important. For both economic and demographic assumptions, the trustees and their staffs, covering four government agencies, work with two outside trustees, as well as the actuaries for Social Security and Medicare, to review past information and to project sensible assumptions. From time-to-time technical panels have reviewed and assessed the trustees' assumptions. The trustee process has generally worked very well. It has been remarkably free of political influence, a considerable achievement in view of the stakes involved. Advisory councils and outside analysts alike have used the trustees' assumptions, and most of the ensuing arguments have involved the policies themselves, not the assumptions. These assumptions are sometimes controversial. In recent years the trustees have arguably used overly pessimistic productivity assumptions, which would tend to worsen the actuarial balance of the Social Security trust fund (SSTF), and overly pessimistic mortality assumptions, which would tend to improve the SSTF actuarial balance. In a deeper sense, it has not always been clear that the trustees' assumptions have come from a common theoretical framework. The process would certainly benefit from more concentrated attention on how the macroeconomy should be modeled in the long run. Questions that could be asked include whether the real wage assumptions are consistent with the real interest rate assumptions, whether the retirement assumptions are consistent with the mortality assumptions, and whether the population assumptions are consistent with the factor-augmenting productivity assumptions from a production function. The process will also benefit from the input of other agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office. Two sets of analyses are better than one, and the trustees' assumptions should be improved and refined over time with the added debate. At the same time, I would still argue that the trustees' assumptions, long the bedrock of Social Security forecasts, should continue to play a central role. The base case of all plans should be analyzed with the intermediate assumptions of the trustees. 2. Conduct proper stochastic simulations But base cases aren't everything. Even when the forecast period is only one or two years, economic forecasters should show alternative simulations. Social Security forecasters should certainly make alternative projections further into the future, an activity known as sensitivity analysis. In the past, the trustees have carried out optimistic and pessimistic simulations by varying all thirteen important assumptions up or down. Although better than nothing, this approach could give a misleading view of the stochastic uncertainty, because it is highly unlikely that all thirteen variables will go one way or the other. Statisticians have long known how to deal with such issues--they just estimate the full variance-covariance matrix and vary the assumptions probabilistically. Then they run a large number of Monte Carlo simulations and compute the sensitivity bands from that. One cannot literally do that with Social Security assumptions because the forecasts are appropriately not all taken from past data with computable standard errors. At the same time, the trustees do have lower and upper bounds on all assumptions, and the Monte Carlo methodology could be approximated. Indeed, I am pleased to see that the trustees are already taking steps in this direction. Most designers of reform plans have stuck to the base case in costing out their plans, but this convention should change as well. Some plans look better or worse in particular scenarios, some are actually structured to reduce true stochastic uncertainty for the whole system, and some increase stochastic uncertainty. It is important to know how various plans fare on this dimension. Hence, along with the stochastic simulations of the present system, we should also require stochastic simulations of alternative plans, to learn how the system would fare under different scenarios. 3. Conduct simulations for which the end point doesn't matter For years the trustees have assessed the long-run solvency of the program over a seventy-five-year period. Seventy-five years seems like a long time, but for Social Security purposes it may not be long enough. If trust fund inflows and outflows were roughly in balance beyond the seventy-five year horizon, a simulation of that length might be adequate for judging the long-run sustainability of the system. But in fact, the years beyond the horizon are ones of large imbalance. Hence, the seventy-five-year results give a misleadingly optimistic picture of SSTF finances. Not only that, but because each passing year brings a new high-deficit year into the forecast period, the passage of time alone with no forecast error moves the system into a deeper actuarial deficit. Were the Congress somehow to make changes that solved the seventy-five-year actuarial deficit, it would take only one year for the system to fall again into imbalance. Such a situation could cause political discomfort, to say the least. There are a number of ways to deal with this problem. Before 1965 the trustees determined the long-run solvency of the system by making calculations in perpetuity. This method was changed in 1965, partly because of the difficulty of making super long-run projections--say, projecting birth rates in 2450 (even though, because of discounting, those projections will not matter much). In our advisory council report we hit on the idea of requiring any reform plan to stabilize the trust fund ratio (trust fund balance over annual expenditures) in the eighth decade out. Such an approach avoids the end-point problem without using numbers beyond the seventy-five-year forecast horizon, though there could still be problems beyond the eighth decade. One could also factor in some measure of automaticity--say, having tax rates or retirement ages gradually adjust to trends in spending or taxes. We should still show flow results at various stages in the future, or cumulative results for subperiods, to prevent game-playing with time horizons. But when results are cumulated into the present payroll tax change that would cover all future deficits, or other such magnitudes, let's make this calculation independent of end points. And let's eliminate the situation in which the passage of time alone, with no forecast error, can change the actuarial balance of the SSTF. 4. Integrate disability insurance Social Security is really two programs--a program for old-age and survivor assistance and a program for the disabled. The disabled do not get analyzed much, but they are surprisingly important--at latest count numbering 18 percent of benefit recipients. Benefits for the disabled are computed within the overall Social Security benefit formula. Essentially, instead of averaging earnings over the high thirty-five-year career earnings, the averaging takes place for the time of the worker's disability back to age twenty-one. This means that when reformers alter retirement ages, bend points, or marginal replacement rates, disabled workers are more or less dealt with in a proportionate manner, though some reformers have introduced special adjustments. But disabled workers would not necessarily be dealt with in a proportionate manner by changes that convert normal payroll contributions to individual accounts, for the simple reason that the workers lose years in which to build up their accounts. Compensatory adjustments can, of course, be made. My only point is that adjustments ought to be made, or at least considered, to integrate disabled workers. Plans that convert to individual accounts should not get a free ride because they ignore the disabled. 5. Require reform plans to be internally financed So far most of my strictures could be taken right out of a statistics book, or from the report of the advisory council that I chaired. I will now get a little more controversial. One development that does make it difficult to choose among competing Social Security plans is that analysts have begun assuming fiscal transfers. Such transfers can obviously improve the attractiveness of the present system or of reform plans. For example, the present system could be preserved simply by transfers from the non-Social Security part of the federal budget. Alternatively, workers could be allowed to divert their tax contributions into individual accounts and make up the difference with budgetary transfers. Our advisory council did not recommend any such transfers, but many subsequent plans have. Let's stop the practice and require all plans to be internally financed. This seems the only fair way to compare plans. I argued this point a few years ago when federal surpluses were projected and many of those who hold overall views about Social Security similar to mine were proposing fiscal transfers. That time seems long ago. Now that we have budget deficits as far as the eye can see and deficits that are large and getting larger, my case for fiscal abstinence should be much stronger. This stricture would not abolish plans with transition costs--it would require only that any taxes or benefit cuts needed to fund the transition should be explicitly identified and assessed. I would even extend the stricture to prevent loans of general revenues that might be paid back late in the transition period because we have no guarantee that these loans will in fact be paid back and because the possibilities for false advertising are too great. Even if, by some miracle, the general government budget comes back into something approaching balance, I would still argue my case on the grounds of an even-handed comparison. Perhaps the political imperatives won't be as strong then, but I still cannot find a strong reason why Social Security reform should not be internally financed. 6. Do not incorporate an equity premium Many Social Security reform plans involve investing in equities, either publicly by the SSTF or privately through individual accounts. There are sound reasons for such investments, and I make no criticism of the investments themselves. But let's score the investments fairly. It is true that for very long past periods stocks have outperformed bonds. But stocks have not outperformed bonds for every decade within these long periods, and decades are relevant for analyses of individual accounts. Over the future, every canon of modern-day finance, indeed every canon of traditional finance, suggests that prospective risk-adjusted rates of return should be the same on stocks and bonds. So, plan reformers, invest in equities if you wish, but claim the same risk-adjusted rate of return for stocks and bonds. Claiming higher returns on system or individual portfolios invested in equities is legitimate only if the simulation also factors in the greater investment risk. Overall system finances should not benefit from portfolio shifts. Assessment The first four of these scoring suggestions should not be controversial and should certainly be feasible with modern analytical techniques. The last two may be more controversial, but they strike me as the only fair way to make comparisons across plans. All these suggestions are consistent with reform, even dramatic reform. My main point is that we should analyze different reform plans from a common statistical basis, making common assumptions and fair comparisons, aware of all the benefits and costs.

Release Date: August 24, 2004 For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced the issuance of a consent Notice of Prohibition against Charles Kushner, an institution-affiliated party of The NorCrown Trust, an unregistered bank holding company that owns or controls the shares of the NorCrown Bank, Livingston, New Jersey, a state nonmember bank. A Notice of Prohibition is issued under a provision of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act that authorizes the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators to limit the activities of bank officials who have been charged with criminal offenses pending the resolution of the charges. The Board's action against Mr. Kushner has been coordinated with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey. A copy of the Notice of Prohibition is attached.
Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency For Immediate Release August 26, 2004 Banking Agencies Issue Host State Loan-to-Deposit Ratios The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency today issued the host state loan-to-deposit ratios that the banking agencies will use to determine compliance with section 109 of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. These ratios update data released on May 22, 2003. In general, section 109 prohibits a bank from establishing or acquiring a branch or branches outside of its home state primarily for the purpose of deposit production. Section 109 also prohibits branches of banks controlled by out-of-state bank holding companies from operating primarily for the purpose of deposit production. Section 109 provides a process to test compliance with the statutory requirements. The first step in the process involves a loan-to-deposit ratio screen that compares a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio to the host state loan-to-deposit ratio for banks in a particular state. A second step is conducted if a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio is less than one-half of the published ratio for that state or if data are not available at the bank to conduct the first step. The second step requires the appropriate banking agency to determine whether the bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank's interstate branches. A bank that fails both steps is in violation of section 109 and is subject to sanctions by the appropriate banking agency. The updated host state loan-to-deposit ratios are attached. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency today issued the host state loan-to-deposit ratios that the banking agencies will use to determine compliance with section 109 of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan At a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming August 27, 2004 Opening Remarks I am pleased to be here this morning to discuss the economic implications of population aging and to provide a general overview of some of the issues that will be covered in much greater detail over the next two days. The so-called elderly dependency ratio--the ratio of older adults to younger adults--has been rising in the industrialized world for at least 150 years. The pace of increase slowed greatly with the birth of the baby-boom generation after World War II. But elderly dependency will almost certainly rise more rapidly as that generation reaches retirement age. The changes projected for the United States are not as dramatic as those projected for other areas--particularly Europe and Japan--but they nonetheless present substantial challenges. The growth rate of the working-age population in the United States is anticipated to slow from about 1 percent per year today to about 1/4 percent per year by 2035. At the same time, the percentage of the population that is over 65 is poised to rise markedly--from about 12 percent today to perhaps 20 percent by 2035. These anticipated changes in the age structure of the population and workforces of developed countries are largely a consequence of the decline in fertility that occurred after the birth of the baby-boom generation. The fertility rate in the United States, after peaking in 1957 at about 3-1/2 births over a woman's lifetime, fell to less than 2 by the early 1970s and then rose to about 2.1 by 1990. Since then, the fertility rate has remained close to 2.1, the so-called replacement rate--that is, the level of the fertility rate required to hold the population constant in the absence of immigration or changes in longevity. Fertility rates in Europe, on the whole, and in Japan have fallen far short of the replacement rate. The decrease in the number of children per family since the end of the baby boom, coupled with increases in life expectancy, has inevitably led to a projected increase in the ratio of elderly to working-age population throughout the developed world. The populations in most developing countries likewise are expected to have a rising median age but to remain significantly younger and doubtless will grow faster than the populations of the developed countries over the foreseeable future. Eventually, declines in fertility rates and increases in longevity may lead to similar issues with aging populations in what is currently the developing world but likely only well after the demographic transition in the United States and other developed nations. * * * The aging of the population in the United States will significantly affect our fiscal situation. Most observers expect Social Security, under existing law, to be in chronic deficit over the long haul; however, the program is largely defined benefit, and so the scale of the necessary adjustments is limited. The shortfalls in the Medicare program, however, will almost surely be much larger and much more difficult to eliminate. Medicare faces financial pressure not only from the changing composition of the population but also from continually increased per recipient demand for medical services. The combination of rapidly advancing medical technologies and our current system of subsidized third-party payments suggests continued rapid growth in demand, though future Medicare costs are admittedly very difficult to forecast. Although the sustainability of fiscal initiatives is generally evaluated for convenience in financial terms, sustainability rests, at root, on the level of real resources available to an economy. The resources available to fund the sum of future retirement benefits and the real incomes of the employed will depend, of course, on the growth rate of labor employed plus the growth rate of the productivity of that labor. The growth rate of the U.S. working-age population is expected to decline substantially over the next two decades and to remain low thereafter. But the fraction of that population that is employed will almost surely be affected by changes in the economic returns to working and, especially for older workers, improvements in health. Americans are not only living longer but also generally living healthier. Rates of disability for those over 65 years of age have been declining even as the average age of the above-65 population is increasing. This decline in disability rates reflects both improvements in health and changes in technology that accommodate the physical impairments associated with aging. In addition, work is becoming less physically strenuous but more demanding intellectually, continuing a century-long trend toward a more-conceptual and less-physical economic output. For example, in 1900, agricultural and manual laborers composed about three-quarters of the workforce. By 1950, those types of workers accounted for one-half of the workforce, and though still critical to a significant part of our economic value-added, today compose only about one-quarter of our workforce. To date, however, despite the improving feasibility of work at older ages, Americans have been retiring at younger ages. But rising pressures on retirement incomes and a growing scarcity of experienced labor could eventually reverse that trend. Of course, immigration, if we choose to expand it, could also lessen the decline of labor force growth in the United States. As the influx of foreign workers that occurred in response to the tight labor markets of the 1990s demonstrated, U.S. immigration does respond to evolving economic conditions. But to fully offset the effects of the decline in fertility, immigration would have to be much larger than almost all current projections assume. * * * It is thus heightened growth of output per worker that offers the greatest potential for boosting U.S. gross domestic product to a level that would enable future retirees to maintain their expected standard of living without unduly burdening future workers. Productivity gains in the United States have been exceptional in recent years. But, for a country already on the cutting edge of technology to maintain this pace for a protracted period into the future would be without modern precedent. One policy that could enhance the odds of sustaining high levels of productivity growth is to engage in a long overdue upgrading of primary and secondary school education in the United States. We obviously cannot attribute recent productivity trends to a high level of national saving. Rather, the effectiveness with which we have invested both domestic saving and funds attracted from abroad is the apparent source of our decade-long rise in productivity growth. As I have noted previously, the bipartisan policies of recent decades directed at deregulation and increasing globalization and the innovation that those policies have spurred have markedly improved our ability to channel saving to its most productive uses, and as a byproduct increased the flexibility and the resiliency of the U.S. economy. It is, of course, difficult to separate rates of return based on the innovations embedded in new equipment from the enhanced returns made available by productive ideas of how to rearrange existing facilities. From an accounting perspective, efficiency gains, broadly defined as multifactor productivity, have accounted for roughly half the growth in labor productivity in recent years. Capital deepening accounts for most of the remainder. All else being equal, domestic investment would raise future labor productivity and thereby help provide for our aging population. But the incremental benefit of additional investment may itself be affected by aging. With slowed labor force growth, the amount of new equipment that can be used productively could be more limited, and the return to capital investment could decline as a consequence. Yet it is possible that the return to certain types of capital--particularly those embodying new labor-saving technologies--could increase. Although domestic investment has accounted for only half our recent productivity gains, its contribution has historically been much larger. Should the pace of efficiency gains slow, it would fall to the level of investment to again become the major contributor to productivity gains. Investment, however, cannot occur without saving. But maintaining even a lower rate of capital investment growth will likely require an increased rate of domestic saving because it is difficult to imagine that we can continue indefinitely to borrow saving from abroad at a rate equivalent to 5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. A key component of domestic saving in the United States in future decades will be the path of the personal saving rate. That rate will depend on a number of factors, especially the behavior of the members of the baby-boom cohort during their retirement years. Over the post-World War II period, the elderly in the United States, contrary to conventional wisdom, seem to have drawn down their accumulated wealth only modestly. Apparently retirees spend at a lesser rate and save more than is implicit in the notion that savings are built up during the working years to meet retirement needs. Perhaps, people mis-estimate longevity or desire a large cushion of precautionary savings. Moreover, often people bequeath a significant proportion of their savings to their children or others rather than spend it during retirement. If the baby-boom generation continues this pattern, achieving a higher private domestic saving rate is not out of reach. Even so, critical to national saving will be the level of government, specifically federal government, saving. * * * A doubling of the over-65 population by 2035 will substantially augment unified budget deficits and, accordingly, reduce federal saving unless actions are taken. But how these deficit trends are addressed can have profound economic effects. For example, aside from suppressing economic growth and the tax base, financing expected future shortfalls in entitlement trust funds solely through increased payroll taxes would likely exacerbate the problem of reductions in labor supply by diminishing the returns to work. By contrast, policies promoting longer working life could ameliorate some of the potential demographic stresses. Changes to the age for receiving full retirement benefits or initiatives to slow the growth of Medicare spending could affect retirement decisions, the size of the labor force, and saving behavior. In choosing among the various tax and spending options, policymakers will need to pay careful attention to the likely economic effects. * * * The relative aging of the population is bound to bring with it many changes to the economy of the United States--some foreseeable, many probably not. Inevitably it will again require making difficult policy choices to balance competing claims. The decade-long acceleration in productivity and economic growth has seemingly muted the necessity of making such choices. But, as I noted earlier, history discourages the notion that the pace of growth will continue to increase. Though the challenges of prospective increasingly stark choices for the United States seem great, the necessary adjustments will likely be smaller than those required in most other developed countries. But how and when we adjust will also matter. Early initiatives to address the economic effects of baby-boom retirements could smooth the transition to a new balance between workers and retirees. As a nation, we owe it to our retirees to promise only the benefits that can be delivered. If we have promised more than our economy has the ability to deliver to retirees without unduly diminishing real income gains of workers, as I fear we may have, we must recalibrate our public programs so that pending retirees have time to adjust through other channels. If we delay, the adjustments could be abrupt and painful. Because curbing benefits once bestowed has proved so difficult in the past, fiscal policymakers must be especially vigilant to create new benefits only when their sustainability under the most adverse projections is virtually ensured. * * * Responding to the pending dramatic rise in dependency ratios will be exceptionally challenging for the policymakers in developed countries. While I do not underestimate the difficulties that we face in the United States, I believe that, given the political will, we are better positioned than most others to make the necessary adjustments. Aside from the comparatively lesser depth of required adjustment, our open labor markets should respond more easily to the changing needs and abilities of our population; our capital markets should allow for the creation and rapid adoption of new labor-saving technologies, and our open society should be receptive to immigrants. These supports should help us adjust to the inexorabilities of an aging population. Nonetheless, tough policy choices lie ahead. Footnotes The fertility rate used here is the total fertility rate. It is measured as the average number of children who would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she experienced the birth rates by age observed in any given year.
Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Comptroller of the Currency For Immediate Release August 31, 2004 Banking Agencies Announce 2005 Implementation for Web-Based Central Data Repository for Bank Financial Data The federal banking agencies announced today that they will target implementation of the Central Data Repository (CDR) for one of the first two Call Report periods of 2005. A specific date will be announced by the end of the year. Originally scheduled for implementation in October 2004, the system's start date was postponed last month to address industry feedback and to allow more time for testing and enrollment. The decision to delay implementation beyond 2004 was made to ensure that rollout of the new system would not increase burden for those bankers with additional reporting requirements at the end of the year. The agencies and industry focus groups are currently evaluating the schedule and will post detailed information and a new timeline on the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC) Web site, , later this year. In the meantime, banks will continue filing their Call Report data in the same manner they do today and the agencies will continue to process Call Report data using their existing processing systems. The agencies are currently considering Call Report changes that may be introduced in 2005.
