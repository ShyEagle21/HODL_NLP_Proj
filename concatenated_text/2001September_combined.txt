Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. At the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania September 4, 2001 The Evolving Financial and Payment System I am pleased to be with you this evening and I would like to thank Tony Santomero for inviting me to share a few thoughts with you about my recent work on financial sector consolidation and payment system issues. Changes in technology, business needs, and regulation are affecting both of these areas in important ways, and in some cases with highly visible results. Deregulation of the U.S. financial industry over the past ten years has helped to support dynamic and creative financial markets. During the same time, accelerating changes in technology have created new financial products and services as well as whole new ways of conducting financial business. Outside the United States, similar forces have been at work, although the details depend on the particular country or region. One of the largest recent changes has been the introduction of the euro and its effects on the structure of financial markets in Europe. The next step in this process will be taken next January when euro notes and coins will be put into circulation. In both the United States and overseas, there also have been a significant number of bank mergers, some of them very large, arising from these changing financial industry dynamics. G-10 Study of Financial Sector Consolidation Against this background of ongoing change in financial structure, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Ten countries commissioned a major study of the possible effects of financial consolidation. I was asked to oversee that study, whose key findings were published last January and covered thirteen developed countries, including the United States. The study documented the high levels of mergers and acquisitions among financial firms during the 1990s, including a noticeable acceleration during the last three years of the decade. Most of the consolidation was within countries and within segments of the financial sector. Cross-border or cross-sector consolidations have so far been less frequent. The data we collected suggested a number of conclusions. For example, financial consolidation has concentrated payment and settlement flows among fewer parties. The risk implications of this consolidation deserve close monitoring. In addition, the study found that although consolidation has some potential to improve the operating efficiency of the combined financial institutions and has done so in some cases, the overall evidence in favor of efficiency gains is weak. The study also found that the effects of consolidation on competition and credit flows are very case specific and depend on the nature of the markets for specific products and services. While the study found that financial consolidation has not significantly affected either the conduct or the effectiveness of monetary policy, we also concluded that central banks should remain alert to how future consolidation may affect the competitiveness of the markets that are most important to monetary policy. Central banks should also monitor potential future changes in the transmission mechanisms for monetary policy. Finally, the study concluded that existing policies appear adequate to address risks to the individual firm and systemic risks now and over the intermediate term. Looking ahead, however, the study identified a number of areas that deserve careful attention by policymakers. For example, enhanced contingency planning could reduce systemic risk should a large and complex financial institution become seriously distressed. Because no institution is too big to fail, I believe that regulators should also develop a clearer understanding of key factors such as the administration of bankruptcy laws and conventions across borders; the coordination of supervisory policies within and across borders; the treatment of over-the-counter derivatives, foreign exchange, and other financial market activities in distress situations; the roles and responsibilities of managers and boards of directors; and the administration of the lender-of-last resort function. Our study also helped clarify the need for international attention to contingency planning. In general, both crisis prevention and crisis management would improve with additional communication and cooperation among financial supervisors domestically and among central banks, finance ministries, and other financial supervisors internationally. Evolution of the Payment System and Strategies for Further Change Payment systems, especially retail payment systems, have also been evolving over time, although not dramatically. Unlike the households of ten or twenty years ago, however, households now frequently receive wages and salaries electronically and buy goods and services using credit or debit cards. The past few years have seen varied levels of development, both here and abroad, of new card-based and software-based payment instruments and systems, such as electronic money and Internet payment systems. Yet cash and checks remain the mainstays of retail commerce in the United States; this is a testament to the broad convenience of these instruments, developed over a long period, and the public's confidence in them. But the payment system is continuing to evolve. At some point, it is likely that the use of checks will start to decline, as it has in several other developed countries. One factor involved in this change is the increasing use of debit cards as a substitute for some check payments, especially those made at a merchant's point of sale, or POS. In some countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, this substitution has progressed substantially, and consumers now use debit cards widely. In the United States, we have seen the use of debit cards grow strongly over the past few years, fueled by the use of signature-based cards developed by the credit card networks. Another recent development is the increasing adoption of programs to "convert" or "electronify" checks at the point of sale. These programs typically use a check, or information from a check, to generate an electronic payment from the consumer to the merchant that is cleared through the automated clearinghouse (ACH) or electronic funds transfer (EFT) networks. In a sense, these programs turn a check into a disposable debit card. This analogy raises the question of what we can learn from the use of checks to initiate electronic payments and whether these programs are simply a transition stage to a more extensive electronic payment system. I believe these programs continue to deserve monitoring as we go forward. This evening I would also like to mention an old debate about the merits of check truncation, a debate that goes back at least to the late 1960s and early 1970s, when many observers of the payment system first began predicting the quick rise of a cashless and checkless society. In the past, the banking industry and the Federal Reserve have studied suggestions for the widespread truncation of checks at the bank of first deposit or at an intermediary bank to reduce the costs of the check-collection system. The results of these studies have been sensitive to assumptions about technology, transition costs, implementation timing, discount rates, and other factors. In addition, assumptions about the storage and retrieval of truncated checks or their images can affect an analysis. Most fundamentally, the degree to which banks and the public accept truncation and the associated electronic presentment of checks significantly affects the banking industry's ability to achieve economies of scale and standardization throughout a truncation and electronic collection system. Historically, sensitivity to these key assumptions has injected uncertainty into the business case for check truncation and electronic collection. As a result, the banking industry has faced difficult decisions about whether to invest in the truncation of checks or to invest in fully electronic payment technologies, such as the ACH or card networks, while encouraging their customers to initiate electronic payments from the beginning of a payment process. To date, the industry has done some of both, with business strategies varying across banking organizations. With recent declines in technology costs and increasing consumer acceptance of check truncation, however, some banks have accelerated their efforts to truncate checks. The Federal Reserve Banks now electronically present more than 20 percent of the checks they collect, of which one in four are also truncated at the Fed. Several banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks, are also building data archives in which to store digital images of checks to replace microfilm technologies and to provide mechanisms to process images of truncated checks. Some commercial banks also believe that greater automation of check data within their organizations, along with other customer information, can significantly speed and improve the overall quality of their customer service. These banks tend to see check truncation, electronic presentment, and check imaging as parts of a larger business strategy linked to automation, not simply as stand-alone, back-office operations. Other banks tend to analyze these automation steps more narrowly as tools to reduce back-office costs, and they remain somewhat skeptical about the business case for truncation and related activities. Payments System Development Committee I would like to turn now to the Payments System Development Committee, which is working with the private sector to better understand the issues arising from the evolution of the retail payment system. The committee, which I co-chair with Cathy Minehan, President of the Boston Fed, was established by the Federal Reserve Board in mid-1999 to (a) identify strategies for enhancing the long-term efficiency of the retail payment system, (b) identify barriers to innovation and work to reduce or eliminate those barriers when doing so is in the public interest, (c) monitor market developments, and (d) conduct workshops and forums for focused discussions about the payment system with the private sector. One of the committee's key projects during the past year has involved working with the public and private sector on a long-run strategy for facilitating the market adoption of check truncation and greater electronic check processing when this makes economic sense. The basic idea is that if a bank believes that truncating some or all of the checks it receives makes business sense, it should be able to do so without worrying about demands by other parties that the original check must be located and presented. When such demands are made, a legally sanctioned paper copy of the original could be provided in place of the original. A federal statute would provide the legal framework within which such a paper copy--or substitute check--would be produced, along with safeguards against paying the same check twice and other potential problems. The market theory of this approach is that by facilitating the use of substitute paper checks when a paper check is preferred, larger investments in truncation and electronic presentment may become economical over the longer term. In short, through this approach, the demand of some for paper checks will carry less weight in the business decisions of the many. Moreover, those who want a paper check will be able to obtain it with a minimum of inconvenience. With more electronic infrastructure, however, check collections potentially will be faster and cheaper, and customer-banking platforms within commercial banks may become more technologically integrated. In the end, the goals are to reduce the social cost of the payment system and to improve the technical foundation for providing financial services. The Payments System Development Committee also is working on various legal and regulatory issues, standards, and the future of clearing and settlement. In the regulatory area, for example, the committee has encouraged the Board's staff to revise the commentary to Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to reduce residual barriers to electronic innovations. Revisions last March helped clarify the legal status of the various "check conversion" projects that I noted earlier. In the standards area, we are closely following the work being done under the aegis of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) on standards that would support the use of substitute checks within the context of both bilateral and multilateral industry efforts to pursue check truncation. In addition, this past June, the committee held a one-day workshop on the implications of XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language) for the payment system. This workshop, held at the Boston Fed, involved a variety of representatives from both the private and public sectors. The workshop's major purpose was to provide the committee with a number of different views on the significance of XML for the payment system and the possibility of adopting a widely shared and flexible computer language for exchanging electronic payment messages and related information. Those discussions and other information suggest that XML is becoming increasingly important in the financial markets and that it raises interesting possibilities for the future. In the clearing and settlement area, the committee is discussing how new technology and business needs will interact to affect the design and functions of clearing and settlement systems in the future. Some have observed that in the long run, new technologies, along with the needs of e-business, will lead to important changes in clearing and settlement systems. In addition, the use of new technologies to conduct traditional payment system operations in more efficient and effective ways will also drive change. Both banks and end-users of the payment system are now discussing many issues and ideas. The committee has asked a group of staff to conduct further discussions with interested organizations and bring back to the committee a broader view of the current debate in this area. Finally, the committee is continuing to encourage survey research on the use of different payment systems. The Federal Reserve's Retail Payment Office is currently sponsoring several surveys to obtain more accurate data on both electronic and check payments being made in the United States. It is particularly important that we have a better idea of how many checks are being written in order for the banking industry and the public to understand better and plan for the evolution of the payment system. The technical work of "cleaning the numbers" collected in the surveys is continuing, and we hope to publish data from the survey later in the year. Conclusion In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that our financial system is continuing to evolve, as it must in a dynamic and competitive market economy. Financial consolidation at the national level has occurred relatively quickly, although much less so at the level of individual banking markets. The recent G-10 study did not find fundamental problems with developments to date. It did, however, outline some practical steps the authorities can take to help better manage potential risk to the financial system and outlined a number of areas that should be monitored and analyzed further over the longer term. Overall, the U.S. payment system continues to evolve slowly, but there have been steady changes and a great deal of experimentation over the past few years. Although we are not likely to see paper payment instruments disappear, electronic payment systems are being used more widely and creatively than in the past. On-line banking and other services are giving bank customers new and convenient mechanisms to initiate and receive electronic payments. However, simple ideas such as electronic bill payment by consumers and businesses have turned out to be more of a challenge than we imagined a few years ago. In addition, as the market continues to experiment with new systems, the old themes of reliability, security, privacy, and confidence need to be repeated often. Speaking as a member of the Payments System Development Committee, I would also like to emphasize the willingness of the committee members and the Fed staff to discuss with private-sector organizations their new ideas, insights, and views about the future of the payment system. I have found that our discussions so far have all been very productive in helping to broaden our thinking and to identify concrete steps that can be taken to improve the payment system. Thank you for your attention.

For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board today announced the approval of the application of Abbey National Treasury Services plc, London, England, to establish a branch in Stamford, Connecticut. Attached is the Order relating to this action.
Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan The condition of the financial markets Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate September 20, 2001 I would like to begin my remarks this morning by noting how deeply saddened I and my Federal Reserve colleagues are that so many talented and productive people from so many walks of life were lost or irreparably harmed last week. Although we are here today to discuss some of the immediate economic and financial implications of that tragedy, we are all too aware that the topic we discuss will be a mere footnote. The terrorism of September 11 will, doubtless, have significant effects on the U.S. economy over the short term. An enormous effort will be required on the part of many to cope with the human and physical destruction. But as we struggle to make sense of our profound loss and its immediate consequences for the economy, we must not lose sight of our longer-run prospects, which have not been significantly diminished by these terrible events. Over the past couple of decades, the American economy has become increasingly resilient to shocks. Deregulated financial markets, far more flexible labor markets, and, more recently, the major advances in information technology have enhanced our ability to absorb disruptions and recover. In the past, our economy has quickly regained its previous levels following the devastation of hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and myriad other natural disasters that periodically batter various regions of our country. Although the trauma of September 11 shares some characteristics with such disruptions, the differences are important. In contrast to natural disasters, last week's events are of far greater concern because they strike at the roots of our free society, one aspect of which is our market-driven economy. All modern economies require the confidence that free-market institutions are firmly in place and that commitments made today by market participants will be honored not only tomorrow, but for years into the future. The greater the degree of confidence in the state of future markets, the greater the level of long-term investment. The shock of September 11, by markedly raising the degree of uncertainty about the future, has the potential to result, for a time, in a pronounced disengagement from future commitments. And that, in the short run, would imply a lessened current level of activity. Indeed, much economic activity ground to a halt last week. But the foundations of our free society remain sound, and I am confident that we will recover and prosper as we have in the past. As a consequence of the spontaneous and almost universal support that we received from around the world, an agreement on a new round of multilateral trade negotiations now seems more feasible. Such an outcome would lead to a stronger global market system. A successful round would not only significantly enhance world economic growth but also answer terrorism with a firm reaffirmation of our commitment to open and free societies. But before the recovery process gets under way, stability will need to be restored to the American economy and to others around the world. Arguably, that stability was only barely becoming evident in the United States in the period immediately preceding the acts of terrorism. Aggregate measures of production, employment, and business spending continued to be weak. That said, consumer spending moved higher in August and appeared to be reasonably well maintained in the first part of September. Industry analysts suggest that motor vehicle sales were running close to August levels, and chain store sales were only modestly lower. Purchasing managers had noted an improvement in the orders picture in August. Moreover, the dramatic rate of decline in profits was slowing. To be sure, these signs were tentative but, on the whole, encouraging. During the past week, of course, the level of activity has declined. The shock is most evident in consumer markets where many potential purchasers stayed riveted to their televisions and away from shopping malls. Both motor vehicle sales and sales at major chain stores, some of our most current information on consumer spending, appear to have fallen off noticeably. And, the airline and travel industries have suffered severe cutbacks. The unprecedented shutdown of American air travel and tightened border restrictions have induced dramatic curtailments of production at some establishments with tight just-in-time supply chain practices. Automakers, for example, are reported to have pared production and even closed some plants in the past week, largely owing to supply shortages, though, doubtless, short-term demand uncertainties have also played a part. The effect on financial markets of the devastating attack on the World Trade Center was pronounced, as telecommunications and trading capacities were severely impaired. But the markets are mostly functioning now, albeit in some cases using contingency arrangements, and, as in the past, the infrastructure will be rapidly restored. For a brief time, the terrorist attack markedly disrupted payment transfers that are usually measured in terms of trillions of dollars each day. Many obligators temporarily lost their technical ability to pay on time, leaving those counting on receiving payments caught short. The pressures ultimately ended up concentrated in banks. Those needs were met by the Federal Reserve, both through record lending at the discount window and through an extraordinary infusion of funds through open market operations. To facilitate the channeling of dollar liquidity to foreign financial institutions operating in the United States, thirty-day currency swap lines were arranged with major central banks, again in record volumes. It was essential in such an environment to meet all appropriate demands for dollar liquidity. As the financial markets and payment infrastructure return to normal, loans are being repaid, and the temporarily bloated balance sheet of the Federal Reserve is now shrinking back to normal. Nobody has the capacity to fathom fully how the tragedy of September 11 will play out. But in the weeks ahead, as the shock wears off, we should be able to better gauge how the ongoing dynamics of these events are shaping the immediate economic outlook. For the longer term, prospects for continued rapid technological advance and associated faster productivity growth are scarcely diminished. Those prospects, born of the ingenuity of our people and the strength of our system, fortify a promising future for our free nation.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced it is extending the deadline for public comment on the potential longer-term direction of the Board's policy on payments system risk. Comment is requested by November 16, 2001 . As a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, some organizations with an interest in the potential longer-term policy direction of the Board's payments system risk policy have had to devote significant resources to ensuring the continued smooth functioning of the payments system and financial markets. The Board has extended the original October 1 comment deadline to provide these organizations with adequate time to analyze the issues raised in the notice and to incorporate their perspectives on recent financial market experiences. The longer-term policy options include: lowering self-assessed net debit caps and eliminating the two-week average caps; implementing differential pricing for collateralized and uncollateralized daylight overdrafts; and rejecting payments with settlement-day finality that would cause an institution to exceed its daylight overdraft capacity level. The Board's notice is attached.
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Commodity Futures Trading Commission Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Trade Commission National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision Securities and Exchange Commission WORKSHOP PLANNED TO DISCUSS STRATEGIES FOR PROVIDING EFFECTIVE FINANCIAL PRIVACY NOTICES Public Workshop Co-sponsored by Eight Federal Agencies An interagency-sponsored public workshop on Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB) Act privacy notices will be held on Tuesday, December 4, 2001, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Room 432, Washington, D.C. 20580. The workshop will provide a forum to identify successful GLB Act privacy notices, discuss strategies for communicating complex information, and encourage industry self-regulatory efforts and consumer and business education. The workshop will bring together financial institutions, consumer and privacy groups, experts on readability and consumer communication, and others to discuss the issues through moderated panel discussions. The GLB Act (Pub. L. No. 106-102) was signed into law on November 12, 1999. The eight federal agencies (GLB Agencies) co-sponsoring the workshop issued regulations implementing the privacy provisions of the GLB Act. Consistent with the Act, those regulations provide consumers the opportunity, with certain exceptions, to prevent financial institutions from disclosing consumer information to nonaffiliated third parties. They also require financial institutions to provide privacy notices to consumers. The GLB Agencies are: the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; the Department of Treasury, Offices of the Comptroller of the Currency and of Thrift Supervision; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; the Federal Trade Commission; the National Credit Union Administration; and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The event is open to the public and there is no fee for attendance. Pre-registration is strongly encouraged as seating is limited. The announcement of the workshop is posted on the FTC's Web site at and will be published shortly in the Federal Register. To pre-register, please e-mail your name and affiliation to by November 16, 2001. A detailed agenda and additional information on the workshop will be posted on the Web site before December 4. In addition, after the workshop, a transcript will be posted on the FTC Web site .
