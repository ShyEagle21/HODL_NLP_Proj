Remarks by Governor Edward M. Gramlich To the National Association of Real Estate Editors, Washington, D.C. June 3, 2005 HMDA Data and Their Effect on Mortgage Markets
Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For Immediate Release June 6, 2005 Agencies Issue FACT Act Interim Final Rules on Medical Information The federal bank, thrift, and credit union regulatory agencies today issued interim final rules under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) that create exceptions to the statutory prohibition against obtaining or using medical information in connection with credit eligibility determinations. The interim final rules also address the sharing of medically related information among affiliates. The effective date for these rules is nine months after the date of publication in the Federal Register , which is expected on or about June 9, 2005. Section 411 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act) amended the FCRA to provide that a creditor may not obtain or use medical information in connection with any determination of a consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit, except as permitted by regulations or the FACT Act. However, the FACT Act also requires the agencies to prescribe regulations that permit creditors to obtain and use medical information for credit eligibility purposes when necessary and appropriate to protect legitimate operational, transactional, risk, consumer, and other needs. A proposed rule was published for comment on April 28, 2004. The interim final rules create exceptions to the general statutory prohibition on obtaining and using medical information. The provisions are similar to those contained in the proposed rule and include exceptions for the use of medical information that is also financial information typically considered in credit underwriting. As authorized by the FACT Act, the agencies have expanded the scope of the rules so that the exceptions will apply to all creditors, not just to creditors ordinarily regulated by one of the agencies. Section 411 of the FACT Act also amended the FCRA to limit the ability of creditors and others to share medically related information among affiliates, except as permitted by the statute, regulation, or order. The interim final rules specify the circumstances in which creditors may share medically related information among affiliates without becoming consumer reporting agencies. The interim final rules are being issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision. The rules of each agency are substantively identical. The rules are being issued as interim final rules to allow for public comment on their expanded scope. The agencies request comment within thirty days after publication in the Federal Register . The Federal Register notice is attached.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Central Bank panel discussion To the International Monetary Conference, Beijing, PeopleÂ’s Republic of China (via satellite) June 6, 2005 The pronounced decline in U.S. Treasury long-term interest rates over the past year despite a 200-basis-point increase in our federal funds rate is clearly without recent precedent. The yield on ten-year Treasury notes currently is at about 4 percent, 80 basis points less than its level of a year ago. Moreover, despite the recent backup in credit risk spreads, yields for both investment-grade and less-than-investment-grade corporate bonds have declined even more than Treasuries over the same period. The unusual behavior of long-term rates first became apparent almost a year ago. In May and June of last year, market participants were behaving as expected. With a firming of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve widely expected, they built large short positions in long-term debt instruments in anticipation of the increase in bond yields that has been historically associated with a rising federal funds rate. But by summer, pressures emerged in the marketplace that drove long-term rates back down. In March of this year, market participants once again bid up long-term rates, but as occurred last year, forces came into play to make those increases short lived. But what are those forces? Clearly, they are not operating solely in the United States. Long-term rates have moved lower virtually everywhere. Except in Japan, rates among the other foreign Group of Seven countries have declined notably more than have rates in the United States. Even in emerging economies, whose history has been too often marked by inflationary imbalances and unstable exchange rates, access to longer-term finance has improved. For many years, emerging-market long-term debt denominated in domestic currencies had generally been unsalable. But in 2003, Mexico, for example, was able to issue a twenty-year maturity, peso-denominated bond, the first such instrument ever. In recent months, Colombia issued domestic-currency-denominated global bonds. As rates came down worldwide, dollar-denominated EMBI+ spreads over U.S. Treasuries receded to historically low levels, before widening modestly of late. * * * A number of hypotheses have been offered as explanations of this remarkable worldwide environment of low long-term interest rates. One prominent hypothesis is that the markets are signaling economic weakness. This is certainly a credible notion. But periodic signs of buoyancy in some areas of the global economy have not arrested the fall in rates. A second hypothesis involves the behavior of pension funds. As the inevitable increases in retirement populations approach, especially among developed countries, the underfunding of retirement plans has become a growing concern. Pension funds and insurance companies, are being pressed to make significant additions to longer-term bond portfolios. This demand for increasingly longer-term obligations is evident in the favorable reception given the fifty-year-maturity bonds recently issued by France and the United Kingdom. But world demographic trends are hardly news, and recent adjustments to funding shortfalls do not seem large enough to be more than a small part of a complete explanation. The heavy accumulation of U.S. Treasury obligations by foreign monetary authorities is yet another hypothesis that has been offered. And, doubtless, those purchases have lowered long-term U.S. Treasury rates. But, given the depth of the market for long-term Treasury instruments, the Federal Reserve Board staff estimates that the effect of foreign official purchases has been modest. Furthermore, such purchases seem an implausible explanation of why yields on long-term non -U.S. sovereign debt instruments are so low. A final hypothesis takes as its starting point the breakup of the Soviet Union and the integration of China and India into the global trading market, developments that have permitted more of the world's lower-cost productive capacity to be tapped to satisfy global demands for goods and services. Concurrently, greater integration of financial markets has meant that a larger share of the world's pool of savings is being deployed in cross-border financing of cost-reducing investments. The enlargement of global markets for goods, services, and finance has contributed importantly to the favorable inflation performance that we are witnessing in so many countries. That improved performance has doubtless contributed to lower inflation-related risk premiums, and the lowering of these premiums is reflected in significant declines in nominal and real long-term rates. Although this explanation contributes to an understanding of the past decade, I do not believe it explains the decline of long-term interest rates over the past year despite rising short-term rates. * * * Whatever the underlying causes, low risk-free long-term rates worldwide seem to be one factor driving investors to reach for higher returns, thereby lowering the compensation for bearing credit risk and many other financial risks over recent years. The search for yield is particularly manifest in the massive inflows of funds to private equity firms and hedge funds. These entities have been able to raise significant resources from investors who are apparently seeking above-average risk-adjusted rates of return, which, of course, can be achieved by only a minority of investors. To meet this demand, hedge fund managers are devising increasingly more complex trading strategies to exploit perceived arbitrage opportunities, which are judged--in many cases erroneously--to offer excess rates of return. This effort is particularly evident in the pronounced growth and increasing complexity of collateralized debt obligations. Although collateralized debt obligations are a powerful tool for enhancing risk management by separating idiosyncratic risks from systematic risks, the models used to price and hedge these instruments are just beginning to be tested. I have no doubt that many of the new hedge fund entrepreneurs are embracing a strategy of pinpointing temporary market inefficiencies, the exploitation of which is expected to yield above-average rates of return. For the time being, most of the low-hanging fruit of readily available profits has already been picked by the managers of the massive influx of hedge fund capital, leaving as a byproduct much-more-efficient markets and normal returns. But continuing efforts to seek above-average returns could create risks for which compensation is inadequate. Significant numbers of trading strategies are already destined to prove disappointing, a point that recent data on the distribution of hedge fund returns seem to be confirming. Consequently, after its recent very rapid advance, the hedge fund industry could temporarily shrink, and many wealthy fund managers and investors could become less wealthy. But so long as banks and other lenders to these ventures are managing their credit risks effectively, this necessary adjustment should not pose a threat to financial stability. I trust such an episode would not induce us to lose sight of the very important contributions hedge funds and new financial products have made to financial stability by increasing market liquidity and spreading financial risk, and thereby enhancing economic flexibility and resilience. * * * The economic and financial world is changing in ways that we still do not fully comprehend. Policymakers accordingly cannot always count on an ability to anticipate potentially adverse developments sufficiently in advance to effectively address them. Thus our economies require, in my judgment, as high a degree of flexibility and resilience to unanticipated shocks as is feasible to achieve. Policymakers need to be able to rely more on the markets' self-adjusting process and less on officials' uncertain forecasting capabilities. The U.S. economy's response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, is a case in point. That shock was absorbed by a recently enhanced, highly flexible set of institutions and markets without significantly disabling our economy overall. But that flexibility should not be taken for granted, and every effort should be made to preserve and extend it. In this regard, the recent emergence of protectionism and the continued structural rigidities in many parts of the world are truly worrisome. In the end, I trust that we will all recognize our common interest in fostering global and domestic arrangements that promote the prosperity of our citizens.
The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced the issuance of a Final Decision and Cease and Desist Order against eighteen former institution-affiliated parties of First Western Bank, Cooper City, Florida, and an Order of Prohibition against Carl V. Thomas, one of the former institution-affiliated parties. The Orders were the result of an action brought by the Board to address violations of the Change in Bank Control Act in connection with the respondents' acquisition of shares of First Western Bank in 1997 and 1998. Attached are the Board's Final Decision and Orders relating to this action.
Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies At the American Bankers Association Chief Financial Officers Exchange Conference, Chicago, Illinois June 7, 2005 Community Banks: A Regulatory Update I would like to thank the American Bankers Association for inviting me to participate in this conference. After a brief overview of the current state of the nation's community banks, I will discuss three issues that Federal Reserve supervisors are thinking a lot about and that I know are of great interest to community bankers: credit risk, particularly in real estate; compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act; and, potential revisions to the current minimum regulatory capital requirements for community banks. State of the Industry When I look at the U.S. banking system today, I see two divergent trends. On the one hand, the majority of banking assets are increasingly concentrated in a small number of large complex banking organizations that operate across wide geographic regions and diverse business lines. On the other hand, thousands of smaller institutions still focus on local communities or regions, providing invaluable services and promoting healthy competition across the nation. In fact, despite the much-touted consolidation in the banking industry and the high levels of competition in many markets, there are more than 8,000 banks in this country, and close to 90 percent of those institutions have less than $1 billion in assets. Entrepreneurs still seem to see prospects in the sector. Over the past five years, two new de novo charters have been approved for every five bank mergers. This tradition of locally oriented banks makes this country unusual among developed nations and, I believe, contributes significantly to our financial diversity and economic resilience. Small banks also continue to provide valuable sources of funding for small businesses within their local communities. If you look at their balance sheets and income statements, you will see that community banks are thriving. Capital, earnings, and asset quality are improving for banks of all sizes, but particularly for community banks. In 2004, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and loan-loss provisions for community banks were at long-term lows. High returns on equity--just less than 12 percent for community banks--and a steady flow of new bank charter applications and approvals suggest that banking has been and remains a profitable industry. The continuing strength of the financial sector is also visible in supervisory ratings. At year-end 2004, less than 1 percent of community banks nationwide were rated below the threshold for problem institutions. Meanwhile, with the adoption of risk-focused supervision, supervisory attention is more focused on risk management and internal control weaknesses. In other words, examiners today are much more likely to identify problems early and work with bankers to address the issues before the problems have been manifested in poor financial performance. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a bank that had been downgraded to a CAMELS composite 3 may already have had embedded asset-quality problems that were as likely to get worse as better and that required the injection of additional capital or other appropriate action to resolve. That is a marked contrast to the situation today, in which most of our problem banks stay in business and restore themselves to a satisfactory condition. So far, I've painted a fairly rosy picture of the conditions in the banking industry today. But banking regulators are paid to worry. Credit Risk One of the things that we bank regulators worry about is credit risk, which has historically been the leading cause of bank failures. Of course, credit performance has been very strong lately and banks of all sizes survived the recent recession with only a slight decline in credit quality. So far this year, commercial-loan demand has rebounded and consumer lending, particularly mortgage financing, has been brisk. But banking supervisors are always worried that, in good times of rising loan growth and competition among bankers, more-aggressive underwriting may set the stage for future deterioration in credit quality. In the residential-mortgage segment in particular, some market analysts have begun to express concern about rising levels of consumer debt; the growing popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages and "affordability products"; growth in the subprime sector; and certain questionable risk-management practices in home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. According to the National Association of Realtors, second homes and purchases of residential real estate for investment purposes together accounted for almost 40 percent of all home purchases last year. Given the vast growth in residential housing markets and the apparent slippage in underwriting standards in certain sectors, it is entirely appropriate for banking supervisors to seek to ensure that banks are employing proper risk-management practices. To remind bankers of those sound practices, last month the federal banking agencies released guidance on credit-risk management for financial institutions' HELOC activities. The recent growth in HELOCs has been remarkable: At the end of 2004, outstanding drawn HELOCs at all insured commercial banks totaled $398 billion, a 40 percent increase over 2003. Meanwhile, the agencies have observed some easing of underwriting standards, with lenders competing to attract home equity lending business. Lenders are sometimes offering interest-only loans, high loan-to-value ratios, and limited requirements for documentation of a borrower's assets and income. They are also relying more on automated valuation models and entering into more transactions with loan brokers and other third parties. Given this easing of standards, there is concern that banks' home equity loan portfolios may be vulnerable to a rise in interest rates and a decline in home values. In other words, there is a concern that not all banks fully recognize the embedded risks in some of their portfolios. But supervisors believe that, like most other lending activity, home equity lending can be conducted in a safe and sound manner with appropriate risk-management systems. Credit risk involving commercial real estate is another area of regulatory attention. While the sector is generally stable or improving, banking supervisors are carefully monitoring rising commercial real estate concentrations at some banking organizations, particularly regional and community banks. Smaller banks as a group have shown the strongest appetite for commercial real estate loans, and some claim that commercial real estate lending remains one of the few areas in which small banks can effectively compete with their larger competitors. So far, underwriting standards are high by historic standards, and much higher than in the period preceding the crises of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Still, there have been signs recently that standards may be under some downward pressure as a result of strong competition and tight spreads. At a recent Risk Management Association roundtable, several bank appraisers conceded that they are pressured to make deals on the assumption that exceptionally strong performance will continue indefinitely. Supervisors are monitoring to see whether risk-management practices and capital levels are keeping pace with loan growth at individual banking organizations. I want to touch on one final topic related to credit risk. In March, the federal regulators issued for public comment a proposal to change the supervisory framework for the classification of problem loans. The current system dates back to 1938 and has undergone only minor revisions reflecting evolutionary changes in banking practices. The proposal would replace the current classified commercial loan categories--"special mention," "substandard," and "doubtful"--with a framework consisting of two parts: a borrower evaluation (to assess the risk of the borrower defaulting on its obligations) and a facility rating (to measure the severity of the loss the bank would likely incur in the event of default). In comparison with the old system, we believe that the proposed new system is more compatible with financial institutions' allowance for loan and lease loss methodologies and rating-assessment processes. The new system leverages off of many determinations and estimates banks already must make to comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which means that banks should benefit from a more-efficient assessment process and improved clarity. We also believe the new system would increase consistency among the agencies in assessing the credit risk in a bank's commercial loan portfolio. Although the proposal went out for public comment only recently, one comment we have heard so far is that this represents an effort to implement Basel II in disguise, or, similarly, that it imposes too much of a burden on financial institutions. It's useful to remember that the loan-classification system applies to only a relatively small portion of a bank's portfolio. What we are proposing is good risk management and an improved system that, if implemented properly, can produce more consistency both between bank and supervisory practices and with expectations of accounting standards. In addition, if this framework is implemented, we intend to allow an extended transition period to minimize the potential burden and cost of changing to a new system. The comment period ends on June 30, and we will review the public comments carefully. Bank Secrecy Act Another issue of importance to bankers is the Bank Secrecy Act. We in Washington fully appreciate that a few high-profile companies have drawn considerable public attention to the issue of compliance with this act and that expectations for compliance are not limited to very large institutions. You too are bearing the burden of new statutes and regulations and the costs of implementing effective compliance programs. But we must recognize and accept that the environment changed on September 11, 2001. At the same time, I want to assure you that the approach taken by the Fed and the other federal banking agencies is not one of zero tolerance and that supervisors do not issue enforcement actions against banking organizations because they have failed to file a single suspicious activity report. On the contrary, we continue to expect examiners to use their best judgment and to look for systematic weaknesses in programs, policies, procedures, and internal controls. Interagency efforts are now underway to develop and issue a new, uniform Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual . The targeted release date is June 30. The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking supervisors, with the active participation of FinCEN--the entity within the U.S. Treasury that is statutorily responsible for the implementation of the Bank Secrecy Act, are now drafting the new compliance guidance and examination procedures. As part of the rollout of the new BSA/AML Examination Manual, nationwide conference calls and regional outreach meetings will be held for bankers interested in understanding the procedures. Bankers are encouraged to participate in these voluntary sessions. We are also putting a great deal of effort into examiner training to promote consistency. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the other federal bank supervisory agencies signed a memorandum of understanding with FinCEN last year to share critical information about banking organizations' compliance with the law. By providing pertinent Bank Secrecy Act information to FinCEN, which is adding staff to fulfill its responsibilities, the Federal Reserve and the other regulators can now better coordinate their supervision with FinCEN, thus further reducing the potential for unwarranted compliance burdens on the industry. The bottom line is that any bank of any size should always be on guard for suspicious activities, and whenever they know, suspect, or have reason to suspect a violation of law, they should file suspicious activity reports according to Federal Reserve and FinCEN regulations. Bankers have to do enough due diligence to know when a transaction is suspicious--for instance, if it has no business purpose or if it seems structured to get around Bank Secrecy Act regulations. On a related matter, in April the agencies issued guidance on money-services businesses, or MSBs, and how to handle them. The concern among bankers, which may result in part from misconceptions about the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, was that they were being held responsible for monitoring the activities of their customers. We hope that our guidance will reassure financial institutions that it is not our view that all money services firms present an unacceptably high risk of money laundering or other illegal activities, that we are not instructing banks to close MSB accounts, and that we do not expect the banks to regulate MSBs. Basel I Amendments Finally, as I'm sure you are aware, bank regulators have been working at the international level over the past several years to revise the Basel Accord, the risk-based capital framework. Capital adequacy is a perennial concern of bank supervisors. The proposed revisions, especially the advanced approaches of Basel II, represent a sea change in how banks determine their minimum level of required capital for regulatory purposes. The advanced approaches are intended to better align regulatory capital with inherent risks and banks' internal economic capital and will encourage large complex organizations to strengthen risk-measurement and -management systems. Of course, the more advanced approaches of Basel II are clearly designed for large complex banks and will not be required for community banks or even for most regional banking organizations. U.S. regulators are very sensitive to the possible competitive implications of having two sets of rules for the banking industry. Some community bankers in particular have expressed concerns about the competitive impact of the Basel II capital accord on non-Basel II banks, particularly for residential mortgages and retail and small-business loans. In response, the Federal Reserve has conducted a number of studies on whether Basel II will create significant market distortions for the vast majority of banking organizations that remain on Basel I. These studies have suggested that competitive impacts will be mild for some business lines, while for others, such as some types of small-business loans, it does appear that unintended competitive advantages and disadvantages might be created--depending in part on how Basel II ultimately is implemented in the United States. Where these concerns appear valid, we and the other federal banking agencies will propose remedies in the form of revisions to the current Basel I-based capital rules. It is our current intention to issue a proposal to revise the Basel I-based capital rules at close to the same time that we issue the proposed rulemaking for Basel II. We would like to allow the banking community to compare and comment on both proposals, for the very reason that we are sensitive to the potential for competitive distortions. Moreover, as in the past, if competitive or other issues later arise that we cannot now adequately foresee, the Federal Reserve will make appropriate adjustments to the rules. I want to make clear that I see no reason to replace the Basel I-based regulatory framework for the vast majority of banks here in the United States with a complex framework similar to advanced Basel II. The Basel I-based framework has evolved modestly over time in response to market developments and to address safety and soundness-related issues. With occasional continued modifications, the current risk-based capital regime should remain appropriate for most U.S. banking organizations for many years to come. It is also important for you to know that, as supervisors, we will not look upon institutions as having deficient risk-management systems simply because they choose to stay under the Basel I capital framework. As supervisors, our focus will continue to be on ensuring that risk-management processes are appropriate for operations of each institution and that those risk systems operate effectively. Thus, we expect that non-Basel II banks can continue to have CAMELS 1 and 2 ratings as long as they operate in a safe and sound manner. Note that Basel I and Basel II are not the only capital regulations under which U.S. institutions will operate. More than a decade ago, the Congress, as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act's prompt-corrective-action (PCA) regime, defined a critically undercapitalized insured depository institution by reference to a minimum tangible-equity-to-asset requirement--a leverage ratio. The agencies have also used leverage ratios to define other PCA capital categories because experience has suggested that there is no substitute for an adequate equity-to-asset ratio, especially for entities that face the moral hazard that accompanies the federal safety net. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is responsible to the Congress for the management of the critical deposit-insurance portion of the safety net, has underlined the importance of that minimum leverage ratio and PCA as part of a prudent supervisory regime. The Federal Reserve concurs with the FDIC's view. As I have mentioned, we need the risk-measurement and risk-management infrastructure and the risk sensitivity of Basel II; but we also need the supplementary assurance of a minimum equity base. Meanwhile, even if supervisors did not call for a minimum leverage ratio, I firmly believe that bankers, investors, and rating agencies would demand it. This leverage ratio would be the same under the amended Basel I framework as it would be under the Basel II framework. Conclusion In conclusion, I would like to say again that we at the Federal Reserve believe that small banking organizations provide a valuable service to our financial markets and our economy. We also understand the depth and complexity of the issues that banks face today, from capital to credit risk to compliance issues, and we acknowledge that in some cases these issues are particularly challenging for smaller financial institutions. At the Federal Reserve, we are doing everything we can to keep the playing field level as our policies and regulatory practices evolve with the industry.
Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies At the Risk USA 2005 Congress, Boston, Massachusetts June 8, 2005 Enhancing Risk Management under Basel II Thank you very much for the invitation to speak today. I am particularly honored to be among so many esteemed risk-management practitioners and researchers, including bankers, consultants, academics, and fellow supervisors. I hope that my remarks will contribute to the collaborative spirit of this conference. Indeed, I am sure you agree that gatherings such as this are an excellent opportunity to share ideas about developing new techniques and practices, as well as revisiting existing ones. Today I plan to share with you some views on the Basel II framework, especially its proposed implementation in the United States. I will first touch briefly upon the broader objectives of the framework, then offer some thoughts about complexity in Basel II, provide additional detail about the risk-measurement and risk-management aspects of Basel II, and close with a short discussion about current implementation issues. Objectives of Basel II The release last June of the new international capital framework, often referred to as Basel II, was a major development. It is composed of the now-familiar three pillars: Pillar 1, minimum capital requirements; Pillar 2, self assessment and supervisory review; and Pillar 3, market discipline. The major objectives of Basel II include creating a better link between minimum regulatory capital and risk, enhancing market discipline, supporting a level playing field in an increasingly integrated global financial system, establishing and maintaining a minimum capital cushion sufficient to foster financial stability in periods of adversity and uncertainty, and grounding risk measurement and management in actual data and formal quantitative techniques. Let me emphasize that last objective, since it is often overlooked. Critical to Basel II is the effort to improve risk measurement and management, especially at our largest, most complex organizations. In a general sense, Basel II expands advanced risk-measurement and -management techniques from a set of tools used in an operating and control environment into the basis for making minimum regulatory capital more reflective of risk exposures. Since individual organizations employ various types of risk-management techniques, moving to Basel II as a minimum regulatory capital framework requires a certain degree of standardization so that risk measures can be reasonably compared across organizations and over time. From the outset of our participation in the development of Basel II, the U.S. banking agencies have clearly and consistently stated that the final adoption of the new capital rules in the United States would occur only after (1) we had reviewed all public comments and incorporated any needed adjustments to address legitimate concerns and (2) we were satisfied that Basel II was consistent with safe and sound banking in this country. Throughout this process we have stressed that, if we become concerned about the level of overall capital in the banking system or the capital results for individual portfolios, we would seek to modify the framework, including--should it come to that--possibly recalibrating the regulatory capital formulas that translate an individual bank's risk parameters into minimum required capital. The agencies' current review and study are consistent with our historical position at Basel. Complexity in Basel II One often hears that the advanced approaches of Basel II are "too complex" for anyone to understand, and the mathematical formulas in various drafts of the guidance can look like a foreign language to some readers. Attendees at this conference clearly understand that large, internationally active financial institutions have become more complex in terms of both sophistication of services and business practices, as well as organizational structure. As a result, effective risk management has been evolving to support these innovative financial structures. Indeed, Basel II may not look that complex to many of you here today, given your experience with more-sophisticated risk and internal economic capital models. So you would probably agree with me that even before Basel II is adopted, most banking organizations involved in complex financial instruments should already possess an understanding of advanced risk concepts and should have implemented effective risk-measurement and -management practices. As prudent supervisors, all of the U.S. banking agencies require any organization employing sophisticated financial practices or using complex financial instruments to have a governance and control structure commensurate with those activities. That is, the bank must have knowledgeable staff to set risk limits effectively and clearly communicate them to executive management and their boards of directors, must have acquired and implemented effective mitigating controls, and must have a robust process for monitoring exposures. That is one of the reasons that in the United States we are proposing to require only the largest, most sophisticated financial institutions to adopt Basel II--and only the advanced approaches. These institutions recognize that complex operations require a more-structured and well-defined risk-management framework to monitor the effectiveness of internal control processes and risk exposures. For these organizations, the incremental cost of adopting Basel II advanced approaches, while admittedly significant, should be relatively modest compared with the significant risk-management investments they have already made. For financial institutions with simpler organizational structures and less-complex processes and services, a less-sophisticated enterprise-wide risk-management framework is entirely appropriate. For these organizations, the incremental cost of developing advanced Basel II systems can be substantial, and they may appropriately choose not to adopt Basel II, especially at the earliest possible date. If they do choose to opt in, they may want to implement Basel II later, when they can take advantage of vendor models and databases to assist in the development of their systems at much lower costs. Whatever the case, we expect them to take a hard look at whether moving to Basel II is worthwhile from a cost-benefit perspective. Risk Management and Basel II Basel II strengthens the link between regulatory capital and risk management. Under the advanced approaches, in particular, banks will be required to adopt more-formal, quantitative risk-measurement and risk-management procedures and processes. For instance, Basel II establishes standards for data collection and the systematic use of the information collected. These standards are consistent with broader supervisory expectations that high-quality risk management at large complex organizations will depend upon credible data. Enhancements to technological infrastructure--combined with an appropriate database--will, over time, allow firms to better price exposures and measure and manage risk. The emphasis on improved data standards in the revised Accord should not be interpreted solely as a regulatory capital requirement, but rather as a foundation for risk-management practices that will strengthen the value of the banking franchise. Even the best processes for evaluating risk and performance suffer if the data used are flawed. In this broader sense, "data integrity" can refer not only to the consistency, accuracy, and appropriateness of the information in the database and model, but also to the processes that produce and use this information. Used this way, "data integrity" includes quality of credit files, tracking of key customer characteristics, internal processes and controls, and even the training that supports them all. As this audience knows well, good risk management is more than just data. In their proposed supervisory guidance relating to Pillar 1, the U.S. banking agencies have stressed the importance of control and oversight mechanisms. In this area, we expect to hold institutions to standards that will be just as high as those pertaining to quantification and data maintenance. If banks do not create an appropriate environment in which their quantitative risk measures and associated models are used--in other words, if an institution considers internal controls to be just a checklist--risk measures will not provide the performance the bank hopes to achieve. Furthermore, we expect improved risk management not only through the more-formal quantitative basis of measurement in Pillar 1, but also through the other two pillars. Pillar 2 requires each bank to develop its own viable internal process for assessing capital adequacy that contributes to the determination of the amount of capital actually held. For instance, each institution must correct for Pillar 1 assumptions that may not apply to that particular bank--for example, if the "well diversified" assumption of Basel II is not met by an individual bank because of its geographic or sectoral concentrations. In essence, the bank should determine whether its capital levels are appropriate in light of any deviations from Pillar 1 assumptions. The added transparency in Pillar 3 should also generate improved market discipline for these large organizations, in some cases forcing them to run a better business. Market discipline is not possible if counterparties and rating agencies do not have good information about banks' risk positions and the techniques used to manage those positions. Indeed, market participants play a useful role by requiring banks to hold more capital than implied by minimum regulatory capital requirements--or sometimes their own economic capital models--and by demanding additional disclosures about how risks are being identified, measured, and managed. Greater transparency also offers an opportunity for market participants to monitor banks' progress over time and identify if they are keeping up with the latest techniques. Even though Basel II should be a major step forward in supporting effective risk management, we do not expect to let best practices be limited to what Basel II requires. For example, if you learn things at this conference that might augment your ability to measure risk at your institution, you should by all means pursue them. Flexibility has been built into Basel II so that improved techniques for doing such things as measuring potential loss or forecasting exposures can be used within the framework. As a former banker, I encourage banks' risk managers to continue their pursuit of improved risk measurement and risk management, making sure not to neglect internal controls and qualitative factors. Current Implementation Issues I now want to offer a few remarks about the latest developments in Basel II implementation in the United States. As most of you know, the U.S. banking agencies recently concluded their fourth Quantitative Impact Study, known as QIS4. In a statement issued on April 29, the U.S. banking agencies indicated that the minimum regulatory capital charges resulting from QIS4 were more variable across institutions and these capital charges dropped more, in the aggregate, than the agencies had expected. This was the impetus for deciding to delay issuance of our next round of proposals for Basel II. The agencies' reaction to the QIS4 results should signal how seriously we are taking the Basel II effort and how we are striving to implement it correctly. The results from QIS4 show the continued benefit of conducting periodic quantitative impact studies. They serve as a milestone, helping us evaluate progress as we move to Basel II. We now must determine the reasons for the results from QIS4. Were there limits to the QIS4 exercise? Is there a need for adjustments to the Basel framework itself? Do the QIS4 results reflect actual differences in risk among respondents when prior supervisory information suggested more similarity in credit quality? Do the results indicate the various stages of preparedness among participants, especially relating to data availability? None of the participating banks have completed their databases and models for all of their risk areas. In some cases, this created results that could not be relied upon for the implementation of Basel II. For example, for some portfolios, losses reflected only the last year or two of results. Thus, the strong credit performance of recent experience was not balanced by higher losses at other points in the credit cycle. Analysis of the data used in QIS4 is vitally important, because the ultimate success of Basel II will depend both on the quantity and quality of data that banks have to use as inputs to the framework and on our understanding of the limitations of those data. And as I noted before, these data are fundamental to the proper management of risk at large complex institutions, even outside the realm of regulatory capital. Even though we are still in the midst of our analysis of QIS4 data, we recognize that substantial data limitations may prevent banks from developing viable and robust parameter estimates in the near term. For this reason, both banks and their supervisors will have to wait while data accumulate before banks can estimate and validate parameter inputs in a reliable, robust manner. In the interim, banks and supervisors will have to rely heavily on qualitative validation approaches. Supervisors across countries are working together to address validation issues, and, I believe, will develop useful guidelines for banks and supervisors alike. In addition, we will likely need certain safeguards until we have confidence in the data systems producing Basel II estimates. And qualitative and quantitative benchmarking studies, which compare methodologies and parameter estimates across banks, will be important validation tools and will encourage the diffusion of best practices throughout the industry both during the initial, more-qualitative interval and later, when more quantitative approaches are used. In addition to learning what we can from the QIS4 results, we will also assess comments on the trading and banking book proposals released jointly by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions. We intend to incorporate those treatments and revisions into the interagency notice of proposed rulemaking for implementing Basel II in the United States and hope to complete our efforts in a timely manner. Although the agencies have decided to delay the notice of proposed rulemaking while we review the QIS4 results, we remain committed to Basel II. We recognize that we must continue to give institutions as much information as possible to help them with their preparations. And we remain committed to providing helpful information to institutions as soon as it becomes available--for example, the draft supervisory guidance documents that are now under development. We do, however, recognize that certain time pressures exist for institutions wishing to implement the new framework at the earliest possible date. On the one hand, those institutions are encouraged to start preparations as soon as possible; on the other hand, we leave open the possibility that elements of the framework could change. I recognize that this is not a trivial matter, and I sympathize with the challenges you face in deciding which investments and upgrades you should make to your systems and personnel. When it comes to Basel II, we recognize that certain details relating to systems and processes will depend on what the final U.S. rule and guidance contain. Accordingly, we are available to discuss your implementation efforts at any time, and we want to hear specifics about which elements of the proposal you think will demand the greatest investments or generate the greatest uncertainty. With that information, the agencies can then determine where best to target resources to assist institutions during the transition to Basel II. We certainly hope that many upgrades made for Basel II are those that would have been made anyway. Conclusion These are challenging times both for banks and for bank supervisors. On the one hand, new technologies and markets afford us exciting opportunities to meaningfully strengthen the risk-measurement and -management capabilities of our financial institutions. On the other hand, the risks of getting it wrong--of failing to keep banks' risk-management practices up-to-date--can only grow as banking becomes ever more complex and sophisticated and as banking systems become more concentrated. This will increase the importance of capital adequacy, risk management, effective supervision, and transparency in fostering and maintaining financial stability in an increasingly integrated and interconnected global financial system. Indeed, supervisors and bankers need to maintain a healthy skepticism about the uncertainties and real-world vicissitudes surrounding any theoretically precise measures of risk--particularly in times of adversity, when capital cushions are so important. Qualitative factors such as sound judgment, knowledge, and real-world experience are essential to successful risk management. Our hope is that the implementation of Basel II will substantially improve institutions' ability to measure and manage their risks. But we expect that Basel II will complement the evolution of banks' own processes and systems, not supplant them. Finally, we also anticipate that Basel II will allow for the open development of new risk-management techniques, as they evolve over time.
The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the issuance of a consent Order of Assessment of a Civil Money Penalty against the Bank of Pontiac, Pontiac, Illinois, a state member bank. The Bank of Pontiac, without admitting to any allegations, consented to the issuance of the Order in connection with its alleged violations of the Board's Regulations implementing the National Flood Insurance Act. The Order requires the Bank of Pontiac to pay a civil money penalty of $32,550, which will be remitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for deposit into the National Flood Mitigation Fund. A copy of the Order is attached.
Testimony of Governor Donald L. Kohn Regulatory relief Before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives June 9, 2005 Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on issues related to regulatory relief. The Board strongly supports the efforts of Congress to review periodically the federal banking laws to determine whether they can be streamlined without compromising the safety and soundness of banking organizations, consumer protections, or other important objectives that Congress has established for the financial system. In 2003, at Chairman Oxley's request, the Board provided the Committee with a number of legislative proposals that we believe are consistent with this goal, and the Board recently agreed to support several additional regulatory relief proposals. A summary of the proposals supported by the Board is included in the appendix to my testimony. In my remarks, I will highlight those that would provide the most meaningful regulatory relief. For its part, the Board strives to review each of our regulations at least once every five years to identify those provisions that are out of date or otherwise unnecessary. The Board also has been an active participant in the ongoing regulatory review process being conducted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA). EGRPRA requires the federal banking agencies, at least once every ten years, to review and seek public comment on the burden associated with the full range of the agencies' regulations that affect insured depository institutions. The Board and the other banking agencies are in the midst of the first ten-year review cycle, and I am pleased to report that we are on track to complete this process by the 2006 deadline. The agencies already have solicited comments on five broad categories of regulations--including those governing applications, activities, money laundering, and consumer protection in lending transactions--and have conducted outreach meetings throughout the country to encourage public participation in the EGRPRA process. In response to these efforts, the agencies have received comments from more than 1,000 entities and individuals on ways to reduce the regulatory burden on banking organizations. The Board will consider and incorporate the comments relevant to our regulations as we move forward with our own regulation review efforts. While the banking agencies can achieve some burden reductions through administrative action, Congress plays a critical role in the regulatory relief process. Many proposals to reduce regulatory burden require congressional action to implement. Moreover, the Congress has ultimate responsibility for establishing the overall regulatory framework for banking organizations, and through its actions Congress can ensure that regulatory relief is consistent with the framework it has established to maintain the safety and soundness of banking organizations and promote other important public policy goals. Interest on Reserves, Reserve Requirements and Interest on Demand Deposits I am pleased to note that some of the Board's most important regulatory relief suggestions--including those authorizing the Federal Reserve to pay interest on balances held by depository institutions at Reserve Banks, enhancing the Board's flexibility to set reserve requirements, and permitting depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits--recently were passed by the House as part of H.R. 1224, the Business Checking Freedom Act of 2005. Let me briefly explain why the Board supports passage of these amendments, either in a stand-alone bill or as part of a broader regulatory relief bill. I will also discuss a little later why the Board does not support those aspects of H.R. 1224 that would, for the first time, authorize industrial loan companies that operate outside the supervisory framework established for other insured banks to offer interest-bearing transaction accounts to business customers. For the purpose of implementing monetary policy, the Board is obliged by law to establish reserve requirements on certain deposits held at depository institutions. Because the Federal Reserve does not pay interest on the balances held at Reserve Banks to meet reserve requirements, depositories have an incentive to reduce their reserve balances to a minimum. To do so, they engage in a variety of reserve avoidance activities, including sweep arrangements that move funds from deposits that are subject to reserve requirements to deposits and money market investments that are not. These sweep programs and similar activities absorb real resources and therefore diminish the efficiency of our banking system. H.R. 1224 would allow the Federal Reserve to pay depository institutions interest on their required reserve balances, which would remove a substantial portion of the incentive for depositories to engage in reserve avoidance measures. The resulting improvements in efficiency should eventually be passed through to bank borrowers and depositors. Besides required reserve balances, depository institutions also voluntarily hold two other types of balances in their Reserve Bank accounts--contractual clearing balances and excess reserve balances. H.R. 1224 would authorize the Federal Reserve to pay explicit interest on these balances as well. This authority would enhance the Federal Reserve's toolkit for efficiently conducting monetary policy. In order for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to conduct monetary policy effectively, it is important that a sufficient and predictable demand for balances at the Reserve Banks exist so that the System knows the volume of reserves to supply (or remove) through open market operations to achieve the FOMC's target federal funds rate. Authorizing the Federal Reserve to pay explicit interest on contractual clearing balances and excess reserve balances, in addition to required reserve balances, could potentially provide a demand for voluntary balances that would be stable enough for monetary policy to be implemented effectively through existing procedures without the need for required reserve balances. In these circumstances, the Board could consider using the authority granted in H.R. 1224 to reduce--or even eliminate--reserve requirements, thereby reducing a regulatory burden for all depository institutions, without adversely affecting the Federal Reserve's ability to conduct monetary policy. Having the authority to pay interest on excess reserves also could help mitigate potential volatility in overnight interest rates. If the Federal Reserve was authorized to pay interest on excess reserves, and did so, the rate paid would act as a minimum for overnight interest rates, because banks would not generally lend to other banks at a lower rate than they could earn by keeping their excess funds at a Reserve Bank. Although the Board sees no need to pay interest on excess reserves in the near future, and any movement in this direction would need further study, the ability to do so would be a potentially useful addition to the monetary toolkit of the Federal Reserve. The Board also strongly supports the provisions of H.R. 1224 that would repeal the statutory restrictions that currently prohibit depository institutions from paying interest on demand deposits. Repealing the prohibition of interest on demand deposits would improve the overall efficiency of our financial sector and, in particular, should assist small banks in attracting and retaining business deposits. To compete for the liquid assets of businesses, banks have been compelled to set up complicated procedures to pay implicit interest on compensating balance accounts and they spend resources--and charge fees--for sweeping the excess demand deposits of businesses into money market investments on a nightly basis. Small banks, however, often do not have the resources to develop the sweep or other programs that are needed to compete for the deposits of business customers. Moreover, from the standpoint of the overall economy, the expenses incurred by institutions of all sizes to implement these programs are a waste of resources and would be unnecessary if institutions were permitted to pay interest on demand deposits directly. The costs incurred by banks in operating these programs are passed on, directly or indirectly, to their large and small business customers. Authorizing banks to pay interest on demand deposits would eliminate the need for these customers to pay for more costly sweep and compensating balance arrangements to earn a return on their demand deposits. H.R. 1224 contains a provision that is intended to address the potential federal budgetary impact of this proposal by requiring the Reserve Banks to transfer some of their capital surplus to the Treasury to cover the budgetary costs of paying interest on required reserves through 2009. As the Board has consistently pointed out, these transfers would not provide any true offsets to budgetary costs. Although these transfers would allow the Treasury to issue fewer securities, the Federal Reserve would need to lower its holdings of Treasury securities by the same amount to make the required transfers. Thus, the level of Treasury debt held by the public sector would be unchanged, and the Treasury's interest payments, net of receipts from the Federal Reserve, would be unaffected. De Novo Interstate Branching The Board has proposed an amendment that would remove outdated barriers to de novo interstate branching by banks. Since enactment of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal Act), all fifty states have permitted banks to expand on an interstate basis through the acquisition of an existing bank in their state. Interstate banking is not only good for banks, it is good for consumers and the economy. While the number of banks has fallen in recent years, the number of branches has risen sharply to more than 71,000 in 2004 compared with approximately 50,000 in 1990. More than 2,000 branches were opened by banks in 2004 alone. The creation of new branches helps maintain the competitiveness and dynamism of the American banking industry and improve access to banking services in otherwise under-served markets. It results in better banking services for households and small businesses, lower interest rates on loans, and higher interest rates on deposits. Interstate branching also increases convenience for customers who live, work, and operate across state borders. However, the Riegle-Neal Act permitted banks to open a branch in a new state without acquiring another bank only if the host state enacted legislation that expressly permits entry by de novo branching (an opt-in requirement). To date, twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of opt-in legislation, while twenty-nine states continue to require interstate entry through the acquisition of an existing bank. This limitation on de novo branching is an obstacle to interstate entry for all banks and also creates special problems for small banks seeking to operate across state lines. Moreover, it creates an unlevel playing field between banks and federal savings associations, which have long been allowed to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis. The Board's proposed amendment would remove this last obstacle to full interstate branching for banks and level the playing field between banks and thrifts. The amendment also would remove the parallel provision that allows states to impose a minimum requirement on the age of banks that are acquired by an out-of-state banking organization. These changes would allow banks, including in particular small banks near state borders, to better serve their customers by establishing new interstate branches and acquiring newly chartered banks across state lines. It also would increase competition by providing banks a less costly method for offering their services at new locations. The establishment and operation of any new interstate branches would continue to be subject to the other regulatory provisions and conditions established by Congress for de novo interstate branches, including the financial, managerial, and community reinvestment requirements set forth in the Riegle-Neal Act. Small Bank Examination Flexibility Another amendment that the Board has supported would expand the number of small institutions that qualify for an extended examination cycle. Federal law currently mandates that the appropriate federal banking agency conduct an on-site examination of each insured depository institution at least once every twelve months. The statute, however, permits institutions that have $250 million or less in assets and that meet certain capital, managerial, and other criteria to be examined on an eighteen-month cycle. As the primary federal supervisors for state-chartered banks, the Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) may alternate responsibility for conducting these examinations with the appropriate state supervisory authority if the Board or FDIC determines that the state examination carries out the purposes of the statute. The $250 million asset cutoff for an eighteen-month examination cycle has not been raised since 1994. The Board's proposed amendment would raise this asset cap from $250 million to $500 million, thus potentially allowing approximately an additional 1,100 insured depository institutions to qualify for an eighteen-month examination cycle. The proposed amendment would provide meaningful relief to small institutions without jeopardizing the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions. Under the proposed amendment, an institution with less than $500 million in assets would qualify for the eighteen-month examination cycle only if the institution was well capitalized, well managed, and met the other criteria established by Congress in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. The amendment also would continue to require that all insured depository institutions undergo a full-scope, on-site examination at least once every twelve or eighteen months. Importantly, the agencies would continue to have the ability to examine any institution more frequently and at any time if the agency determines an examination is necessary or appropriate. Despite advances in off-site monitoring, the Board continues to believe that regular on-site examinations play a critical role in helping bank supervisors detect and correct asset, risk-management or internal control problems at an institution before these problems result in claims on the deposit insurance funds. Permit the Board to Grant Exceptions to Attribution Rule The Board has proposed another amendment that we believe will help banking organizations maintain attractive benefits programs for their employees. The Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act) generally prohibits a bank holding company from owning, in the aggregate, more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any company without the Board's approval. The BHC Act also provides that any shares held by a trust for the benefit of a bank holding company's shareholders or employees are deemed to be controlled by the bank holding company itself. This attribution rule was intended to prevent a bank holding company from using a trust established for the benefit of its management, shareholders, or employees to evade the BHC Act's restrictions on the acquisition of shares of banks and nonbanking companies. While this attribution rule has proved to be a useful tool in preventing evasions of the BHC Act, it does not always provide an appropriate result. For example, it may not be appropriate to apply the attribution rule when the shares in question are acquired by a 401(k) plan that is widely held by, and operated for the benefit of, the employees of the bank holding company. In these situations, the bank holding company may not have the ability to influence the purchase or sale decisions of the employees or otherwise control the shares that are held by the plan in trust for its employees. The suggested amendment would allow the Board to address these situations by authorizing the Board to grant exceptions from the attribution rule where appropriate. Reduce Cross-Marketing Restrictions Another amendment proposed by the Board would modify the cross-marketing restrictions imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act) on the merchant banking and insurance company investments of financial holding companies. The GLB Act generally prohibits a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company from engaging in cross-marketing activities with a nonfinancial company that is owned by the same financial holding company under the GLB Act's merchant banking or insurance company investment authorities. However, the GLB Act currently permits a depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company, with Board approval, to engage in limited cross-marketing activities through statement stuffers and Internet websites with nonfinancial companies that are held under the act's insurance company investment authority (but not the act's merchant banking authority). The Board's proposed amendment would allow depository institutions controlled by a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with companies held under the merchant banking authority to the same extent, and subject to the same restrictions, as companies held under the insurance company investment authority. We believe that this parity of treatment is appropriate, and see no reason to treat the merchant banking and insurance investments of financial holding companies differently for purposes of the cross-marketing restrictions of the GLB Act. A second aspect of the amendment would liberalize the cross-marketing restrictions that apply to both merchant banking and insurance company investments. This aspect of the amendment would permit a depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with a nonfinancial company held under either the merchant banking or insurance company investment authority if the nonfinancial company is not controlled by the financial holding company. When a financial holding company does not control a portfolio company, cross-marketing activities are unlikely to materially undermine the separation between the nonfinancial portfolio company and the financial holding company's depository institution subsidiaries. Industrial Loan Companies As I noted earlier, the Board strongly supports allowing depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits and allowing banks to branch de novo across state lines. The Board, however, opposes proposals that would allow industrial loan companies (ILCs) to offer business NOW accounts, as H.R. 1224 does, or open de novo branches nationwide if the corporate owner of the ILC takes advantage of the special exemption in current law that allows the owner to operate outside the prudential framework that Congress has established for the corporate owners of other types of insured banks. ILCs are state-chartered FDIC-insured banks that were first established early in the twentieth century to make small loans to industrial workers. As insured banks, ILCs are supervised by the FDIC as well as by the chartering state. However, under a special exemption in current law, any type of company, including a commercial or retail firm, may acquire an ILC in a handful of states--principally Utah, California, and Nevada--and avoid the activity restrictions and supervisory requirements imposed on bank holding companies under the federal BHC Act. When the special exemption for ILCs was initially granted in 1987, ILCs were mostly small, local institutions that did not offer demand deposits or other types of checking accounts. In light of these facts, Congress conditioned the exemption on a requirement that any ILCs chartered after 1987 remain small (below $100 million in assets) or refrain from offering demand deposits that are withdrawable by check or similar means. This special exemption has been aggressively exploited since 1987. Some grandfathered states have allowed their ILCs to exercise many of the same powers as commercial banks and have begun to charter new ILCs. Today, several ILCs are owned by large, internationally active financial or commercial firms. In addition, a number of ILCs themselves have grown large, with one holding more than $50 billion in deposits and an additional eight holding more than $1 billion in deposits. Affirmatively granting ILCs the ability to offer business NOW accounts and open de novo branches across state lines would permit ILCs to become the functional equivalent of full-service insured banks and operate across the United States. This result would be inconsistent with both the historical functions of ILCs and the terms of their special exemption in current law. Because the parent companies of exempt ILCs are not subject to the BHC Act, authorizing ILCs to operate essentially as full-service banks would create an unlevel competitive playing field among banking organizations and undermine the framework Congress has established for the corporate owners of full-service banks. It would allow firms that are not subject to the consolidated supervisory framework of the BHC Act--including consolidated capital, examination, and reporting requirements--to own and control the functional equivalent of a full-service bank. It also would allow a foreign bank to acquire control of the equivalent of a full-service insured bank without meeting the requirement under the BHC Act that the foreign bank be subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis in its home country. In addition, it would allow financial firms to acquire the equivalent of a full-service bank without complying with the capital, managerial, and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requirements established by Congress in the GLB Act. Congress has established consolidated supervision as a fundamental component of bank supervision in the United States because consolidated supervision provides important protection to the insured banks that are part of a larger organization and to the federal safety net that supports those banks. Financial trouble in one part of an organization can spread rapidly to other parts. To protect an insured bank that is part of a larger organization, a supervisor needs to have the authority and tools to understand the risks that exist within the parent organization and its affiliates and, if necessary, address any significant capital, managerial, or other deficiencies before they pose a danger to the bank. This is particularly true today, as holding companies increasingly manage their operations--and the risks that arise from these operations--in a centralized manner that cuts across legal entities. Risks that cross legal entities and that are managed on a consolidated basis simply cannot be monitored properly through supervision directed at one, or even several, of the legal entities within the overall organization. For these reasons, Congress since 1956 has required that the parent companies of full-service insured banks be subject to consolidated supervision under the BHC Act. In addition, following the collapse of Bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI), Congress has required that foreign banks seeking to acquire control of a U.S. bank under the BHC Act be subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis in the foreign bank's home country. Authorizing exempt ILCs to operate as essentially full-service banks also would undermine the framework that Congress has established--and recently reaffirmed in the GLB Act--to limit the affiliation of banks and commercial entities. This is because any type of company, including a commercial firm, may own an exempt ILC without regard to the activity restrictions in the BHC Act that are designed to maintain the separation of banking and commerce. While H.R. 1224 attempts to address concerns related to mixing banking and commerce by placing certain limits on the types of ILCs that could offer business NOW accounts, the limits in H.R. 1224 do not adequately address this issue. For example, H.R. 1224 would allow any ILC that received FDIC insurance before October 1, 2003, or had an application for deposit insurance pending on that date, to offer NOW accounts to business customers so long as the institution does not experience a change in control. Thus, the bill would allow the commercial and retail firms that acquired an ILC before October 1, 2003, to transform the institution into the functional equivalent of a full-service insured bank. The bill also would allow any ILC that was established or acquired after October 1, 2003, to offer business NOW accounts so long as the ILC's appropriate state supervisor determined that the companies controlling the ILC derived at least 85 percent of their annual gross revenues from activities that are "financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity." Importantly, the bill does not define these terms by reference to the GLB Act or otherwise establish any standards for a state authority to use in determining what activities are "financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity." Instead, the bill leaves this important determination--which has the potential to undermine the nation's longstanding policy of maintaining the separation of banking and commerce--to the discretion of the ILC's state supervisor. Moreover, unlike the grandfather provisions of the GLB Act on which the ILC provisions of the bill purportedly are based ( see 12 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 1843(n)), H.R. 1224 would not require a company that acquires an ILC after October 1, 2003, to divest its non-financial, commercial activities within a specified period of time. The limits contained in H.R. 1224 also do not address the other risks and issues presented by ILCs. For example, the bill fails to address the supervisory issues associated with allowing domestic firms or foreign banks that are not subject to consolidated supervision to own and control the functional equivalent of a full-service insured bank. Let me be clear. The Board does not oppose granting ILCs the ability to offer business NOW accounts or open de novo branches if the corporate owners of ILCs engaged in these expanded activities are covered by the same supervisory and regulatory framework that applies to the owners of other full-service insured banks. Stated simply, if ILCs want to benefit from expanded powers and become functionally indistinguishable from other insured banks, then they and their corporate parents should be subject to the same rules that apply to the owners of other full-service insured banks. The Board believes that important principles governing the structure of the nation's banking system--such as consolidated supervision, the separation of banking and commerce, and the maintenance of a level playing field for all competitors in the financial services marketplace--should not be abandoned without careful consideration by the Congress. In the Board's view, legislation concerning the payment of interest on demand deposits or de novo branching is unlikely to provide an appropriate vehicle for the thorough consideration of the consequences of altering these key principles. Conclusion I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the Board's legislative suggestions and priorities concerning regulatory relief. The Board would be pleased to work with the Subcommittee, the full Committee, and their staffs as you move forward in developing and considering regulatory relief legislation. Appendix Regulatory Relief Proposals Supported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 1. Authorize the Federal Reserve to pay interest on balances held at Reserve Banks* Amendment gives the Federal Reserve explicit authority to pay interest on balances held by depository institutions at the Federal Reserve Banks. 2. Grant the Board additional flexibility in establishing reserve requirements* Amendment provides the Federal Reserve with greater flexibility to set the ratio of reserves that a depository institution must maintain against its transaction accounts below the current ranges established by the Monetary Control Act of 1980. 3. Authorize depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits* Amendment repeals the provisions in current law that prohibit depository institutions from paying interest on demand deposits. If adopted, the amendment would allow all depository institutions that have the authority to offer demand deposits to pay interest on those deposits. 4. Ease restrictions on interstate branching and mergers in a competitively equitable manner Amendment affirmatively authorizes national and state banks to open de novo branches on an interstate basis. Currently, banks may establish de novo branches in a new state only if the state has affirmatively authorized de novo branching. This existing limitation places banks at a disadvantage to federal savings associations, which currently have the ability to branch de novo on an interstate basis. The amendment also would remove a parallel provision that allows states to impose a minimum requirement on the age of banks that are acquired by an out-of-state banking organization. The amendment would not allow industrial loan companies (ILCs) that operate under a special exemption in federal law from opening de novo branches on a nationwide basis. The corporate owners of these ILCs are not subject to the type of consolidated supervision and activities restrictions that generally apply to the corporate owners of other banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Granting exempt ILCs nationwide branching rights also would be inconsistent with the terms of their special exemption in federal law. 5. Small Bank Examination Flexibility Amendment would expand the number of small institutions that may qualify for an eighteen-month (rather than a twelve-month) examination cycle. Under current law, an insured depository institution must have $250 million or less in total assets to qualify for an eighteen-month examination cycle. See 12 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 1820(d). The amendment would raise this asset cap to $500 million, thereby potentially allowing approximately an additional 1,100 institutions to qualify for an extended examination cycle. 6. Permit the Board to grant exceptions to the attribution rule concerning shares held by a trust for the benefit of a bank holding company or its shareholders or employees* The amendment would allow the Board, in appropriate circumstances, to waive the attribution rule in section 2(g)(2) of the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act). This attribution rule currently provides that, for purposes of the BHC Act, a company is deemed in all circumstances to own or control any shares that are held by a trust (such as an employee benefit plan) for the benefit of the company or its shareholders or employees. The amendment would allow the Board to waive the rule when, for example, the shares in question are held by a 401(k) plan that is widely held by the bank holding company's employees and the bank holding company does not have the ability to control the shares held by the plan. 7. Modification of the cross-marketing restrictions applicable to merchant banking and insurance company investments* Amendment allows the depository institution subsidiaries of a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with portfolio companies that are held under the merchant banking authority in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act) to the same extent as such activities are currently permissible for portfolio companies held under the GLB Act's insurance company investment authority. The amendment also would allow the depository institution subsidiaries of a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with a portfolio company held under either the merchant banking or insurance company investment authority if the financial holding company does not control the portfolio company. 8. Allow insured banks to engage in interstate merger transactions with savings associations and trust companies* The amendment would allow an insured bank to directly acquire, by merger, an insured savings association or uninsured trust company in a different home state without first converting the target savings association or trust company into an insured bank. As under current law, the insured bank would have to be the survivor of the merger. 9. Authorize member banks to use pass-through reserve accounts* Amendment permits banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System to count as reserves the deposits in other banks that are "passed through" by those banks to the Federal Reserve as required reserve balances. Nonmember banks already are able to use such pass-through reserve accounts. 10. Shorten the post-approval waiting period for bank mergers and acquisitions where the relevant banking agency and the Attorney General agree the transaction will not have adverse competitive effects Amendment allows the responsible federal banking agency, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, to reduce the post-approval waiting periods under the Bank Merger Act and BHC Act from fifteen days to as few as five days. The amendment would not alter the time period that a private party has to challenge a banking agency's approval of a transaction for reasons related to the Community Reinvestment Act. 11. Eliminate requirement that the reviewing agency request a competitive factors report from the other banking agencies in Bank Merger Act transactions* Amendment would eliminate the requirement that the reviewing agency request a competitive factors report from the other banking agencies on Bank Merger Act transactions. The reviewing agency would, however, continue to be required to (i) conduct a competitive analysis of the proposed merger, and (ii) request a competitive factors report from the Attorney General and provide a copy of this request to the FDIC (when the FDIC is not the reviewing agency). 12. Streamline Bank Merger Act procedural requirements for transactions involving entities that are already under common control The amendment eliminates the need for the reviewing agency for a bank merger involving affiliated entities to request a report on the competitive factors associated with the transaction from the other banking agencies and the Attorney General. The amendment also would eliminate the post-approval waiting period for Bank Merger Act transactions involving affiliated entities. The merger of depository institutions that already are under common control typically does not have any impact on competition. 13. a. Restore Board's authority to determine that new activities are "closely related to banking" and permissible for all bank holding companies Amendment would restore the Board's ability to determine that nonbanking activities are "closely related to banking" under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act and, thus, permissible for all bank holding companies, including those that have not elected to become financial holding companies. Bank holding companies would still have to become a financial holding company to engage in the types of expanded activities authorized by the GLB Act--including full-scope securities underwriting, insurance underwriting, and merchant banking activities--as well as any new activities that the Board determines are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activities under the GLB Act. b. Allow bank holding companies to engage in insurance agency activities (Alternative to Item 13.a.) Alternative amendment would allow all bank holding companies, including those that have not elected to become financial holding companies, to act as agent in the sale of insurance. Currently, bank holding companies that do not become a financial holding company may engage only in very limited insurance sales activities (primarily involving credit-related insurance). However, most banks are permitted to sell any type of insurance, either directly or through a subsidiary. The amendment would rectify this imbalance by permitting all bank holding companies to act as agent in the sale of insurance. Insurance agency activities involve less risk than insurance underwriting and other principal activities. Bank holding companies would continue to be required to become a financial holding company to engage in insurance underwriting activities. 14. Repeal certain reporting requirements imposed on the insiders of insured depository institutions* Amendment repeals the provisions of current law that require: (i) an executive officer of a bank to file a report with the bank's board of directors concerning the officer's indebtedness to other banks; (ii) a member bank to file a separate report each quarter concerning any loans made to its executive officers during the quarter; and (iii) executive officers and principal shareholders of a bank to report to the bank's board of directors any loans received from a correspondent bank. The Board has found that these reporting requirements do not contribute significantly to the monitoring of insider lending. These amendments would not alter the statutory limits or conditions imposed on loans by bank to their insiders. 15. Provide an adjustment for the small depository institutions exception under the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act (DIMIA)* Currently, the DIMIA generally prohibits a management official of one institution from serving as a management official of any other non-affiliated depository institution or depository institution holding company if the institutions or an affiliate of such institutions have offices that are located in the same metropolitan statistical area. The statute provides an exception from this restriction for institutions that have less than $20 million in assets, but this dollar figure has not been updated since 1978. The amendment would increase this amount to $200 million. 16. Flood insurance amendments These amendments would: (a) Allow lenders to rely on information from licensed surveyors to determine whether a property is in a flood zone, if the flood map is more than ten years old; (b) Increase the "small loan" exception to the flood insurance requirements from $5,000 to $20,000 and adjust this amount periodically based on changes in the Consumer Price Index; (c) Reduce the forty-five-day waiting period required after policy expiration before a lender can "force place" flood insurance by fifteen days to coincide with the thirty-day grace period during which flood insurance coverage continues after policy expiration, which would better enable lenders to avoid gaps in coverage on the relevant collateral; and (d) Give the federal banking agencies discretion to impose civil money penalties on institutions found to have engaged in a pattern or practice of violating the flood insurance requirements. 17. Periodic interagency review of Call Reports Amendment requires that the federal banking agencies jointly review the Call Report forms at least once every five years to determine if some of the information required by the reports may be eliminated. The federal banking agencies would retain their current authority to determine what information must be included in the Call Reports filed by the institutions under their primary supervision. 18. Ensure protection of confidential information received from foreign supervisory authorities* Amendment ensures that a federal banking agency may keep confidential information received from a foreign regulatory or supervisory authority if public disclosure of the information would violate the laws of the foreign country, and the banking agency obtained the information in connection with the administration and enforcement of federal banking laws or under a memorandum of understanding between the authority and the agency. The amendment would not authorize an agency to withhold information from Congress or in response to a court order in an action brought by the United States or the agency. 19. Restricting the ability of convicted individuals to participate in the affairs of a bank holding company or Edge Act or agreement corporation Amendment would prohibit a person convicted of a criminal offense involving dishonesty, breach of trust, or money laundering from participating in the affairs of a bank holding company (other than a foreign bank) or an Edge Act or agreement corporation without the consent of the Board. The amendment also would provide the Board with greater discretion to prevent convicted individuals from participating in the affairs of a nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding company. 20. Clarify application of section 8(i) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act* Amendment clarifies that a federal banking agency may take enforcement action against a person for conduct that occurred during his or her affiliation with a banking organization even if the person resigns from the organization, regardless of whether the enforcement action is initiated through a notice or an order.

Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies At the North Carolina Bankers Association 109th Annual Convention, Kiawah Island, South Carolina June 14, 2005 Current Regulatory Issues I would like to thank the North Carolina Bankers Association for inviting me to participate today in the annual convention. I want to discuss four regulatory issues that I know are of great interest to bankers in the audience today: sound practices for managing credit risk, particularly in residential and commercial real estate; compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act; recently issued guidance on overdraft protection; and progress on implementing new minimum regulatory capital requirements under the Basel framework, while updating the current Basel I framework. Credit Risk Credit risk has been the leading cause of bank failures over the years and remains the biggest risk for most financial institutions. Of course, credit performance has been very strong lately, and banks of all sizes survived the 2001 recession with only a slight decline in credit quality. Commercial-loan demand has rebounded and consumer lending, particularly mortgage financing, has been brisk. But as the real estate lending cycle matures and lender competition increases, banking supervisors tend to worry. In particular, in the commercial and residential real estate sectors, we worry that borrowers could become increasingly speculative, buying beyond their means and hoping for asset price appreciation--whether they are buying for their own use or strictly for the sake of investment. We worry that competitive pressures could drive banks to lower their underwriting standards, implicitly encouraging such speculation. And we worry that, in the inevitable downturn, credit quality could deteriorate to the extent that some banks could experience significant losses. The residential real estate sector has been experiencing a remarkable bull market, with home prices rising 11.2 percent last year--the fastest rate in more than a quarter-century. Along with the high home prices, we see indications that underwriting standards are beginning to weaken. For example, "affordability products"--such as interest-only loans, negative amortizations, and second mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios--are becoming more popular; subprime lending is growing faster than prime lending; adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, have grown substantially and now account for more than a third of all mortgage originations, the highest level since 1994. Industry experts are increasingly concerned about the quality of collateral valuations relied upon in home equity lending and residential refinancing activities. More homes are being purchased not as primary dwellings, but as vacation homes or pure investments, in which case anticipated price appreciation may be a large factor influencing purchase decisions. According to the National Association of Realtors, purchases of second homes and purchases of residential real estate for investment purposes together accounted for almost 40 percent of all home purchases last year. Given the vast growth in residential housing markets and the apparent slippage in underwriting standards in certain sectors, it is entirely appropriate for banking supervisors to seek to ensure that banks are employing proper risk-management practices. Last month, the federal banking agencies released guidance on credit-risk management for financial institutions' home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). The recent growth in HELOCs has been remarkable; at the end of 2004, outstanding drawn HELOCs at all insured commercial banks totaled $398 billion, a 40 percent increase over 2003. Meanwhile, the agencies have observed some easing of underwriting standards, with lenders competing to attract home equity lending business. Lenders are sometimes offering interest-only loans and are sometimes requiring very small down payments and limited documentation of a borrower's assets and income. They are also relying more on automated-valuation models and entering into more transactions with loan brokers and other third parties. Given this easing of standards, there is concern that portions of banks' home equity loan portfolios may be vulnerable to a rise in interest rates and a decline in home values. In other words, there is concern that not all banks fully recognize the embedded risks in some of their portfolios. But supervisors believe that, like most other lending activity, home equity lending can be conducted in a safe and sound manner with appropriate risk-management systems. Bank supervisors today have similar concerns about commercial real estate lending, defined as those real estate loans in which the primary source of repayment is derived from the rental income or sale proceeds of commercial property. This has historically been a highly volatile asset class, and it played a central role in the banking problems of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Federal Reserve staff is currently considering supervisory guidance on sound risk-management practices for commercial real estate exposures, with the goal of issuing the guidance on an interagency basis. Banking supervisors are carefully monitoring rising commercial real estate concentrations at some banking organizations. At banks with high concentrations, bank supervisors expect risk-management practices, underwriting standards, and capital levels to keep pace with loan growth. During previous downturns in the credit cycle, banks with high commercial real estate concentrations suffered significant losses. Smaller banks as a group have shown the strongest appetite for commercial real estate loans, and some claim that commercial real estate lending remains one of the few areas in which small banks can effectively compete with their larger competitors. So far, underwriting standards are high by historic standards, and much higher than in the period preceding the earlier crises. Still, we have recently seen signs that standards may be under some downward pressure as a result of strong competition and tight spreads. I want to touch on one final topic related to credit risk. In March, the federal regulators issued for public comment a proposal to change the supervisory framework for the classification of problem loans. The current system dates back to 1938 and has undergone only minor revisions reflecting evolutionary changes in banking practices. The proposal would replace the current classified commercial loan categories--"special mention," "substandard," and "doubtful"--with a framework consisting of two parts: a borrower evaluation (to assess the risk of the borrower defaulting on its obligations) and a facility rating (to measure the severity of the loss the bank would likely incur in the event of default). We believe the proposed new system is more compatible with financial institutions' allowance for loan and lease loss methodologies and rating-assessment processes. The new system leverages off of the determinations and estimates banks already must make to comply with generally accepted accounting principles, which means that banks should benefit from a more-efficient assessment process and improved clarity. We also believe the new system would increase consistency among the agencies in assessing the credit risk in a bank's commercial loan portfolio. Although the proposal only recently went out for public comment, we have heard so far that some industry representatives believe that the proposal represents an effort to implement Basel II in disguise and that it imposes too much of a burden on financial institutions. It's useful to remember that the loan-classification system applies to only a relatively small portion of a bank's portfolio. What we are proposing is good risk management and an improved system that, if implemented properly, can produce more consistency both between bank and supervisory practices and across regulatory agencies. In addition, if this framework is implemented, we intend to allow for an extended transition period to minimize the potential burden and cost of changing to a new system. The comment period ends on June 30, and we will review the public comments carefully. Bank Secrecy Act Another issue of importance to bankers is the Bank Secrecy Act. We in Washington fully appreciate that a few high-profile companies have drawn considerable public attention to the issue of compliance with this act and that expectations for compliance are not limited to very large institutions. You too are bearing the burden of new statutes and regulations and the costs of implementing effective compliance programs. But we must recognize and accept that the environment changed on September 11, 2001. At the same time, I want to assure you that the approach taken by the Fed and the other federal banking agencies is not one of zero tolerance and that supervisors do not issue enforcement actions against banking organizations because they have failed to file a single suspicious activity report. On the contrary, we continue to expect examiners to use their best judgment and to look for systematic weaknesses in programs, policies, procedures, and internal controls. Interagency efforts are now under way to develop and issue a new, uniform Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual . The targeted release date is June 30, 2005. The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking supervisors, with the active participation of FinCEN--the entity within the U.S. Treasury that is statutorily responsible for the implementation of the Bank Secrecy Act--are now drafting the new compliance guidance and examination procedures. As part of the rollout of the new BSA/AML Examination Manual, nationwide conference calls and regional outreach meetings will be held for bankers interested in understanding the procedures. Bankers are encouraged to participate in these voluntary sessions. We are also putting a great deal of effort into examiner training to promote consistency. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the other federal bank supervisory agencies signed a memorandum of understanding with FinCEN last year to share critical information about banking organizations' compliance with the law. By providing pertinent Bank Secrecy Act information to FinCEN, which is adding staff to fulfill its responsibilities, the Federal Reserve and the other regulators can now better coordinate their supervision with FinCEN, thus further reducing the potential for unwarranted compliance burdens on the industry. The bottom line is that any bank of any size should always be on guard for suspicious activities, and whenever they know, suspect, or have reason to suspect a violation of law, they should file suspicious activity reports according to Federal Reserve and FinCEN regulations. Bankers must practice enough due diligence to know when a transaction is suspicious--for instance, if it has no business purpose or if it seems structured to get around Bank Secrecy Act regulations. On a related matter, in April the agencies issued guidance on money-services businesses, or MSBs, and how to handle them. The concern among bankers, which may result in part from misconceptions about the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, was that they were being held responsible for monitoring the activities of their customers. We hope that our guidance will reassure financial institutions that it is not our view that all money services firms present an unacceptably high risk of money laundering or other illegal activities, that we are not instructing banks to close MSB accounts, and that we do not expect banks to regulate MSBs. Guidance on Overdraft Protection Another supervisory concern that I would like to talk about today is the service, increasingly being offered by some financial institutions, known as "bounced-check protection" or "overdraft protection." This is a type of credit service that may be offered to both consumer and small-business customers in place of traditional overdraft-coverage service. In February, the Federal Reserve and the other federal supervisors issued joint guidance highlighting various aspects of the marketing, disclosure, and implementation of some overdraft-protection programs that raised concerns about both consumer protection and safety and soundness. From a safety-and-soundness perspective, the agencies are concerned that these programs may expose institutions to more credit risk than do more-traditional overdraft products. The guidance emphasizes prudent risk-management practices that financial institutions should follow with respect to the credit-risk aspects of overdraft programs. From a consumer protection perspective, the agencies are concerned that, because of the way these programs are marketed, consumers do not always understand how they compare with traditional lines of credit, and that in some cases consumers are being encouraged to overdraw their accounts to meet short-term borrowing needs. In May, the Federal Reserve issued final amendments to Regulation DD, which implements the Truth in Savings Act, to improve the uniformity and adequacy of information provided to consumers about overdrawing their deposit accounts. Among other things, the revisions to Regulation DD would require additional disclosures about fees and other terms for overdraft services, including in advertisements. Basel I Amendments Finally, as I'm sure you are aware, over the past several years bank regulators have been working at the international level to revise the Basel Accord, the risk-based capital framework. Capital adequacy is a perennial concern of bank supervisors. The proposed revisions, especially the advanced approaches of Basel II, represent a sea change in how banks determine their minimum level of required capital for regulatory purposes. The advanced approaches are intended to better align regulatory capital with inherent risks and banks' internal economic capital, and they will encourage large complex organizations to strengthen risk-measurement and -management systems. Of course, the more-advanced approaches of Basel II are clearly designed for large complex banks and will not be required for community banks or even for most regional banking organizations. U.S. regulators are very sensitive to the possible competitive implications of having two sets of rules for the banking industry. Some community bankers in particular have expressed concerns about the competitive impact of the Basel II capital accord on non-Basel II banks, particularly for residential mortgages and retail and small-business loans. Many community bankers are concerned about the minimum level of regulatory capital that Basel II banks will be required to hold. In response, the Federal Reserve has conducted a number of studies on whether Basel II will create significant market distortions for the vast majority of banking organizations that remain on Basel I. These studies have suggested that competitive impacts will be mild for some business lines, while for others, such as some types of small-business loans, it does appear that unintended competitive advantages and disadvantages might be created--depending in part on how Basel II is ultimately implemented in the United States. Where these concerns appear valid, we and the other federal banking agencies will propose remedies in the form of revisions to the current Basel I-based capital rules. It is our current intention to issue a proposal to revise the Basel I-based capital rules close to the same time that we issue the proposed rulemaking for Basel II. We would like to allow the banking community to compare and comment on both proposals, for the very reason that we are sensitive to the potential for competitive distortions. Moreover, as in the past, if competitive or other issues later arise that we cannot now foresee, the Federal Reserve will make appropriate adjustments to the rules. I want to make clear that, for the vast majority of banks here in the United States, I see no reason to replace the Basel I-based regulatory framework with a complex framework similar to advanced Basel II. The Basel I-based framework has evolved modestly over time in response to market developments and to address safety-and-soundness issues. With occasional modifications, the current risk-based capital regime should remain appropriate for most U.S. banking organizations for many years to come. It is also important for you to know that we supervisors will not look upon institutions as having deficient risk-management systems simply because they choose to stay under the Basel I capital framework. Our focus will continue to be on ensuring that risk-management processes are appropriate for operations of each institution and that those risk systems operate effectively. Thus, we expect that non-Basel II banks will continue to have CAMELS 1 and 2 ratings as long as they operate in a safe and sound manner. Note that Basel I and Basel II are not the only capital regulations under which U.S. institutions will operate. More than a decade ago, the Congress, as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act's prompt-corrective-action (PCA) regime, defined a critically undercapitalized insured depository institution by reference to a minimum tangible-equity-to-asset requirement--a leverage ratio. The agencies have also used leverage ratios to define other PCA capital categories because experience has suggested that there is no substitute for an adequate equity-to-asset ratio, especially for entities that face the moral hazard that accompanies the federal safety net. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is responsible to the Congress for the management of the critical deposit-insurance portion of the safety net, has underlined the importance of that minimum leverage ratio and PCA as part of a prudent supervisory regime. The Federal Reserve concurs with the FDIC's view. As I have mentioned, we need the risk-measurement and -management infrastructure and the risk sensitivity of Basel II, but we also need the supplementary assurance of a minimum equity base. Meanwhile, even if supervisors did not call for a minimum leverage ratio, I firmly believe that bankers, investors, and rating agencies would demand it. This leverage ratio would be the same under the amended Basel I framework as it would be under the Basel II framework. Conclusion In conclusion, I would like to say that we at the Federal Reserve understand the depth and complexity of the issues that banks face today, from capital to credit-risk to compliance issues. As bankers, you are well aware of how important it is to modify your products and services to meet changing customer needs and the evolving competitive landscape. As is the case with the issues I described today, it is also important that banks' risk-management practices, and internal controls--as well as bank supervisory policies--continue to adapt to support changes in business practices.

Remarks by Governor Donald L. Kohn At the BankerÂ’s Association for Finance and Trade and Institute of International Bankers Conference, New York, New York June 15, 2005 Managing Risk in a Changing Economic and Financial Landscape I am pleased to lead off what promises to be a very interesting conference. As I thought about the conference title--"Charting a Course for the Future"--it struck me that, since one can never really know what the future will bring, charting specific paths to preconceived destinations is of limited value. To be sure, we make our best forecasts and base our actions on them. But perhaps the most important thing we can do--as managers of financial institutions, as regulators, and as monetary policymakers--is to develop systems for our actions and reactions that can accommodate the unexpected--that is, we can become better managers of risk. The evolution of financial markets and institutions has greatly affected the process of risk management. The means of managing risk have broadened dramatically, but the resulting systems could well be challenged by developments over coming years. I would like to take a few minutes this morning to ruminate on the changes in financial systems and their implications for risk management, the possibility that developments in our macroeconomic landscape might test these systems, and the steps you as private participants, and we as public policymakers, have been taking to raise the odds on preserving healthy financial systems and economies when the unexpected inevitably occurs. The Changing Financial Landscape Change in financial markets over the past decade or so has been rapid and profound. New computing and telecommunication technologies, along with the removal of legal and regulatory barriers to entry, have resulted in greater competition among a wider variety of institutions, in broader geographic areas, and across an expanding array of instruments. The result has been an increase in the efficiency with which financial markets channel funds from savers to spenders and an improvement in the ability of both savers and spenders to adjust their risk profiles. Among the key technological innovations are those that have enabled the development of databases critical to pricing and managing the risks of financial instruments. The ability to value risky assets laid the foundation for understanding the risks embedded in those assets and managing those risks on a portfolio basis. The evolution of financial markets has meant that more people and institutions have a greater number of alternatives for supplying or acquiring funds. In addition, both lenders and borrowers have a much wider range of instruments from which to choose the risk profile of their financial positions and to adjust that profile in response to changes in their own situations or in the overall financial and economic environment. Innovation and competition have substantially increased the role of markets relative to banks and other traditional providers of financial intermediation services. This has helped reduce the cost of transferring savings from anywhere around the globe into investment anywhere around the globe. It has also reduced the reliance of particular classes of borrowers and lenders on particular types of financial intermediaries. But it has also challenged you as bankers to identify the value you add to the intermediation process, and some of the new instruments and techniques we see have resulted from your attempting to exploit your comparative advantage. These changes have created the potential for more-robust financial markets, but in practice these shifts have not been without difficulties. Some significant disturbances in the past decade have challenged market participantsÂ’ and regulatorsÂ’ understanding of risk and revealed weaknesses in risk-management tools and practices. For example, in 1997 and 1998, capital flows to a number of Asian countries were disrupted, with severe effects on their economies. In 1998, the global financial system was rocked by the Russian debt default and the troubles of Long-Term Capital Management and its imitators. Those events were followed by the worst excesses of the stock market bubble, including not only the overvaluation of many stocks, but also the lapses in corporate governance that marked that era. Still, for most industrialized economies the macroeconomic fallout from the sharp decline in equity prices, from the spike in risk premiums and business distress, and from the revelations of corporate wrongdoing of a few years ago has been limited; in the United States, we experienced a mild recession. The effects have been limited in part because the financial system has proven reasonably resilient to these developments. Since the fall of 1998, we have not seen the kind of widespread uncertainty about the health of major players in financial markets that has in the past tended to intensify and spread the economic effect of adverse events. In my view, two basic reasons account for this relatively favorable outcome. First, risks probably are in fact better diversified and better allocated to those who are prepared to absorb them or to those whose financial distress is less likely to have feed-through effects on the economy. Second, monetary policy in the United States responded very aggressively to incipient declines in activity and inflation that resulted from the emerging problems. My message this morning, however, is that this is not a time for complacency. Financial-market innovations, some of which have not yet been rigorously stress tested, along with a macroeconomic environment that, while most likely stable and constructive, contains significant uncertainty, suggest that vigilance and adaptation by both market participants and regulators will be necessary to improve the odds of sustaining this era of damped economic cycles and supporting the orderly evolution of financial markets. The Macroeconomic Environment Changes in financial intermediation and markets may have helped contain the transmission of shocks from the financial sector to the real economy, but the evolution of financial markets in turn probably has been facilitated by favorable economic conditions. Business cycles have been damped since the early 1980s, and inflation has been low and steady in the United States and many other industrial economies for some time. As I just noted, this pattern has persisted through the past few years despite several major shocks, from the bursting of the tech stock bubble through the terrorist attacks. Stable economic environments encourage innovation; indeed fostering a stable economic environment is an important way in which central banks can contribute to public welfare. I do not anticipate any break in the pattern of generally favorable economic performance over coming years. Most economic forecasts are for moderate growth and low inflation in the United States for the foreseeable future. To be sure, we see a range of views about just how much underlying strength the economy has, about the intensity of any inflation pressures, and about the path of interest rates that will be associated with continued growth and low inflation. But for the most part, that range is narrow relative to the actual fluctuations the U.S. economy experienced in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The fundamentals, such as growth and inflation expectations and underlying financial conditions, appear to support continued good economic outcomes. Moreover, the flexibility and resilience of markets for finance and for goods and services, together with monetary policy focused on maintaining price stability and high employment, should help damp the economic fallout from unexpected developments. However, although the most likely outcome for the overall economy is good, a number of characteristics of the current situation suggest some greater-than-usual risks around that central tendency, and, in particular, raise questions about the pattern of asset price movements that might accompany even favorable overall economic performance. That caution flows from the existence of some unusual imbalances in the U.S. economy today. We are buying far more than we produce, and the extra purchases come from importing more than we export, financed by net borrowing from abroad. The resulting current account deficit has risen to a record level, in excess of 6 percent of gross domestic product. The counterpart of the current account deficit is low savings generated here at home; in the past year, household saving out of current income fell to the unusually low level of about 1 percent. Several factors have contributed to the willingness of households to spend most of their income, but an important one has been the rapid and continuing rise in housing prices, which has boosted household net worth. That rise in turn probably reflects several influences, one of which has been low long-term interest rates. These imbalances and unusual asset price configurations have persisted for some time. The current account deficit has grown steadily since the mid-1990s; household saving rates have been on a downward trajectory for even longer; the low level of long-term interest rates and the rapid pace of house price increases have been the subject of much commentary for the past few years. These phenomena could well continue for some time longer, but they are not sustainable indefinitely. At some point, global investors will require higher expected rates of return as their portfolios become increasingly concentrated in dollar assets; house price increases will encounter resistance as they rise relative to income and rents; as housing prices level out, households will recognize that they must increase saving out of income to have adequate resources for retirement; and the Federal Reserve already has been raising short-term interest rates as demand recovers from the shocks of recent years. I expect that the adjustment to more-sustainable patterns of spending and production and saving will occur in an orderly manner. The response of asset markets to changing attitudes and appetites will induce gradual adjustments in spending. But as you think about your risk-management challenges over coming years, you need to keep in mind that our economy is in unexplored territory in many respects. Historic patterns of movements in interest rates, exchange rates, and house prices may not be very good guides to future relationships. Who would have anticipated that the dollar would strengthen in 2001 as the Federal Reserve eased aggressively or that long-term interest rates would fall as we gradually reduced monetary accommodation over the past year? Even orderly adjustments may involve new combinations of market developments. And the risk of rapid adjustments and unusual configurations of asset price movements is higher than normal. Implications for Risk Management Financial institutions and public policymakers have demonstrated an ability to respond flexibly to changing circumstances over the past several years. But what does this imply about their ability to adapt to the conditions that they may confront in the future? Financial Institutions One of the defining characteristics of financial institutions and markets of late has been a significant expansion in the tools available for managing risk. These tools are tested and refined over time. Importantly, however, they rest on past experience and our understanding of events. Thus, as firms look ahead, they must be cognizant of the challenges that activities or events outside our experience pose for their risk management. New products and new business lines, for example, are an ongoing challenge. Historical data may be limited or not relevant for assessing risk in newly created products. Such data limitations affect even standard risk-management tools such as value-at-risk analysis. Recognizing the need to supplement standard risk-management tools, managers also routinely estimate their exposures under so-called tail events. Tail events, that is, asset price movements that are much more extreme than our usual experience, often appear driven by unique and idiosyncratic circumstances, so their implications are open to question and a challenge to risk managers. Should they be viewed as temporary deviations from a still-valid view of the usual distributions of possible outcomes, or are they a harbinger of a more permanent shift that suggests a need for re-assessment of risk-management models and practices? Tail events, by their nature, also are likely to be accompanied by heightened uncertainties. During such periods, the reaction of other market participants may become more relevant in the assessment of oneÂ’s own risk. Consider the management of market liquidity risk when asset prices are moving in unusual ways. A firm can no longer assume that it will be able to reduce its risk quickly by adjusting positions. Trades may be possible mostly at smaller volumes, and large trades almost surely will have greater price effects than normally observed. Other firms also may be trying to liquidate the same positions, creating further demands on diminished market liquidity. Risk management must take into account the potential for the longer holding periods and more-severe asset price movements likely to be observed in such conditions and the possibility of concentrations of positions in some markets. The challenges posed by tail events are not limited to market liquidity risk. They have broader effects on the measurement and management of market and counterparty credit risk, too. Managers of market risk typically mark positions to market and compute the value of positions under different assumptions about future price changes. During a tail event, wider bid-offer spreads are expected, reducing the accuracy of valuations of existing positions. More importantly, however, the dynamics of prices during tail events for individual assets and for assets in relation to each other likely are different from those observed in normal market conditions. This phenomenon raises questions about typical assessments of the likelihood of future changes in values. Managers of counterparty credit risk face still more challenges when considering tail events. Counterparties may be downgraded in ordinary times, and firms are familiar with the management of this risk. But when contemplating more-unusual movements of asset prices, a firm must also consider the degree of correlation between default probabilities and exposures at default as well as the possibility of multiple, correlated downgrades. The financial landscape of the future will require institutions to continue to refine their risk-management techniques to better manage these and other challenges posed by tail events. As I noted earlier, we are in uncharted territory with respect to many aspects of our macroeconomic environment. Prudent risk managers recognize the potential for tail events and prepare for that possibility. Such preparations involve stress testing, that is, simulating the portfolioÂ’s behavior during extreme yet plausible events to determine if losses are acceptable in those conditions. It is sometimes hard to know what types of events to use in this testing, and the choice of events will, of course, be a function of the underlying portfolio. That said, the current imbalances, along with the unusual asset price movements of recent years and the investor behavior and expectations they reflect, offer clues to some of the extreme but plausible events that management should be considering. Prudent risk management does not stop with stress testing, however. To be meaningful, the results of stress testing should be part of managementÂ’s ongoing planning for future contingencies. Policymakers Public policymakers are partners of the private sector in this process to strengthen risk management, and by extension, to strengthen the financial system. A critical role of the policymaker, of course, is to ensure that the plumbing, or infrastructure, of markets is sound. Traded instruments afford the opportunity to assume (or hedge) a growing variety of exposures and are used by a growing variety of investors. In such an environment, it is critically important that the mechanisms for settling trades do not introduce unwarranted risk into the system. The public sector has been active in developing risk-management standards for securities settlement systems. This has been a joint effort of central banks and securities regulators, and it has included representatives of countries with developing financial markets in addition to Group of Ten countries. As cross-border investing has grown, the argument for common minimum standards has become compelling. But standards without implementation are worthless. Critical components of securities settlement systems in many jurisdictions, including the United States, are governed by private-sector users. Realization of the benefit of full implementation of these standards requires a partnership with the private sector. The supervisory process, too, has shifted toward a greater focus on risk management. A key goal of Basel II is to better align regulatory capital requirements with risk. In the process, firms have been given greater incentives to invest in more-sophisticated risk-management systems. The Federal Reserve and other supervisors of financial institutions have embraced a more risk-focused approach in the way they deploy their own resources. Perhaps the most important contribution of the Federal Reserve arises in its conduct of monetary policy. Our responsibility is to work to maintain a stable price level and economic environment. Your problems would be compounded many times over by a surge in inflation and economic instability. In our risk-management approach to monetary policy, we attempt to reduce the odds that our nation will experience damaging macroeconomic tail events. But our capabilities are limited; ultimately, we are working with only the overnight interest rate and we concentrate on the price level more generally, which may not always be compatible with the stability of the prices of particular assets. And, like you, we cannot reliably anticipate what will occur. All the more reason for both private parties and regulators to pay particular attention to possible sources of risk and stress over coming years. Footnotes The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Board. Pat White, of the BoardÂ’s staff, contributed to these remarks.
The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced the issuance of an Order of Prohibition against Frank G. Caton, previously branch manager of the former Farmers Bank of Maryland, Annapolis, Maryland. Mr. Caton, without admitting to any allegations, consented to the issuance of the Order based on his alleged participation in violations of law and breaches of fiduciary duty to the bank and its customers in connection with embezzlement of funds and falsification of the bank's books and records. A copy of the Order is attached.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced the approval of an application by Banco del Estado de Chile, Santiago, Chile, to establish a branch in New York, New York. Attached is the Order relating to this action.
Testimony of Governor Mark Olson Regulatory relief Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate June 21, 2005 Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on issues related to regulatory relief. The Board is aware of the current and growing regulatory burden that is imposed on this nationÂ’s banking organizations. Often this burden falls particularly hard on small institutions, which have fewer resources than their larger brethren. The Board strongly supports the efforts of Congress to review periodically the federal banking laws to determine whether they can be streamlined without compromising the safety and soundness of banking organizations, consumer protections, or other important objectives that Congress has established for the financial system. In 2003, at Chairman ShelbyÂ’s request, the Board provided the Committee with a number of legislative proposals that we believe are consistent with this goal. Since then, the Board has continued to work with the other federal banking agencies and your staffs on regulatory relief matters and the Board recently agreed to support several additional regulatory relief proposals. A summary of the proposals supported by the Board is included in the to my testimony. In my remarks, I will highlight the BoardÂ’s three highest priority proposals. These three proposals would allow the Federal Reserve to pay interest on balances held by depository institutions at Reserve Banks, provide the Board greater flexibility in setting reserve requirements, and permit depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits. These amendments would improve efficiency in the financial sector, assist small banks and small businesses, and enhance the Federal ReserveÂ’s toolkit for efficiently conducting monetary policy. I also will mention a few additional proposals that the Board supports and that would provide meaningful regulatory relief to banking organizations. The Board looks forward to working with Congress, our fellow banking agencies and other interested parties in developing and analyzing other potential regulatory relief proposals as the legislative process moves forward. For its part, the Board strives to review each of our regulations at least once every five years to identify those provisions that are out of date or otherwise unnecessary. The Board also has been an active participant in the ongoing regulatory review process being conducted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA). EGRPRA requires the federal banking agencies, at least once every ten years, to review and seek public comment on the burden associated with the full range of the agenciesÂ’ regulations that affect insured depository institutions. The Board and the other banking agencies are in the midst of the first ten-year review cycle, and I am pleased to report that we are on track to complete this process by the 2006 deadline. The agencies already have solicited comments on four broad categories of regulations--including those governing applications, activities, money laundering, and consumer protection in lending transactions--and have conducted outreach meetings throughout the country to encourage public participation in the EGRPRA process. In response to these efforts, the agencies have received comments from more than 1,000 entities and individuals on ways to reduce the regulatory burden on banking organizations. The Board will consider and incorporate the comments relevant to our regulations as we move forward with our own regulation review efforts. While the banking agencies can achieve some burden reductions through administrative action, Congress plays a critical role in the regulatory relief process. Many proposals to reduce regulatory burden require congressional action to implement. Moreover, the Congress has ultimate responsibility for establishing the overall regulatory framework for banking organizations, and through its actions Congress can ensure that regulatory relief is consistent with the framework it has established to maintain the safety and soundness of banking organizations and promote other important public policy goals. Interest on Reserves and Reserve Requirement Flexibility For the purpose of implementing monetary policy, the Board is obliged by law to establish reserve requirements on certain deposits held at depository institutions. By law, the Board currently must set the ratio of required reserves on transaction deposits above a certain threshold at between 8 and 14 percent. Because the Federal Reserve does not pay interest on the balances held at Reserve Banks to meet reserve requirements, depositories have an incentive to reduce their reserve balances to a minimum. To do so, they engage in a variety of reserve avoidance activities, including sweep arrangements that move funds from deposits that are subject to reserve requirements to deposits and money market investments that are not. These sweep programs and similar activities absorb real resources and therefore diminish the efficiency of our banking system. The BoardÂ’s proposed amendment would authorize the Federal Reserve to pay depository institutions interest on their required reserve balances. Paying interest on these required reserve balances would remove a substantial portion of the incentive for depositories to engage in reserve avoidance measures, and the resulting improvements in efficiency should eventually be passed through to bank borrowers and depositors. Besides required reserve balances, depository institutions also voluntarily hold two other types of balances in their Reserve Bank accounts--contractual clearing balances and excess reserve balances. A depository institution holds contractual clearing balances when it needs a higher level of balances than its required reserve balances in order to pay checks or make wire transfers out of its account at the Federal Reserve without incurring overnight overdrafts. Currently, such clearing balances do not earn explicit interest, but they do earn implicit interest in the form of credits that may be used to pay for Federal Reserve services, such as check clearing. Excess reserve balances are funds held by depository institutions in their accounts at Reserve Banks in excess of their required reserve and contractual clearing balances. Excess reserve balances currently do not earn explicit or implicit interest. The BoardÂ’s proposed amendment would authorize the Federal Reserve to pay explicit interest on contractual clearing balances and excess reserve balances, as well as required reserve balances. This authority would enhance the Federal ReserveÂ’s ability to efficiently conduct monetary policy, and would complement another of the BoardÂ’s proposed amendments, which would give the Board greater flexibility in setting reserve requirements for depository institutions. In order for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to conduct monetary policy effectively, it is important that a sufficient and predictable demand for balances at the Reserve Banks exist so that the System knows the volume of reserves to supply (or remove) through open market operations to achieve the FOMCÂ’s target federal funds rate. Authorizing the Federal Reserve to pay explicit interest on contractual clearing balances and excess reserve balances, in addition to required reserve balances, could potentially provide a demand for voluntary balances that would be stable enough for monetary policy to be implemented effectively through existing procedures without the need for required reserve balances. In these circumstances, the Board, if authorized, could consider reducing--or even eliminating--reserve requirements, thereby reducing a regulatory burden for all depository institutions, without adversely affecting the Federal ReserveÂ’s ability to conduct monetary policy. Having the authority to pay interest on excess reserves also could help mitigate potential volatility in overnight interest rates. If the Federal Reserve was authorized to pay interest on excess reserves, and did so, the rate paid would act as a minimum for overnight interest rates, because banks would not generally lend to other banks at a lower rate than they could earn by keeping their excess funds at a Reserve Bank. Although the Board sees no need to pay interest on excess reserves in the near future, and any movement in this direction would need further study, the ability to do so would be a potentially useful addition to the monetary toolkit of the Federal Reserve. The payment of interest on required reserve balances, or reductions in reserve requirements, would lower the revenues received by the Treasury from the Federal Reserve. The extent of the potential revenue loss, however, has fallen over the last decade as banks have increasingly implemented reserve-avoidance techniques. Paying interest on contractual clearing balances would primarily involve a switch to explicit interest from the implicit interest currently paid in the form of credits, and therefore would have essentially no net cost to the Treasury. Interest on Demand Deposits The Board also strongly supports repealing the statutory restrictions that currently prohibit depository institutions from paying interest on demand deposits. The BoardÂ’s proposed amendment would allow all depository institutions that have the legal authority to offer demand deposits to pay interest on those deposits. As I will explain a little later, however, the Board opposes amendments that would separately authorize industrial loan companies that operate outside the supervisory and regulatory framework established for other insured banks to offer, for the first time, interest bearing transaction accounts to business customers. Repealing the prohibition of interest on demand deposits would improve the overall efficiency of our financial sector and, in particular, should assist small banks in attracting and retaining business deposits. To compete for the liquid assets of businesses, banks have been compelled to set up complicated procedures to pay implicit interest on compensating balance accounts and they spend resources--and charge fees--for sweeping the excess demand deposits of businesses into money market investments on a nightly basis. Small banks, however, often do not have the resources to develop the sweep or other programs that are needed to compete for the deposits of business customers. Moreover, from the standpoint of the overall economy, the expenses incurred by institutions of all sizes to implement these programs are a waste of resources and would be unnecessary if institutions were permitted to pay interest on demand deposits directly. The costs incurred by banks in operating these programs are passed on, directly or indirectly, to their large and small business customers. Authorizing banks to pay interest on demand deposits would eliminate the need for these customers to pay for more costly sweep and compensating balance arrangements to earn a return on their demand deposits. The payment of interest on demand deposits would have no direct effect on federal revenues, as interest payments would be deductible for banks but taxable for the firms that received them. Some proposals, such as H.R. 1224--the Business Checking Freedom Act of 2005--which recently passed the House, would delay the effectiveness of the authorization of interest on demand deposits for two years. The Board believes that a short implementation delay of one year, or even less, would be in the best interest of the public and the efficiency of our financial sector. A separate provision of H.R. 1224 would, in effect, allow implicit interest to be paid on demand deposits without any delay through a new type of sweep arrangement, but this provision would not promote efficiency. It would allow banks to offer a reservable money market deposit account (MMDA) from which twenty-four transfers a month could be made to other accounts of the same depositor. Banks would be able to sweep balances from demand deposits into these MMDAs each night, pay interest on them, and then sweep them back into demand deposits the next day. This type of account would likely permit banks to pay interest on demand deposits more selectively than with direct interest payments. The twenty-four-transfer MMDA, which would be useful only during the transition period before direct interest payments were allowed, could be implemented at lower cost by banks already having sweep programs. However, other banks would face a competitive disadvantage and pressures to incur the cost of setting up this new program during the transition for the one-year interim period. Moreover, some businesses would not benefit from this MMDA. Hence, the Board does not advocate this twenty-four-transfer account. Small Bank Examination Flexibility The Board also supports an amendment that would expand the number of small institutions that qualify for an extended examination cycle. Federal law currently mandates that the appropriate federal banking agency conduct an on-site examination of each insured depository institution at least once every twelve months. The statute, however, permits institutions that have $250 million or less in assets and that meet certain capital, managerial, and other criteria to be examined on an eighteen-month cycle. As the primary federal supervisors for state-chartered banks, the Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) may alternate responsibility for conducting these examinations with the appropriate state supervisory authority if the Board or FDIC determines that the state examination carries out the purposes of the statute. The $250 million asset cutoff for an eighteen-month examination cycle has not been raised since 1994. The BoardÂ’s proposed amendment would raise this asset cap from $250 million to $500 million, thus potentially allowing approximately an additional 1,100 insured depository institutions to qualify for an eighteen-month examination cycle. The proposed amendment would provide meaningful relief to small institutions without jeopardizing the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions. Under the proposed amendment, an institution with less than $500 million in assets would qualify for the eighteen-month examination cycle only if the institution was well capitalized, well managed, and met the other criteria established by Congress in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. The amendment also would continue to require that all insured depository institutions undergo a full-scope, on-site examination at least once every twelve or eighteen months. Importantly, the agencies would continue to have the ability to examine any institution more frequently and at any time if the agency determines an examination is necessary or appropriate. Despite advances in off-site monitoring, the Board continues to believe that regular on-site examinations play a critical role in helping bank supervisors detect and correct asset, risk-management, or internal control problems at an institution before these problems result in claims on the deposit insurance funds. The mandatory twelve- or eighteen-month on-site examination cycle imposes important discipline on the federal banking agencies, ensures that insured depository institutions do not go unexamined for extended periods, and has contributed significantly to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions. For these reasons, the Board opposes alternative amendments that would allow an agency to indefinitely lengthen the exam cycle for any institution in order to allocate and conserve the agencyÂ’s examination resources. Permit the Board to Grant Exceptions to Attribution Rule The Board has proposed another amendment that we believe will help banking organizations maintain attractive benefits programs for their employees. The Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act) generally prohibits a bank holding company from owning, in the aggregate, more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any company without the BoardÂ’s approval. The BHC Act also provides that any shares held by a trust for the benefit of a bank holding companyÂ’s shareholders or employees are deemed to be controlled by the bank holding company itself. This attribution rule was intended to prevent a bank holding company from using a trust established for the benefit of its management, shareholders, or employees to evade the BHC Act's restrictions on the acquisition of shares of banks and nonbanking companies. While this attribution rule has proved to be a useful tool in preventing evasions of the BHC Act, it does not always provide an appropriate result. For example, it may not be appropriate to apply the attribution rule when the shares in question are acquired by a 401(k) plan that is widely held by, and operated for the benefit of, the employees of the bank holding company. In these situations, the bank holding company may not have the ability to influence the purchase or sale decisions of the employees or otherwise control the shares that are held by the plan in trust for its employees. The suggested amendment would allow the Board to address these situations by authorizing the Board to grant exceptions from the attribution rule where appropriate. Reduce Cross-Marketing Restrictions Another amendment proposed by the Board would modify the cross-marketing restrictions imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act) on the merchant banking and insurance company investments of financial holding companies. The GLB Act generally prohibits a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company from engaging in cross-marketing activities with a nonfinancial company that is owned by the same financial holding company under the GLB ActÂ’s merchant banking or insurance company investment authorities. However, the GLB Act currently permits a depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company, with Board approval, to engage in limited cross-marketing activities through statement stuffers and Internet websites with nonfinancial companies that are held under the actÂ’s insurance company investment authority (but not the actÂ’s merchant banking authority). The BoardÂ’s proposed amendment would allow depository institutions controlled by a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with companies held under the merchant banking authority to the same extent, and subject to the same restrictions, as companies held under the insurance company investment authority. We believe that this parity of treatment is appropriate, and see no reason to treat the merchant banking and insurance investments of financial holding companies differently for purposes of the cross-marketing restrictions of the GLB Act. A second aspect of the amendment would liberalize the cross-marketing restrictions that apply to both merchant banking and insurance company investments. This aspect of the amendment would permit a depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with a nonfinancial company held under either the merchant banking or insurance company investment authority if the nonfinancial company is not controlled by the financial holding company. When a financial holding company does not control a portfolio company, cross-marketing activities are unlikely to materially undermine the separation between the nonfinancial portfolio company and the financial holding companyÂ’s depository institution subsidiaries. Industrial Loan Companies As I noted earlier, the Board strongly supports allowing depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits. The Board, however, opposes proposals that would allow industrial loan companies (ILCs) to offer interest-bearing, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts to business customers if the corporate owner of the ILC takes advantage of the special exemption in current law that allows the owner to operate outside the prudential framework that Congress has established for the corporate owners of other types of insured banks. ILCs are state-chartered FDIC-insured banks that were first established early in the twentieth century to make small loans to industrial workers. As insured banks, ILCs are supervised by the FDIC as well as by the chartering state. However, under a special exemption in current law, any type of company, including a commercial or retail firm, may acquire an ILC in a handful of states--principally Utah, California, and Nevada--and avoid the activity restrictions and supervisory requirements imposed on bank holding companies under the federal BHC Act. When the special exemption for ILCs was initially granted in 1987, ILCs were mostly small, local institutions that did not offer demand deposits or other types of checking accounts. In light of these facts, Congress conditioned the exemption on a requirement that any ILCs chartered after 1987 remain small (below $100 million in assets) or refrain from offering demand deposits that are withdrawable by check or similar means. This special exemption has been aggressively exploited since 1987. Some grandfathered states have allowed their ILCs to exercise many of the same powers as commercial banks and have begun to charter new ILCs. Today, several ILCs are owned by large, internationally active financial or commercial firms. In addition, a number of ILCs themselves have grown large, with one holding more than $50 billion in deposits and an additional six holding more than $1 billion in deposits. Affirmatively granting ILCs the ability to offer business NOW accounts would permit ILCs to become the functional equivalent of full-service insured banks. This result would be inconsistent with both the historical functions of ILCs and the terms of their special exemption in current law. Because the parent companies of exempt ILCs are not subject to the BHC Act, authorizing ILCs to operate essentially as full-service banks would create an unlevel competitive playing field among banking organizations and undermine the framework Congress has established for the corporate owners of full-service banks. It would allow firms that are not subject to the consolidated supervisory framework of the BHC Act--including consolidated capital, examination, and reporting requirements--to own and control the functional equivalent of a full-service bank. It also would allow a foreign bank to acquire control of the equivalent of a full-service insured bank without meeting the requirement under the BHC Act that the foreign bank be subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis in its home country. In addition, it would allow financial firms to acquire the equivalent of a full-service bank without complying with the capital, managerial, and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requirements established by Congress in the GLB Act. Congress has established consolidated supervision as a fundamental component of bank supervision in the United States because consolidated supervision provides important protection to the insured banks that are part of a larger organization and to the federal safety net that supports those banks. Financial trouble in one part of an organization can spread rapidly to other parts. To protect an insured bank that is part of a larger organization, a supervisor needs to have the authority and tools to understand the risks that exist within the parent organization and its affiliates and, if necessary, address any significant capital, managerial, or other deficiencies before they pose a danger to the bank. This is particularly true today, as holding companies increasingly manage their operations--and the risks that arise from these operations--in a centralized manner that cuts across legal entities. Risks that cross legal entities and that are managed on a consolidated basis simply cannot be monitored properly through supervision directed at one, or even several, of the legal entities within the overall organization. For these reasons, Congress since 1956 has required that the parent companies of full-service insured banks be subject to consolidated supervision under the BHC Act. In addition, following the collapse of Bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI), Congress has required that foreign banks seeking to acquire control of a U.S. bank under the BHC Act be subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis in the foreign bankÂ’s home country. Authorizing exempt ILCs to operate as essentially full-service banks also would undermine the framework that Congress has established--and recently reaffirmed in the GLB Act--to limit the affiliation of banks and commercial entities. This is because any type of company, including a commercial firm, may own an exempt ILC without regard to the activity restrictions in the BHC Act that are designed to maintain the separation of banking and commerce. H.R. 1224 attempts to address the banking and commerce concerns raised by allowing ILCs to offer business NOW accounts by placing certain limits on the types of ILCs that may engage in these new activities. However, as Governor Kohn recently testified in the House on behalf of the Board, the limits contained in H.R. 1224 do not adequately address these concerns. Moreover, H.R. 1224 fails to address the supervisory issues associated with allowing domestic firms and foreign banks that are not subject to consolidated supervision to control the functional equivalent of a full-service insured bank. Let me be clear. The Board does not oppose granting ILCs the ability to offer business NOW accounts if the corporate owners of ILCs engaged in these expanded activities are covered by the same supervisory and regulatory framework that applies to the owners of other full-service insured banks. Stated simply, if ILCs want to benefit from expanded powers and become functionally indistinguishable from other insured banks, then they and their corporate parents should be subject to the same rules that apply to the owners of other full-service insured banks. For the same reasons discussed above, the Board opposes amendments that would allow exempt ILCs to open de novo branches throughout the United States. Affirmatively granting exempt ILCs the authority to offer business NOW accounts also is not necessary to ensure or provide parity among insured banks. The BoardÂ’s proposed amendment would allow all depository institutions that have the authority to offer demand deposits the ability to pay interest on those deposits. Thus, the BoardÂ’s proposed amendment would treat all depository institutions equally. Separately granting exempt ILCs the ability to offer the functional equivalent of a corporate demand deposit, on the other hand, would grant new and expanded powers to institutions that already benefit from a special exemption in current law. Far from promoting competitive equity, these proposals would promote competitive inequality in the financial marketplace. The Board believes that important principles governing the structure of the nationÂ’s banking system--such as consolidated supervision, the separation of banking and commerce, and the maintenance of a level playing field for all competitors in the financial services marketplace--should not be abandoned without careful consideration by the Congress. In the BoardÂ’s view, legislation concerning the payment of interest on demand deposits is unlikely to provide an appropriate vehicle for the thorough consideration of the consequences of altering these key principles. Conclusion I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the BoardÂ’s legislative suggestions and priorities concerning regulatory relief. The Board would be pleased to work with the Committee and your staffs as you seek to develop and advance meaningful regulatory relief legislation that is consistent with the nationÂ’s public policy objectives. Appendix Regulatory Relief Proposals Supported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 1. Authorize the Federal Reserve to pay interest on balances held at Reserve Banks Amendment gives the Federal Reserve explicit authority to pay interest on balances held by depository institutions at the Federal Reserve Banks. 2. Grant the Board additional flexibility in establishing reserve requirements Amendment provides the Federal Reserve with greater flexibility to set the ratio of reserves that a depository institution must maintain against its transaction accounts below the current ranges established by the Monetary Control Act of 1980. 3. Authorize depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits Amendment repeals the provisions in current law that prohibit depository institutions from paying interest on demand deposits. If adopted, the amendment would allow all depository institutions that have the authority to offer demand deposits to pay interest on those deposits. 4. Ease restrictions on interstate branching and mergers in a competitively equitable manner Amendment affirmatively authorizes national and state banks to open de novo branches on an interstate basis. Currently, banks may establish de novo branches in a new state only if the state has affirmatively authorized de novo branching. This existing limitation places banks at a disadvantage to federal savings associations, which currently have the ability to branch de novo on an interstate basis. The amendment also would remove a parallel provision that allows states to impose a minimum requirement on the age of banks that are acquired by an out-of-state banking organization. The amendment would not allow industrial loan companies (ILCs) that operate under a special exemption in federal law from opening de novo branches on a nationwide basis. The corporate owners of these ILCs are not subject to the type of consolidated supervision and activities restrictions that generally apply to the corporate owners of other banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Granting exempt ILCs nationwide branching rights also would be inconsistent with the terms of their special exemption in federal law. 5. Small Bank Examination Flexibility Amendment would expand the number of small institutions that may qualify for an eighteen-month (rather than a twelve-month) examination cycle. Under current law, an insured depository institution must have $250 million or less in total assets to qualify for an eighteen-month examination cycle. See 12 U.S.C. Â§ 1820(d). The amendment would raise this asset cap to $500 million, thereby potentially allowing approximately an additional 1,100 institutions to qualify for an extended examination cycle. 6. Permit the Board to grant exceptions to the attribution rule concerning shares held by a trust for the benefit of a bank holding company or its shareholders or employees The amendment would allow the Board, in appropriate circumstances, to waive the attribution rule in section 2(g)(2) of the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act). This attribution rule currently provides that, for purposes of the BHC Act, a company is deemed in all circumstances to own or control any shares that are held by a trust (such as an employee benefit plan) for the benefit of the company or its shareholders or employees. The amendment would allow the Board to waive the rule when, for example, the shares in question are held by a 401(k) plan that is widely held by the bank holding companyÂ’s employees and the bank holding company does not have the ability to control the shares held by the plan. 7. Modification of the cross-marketing restrictions applicable to merchant banking and insurance company investments Amendment allows the depository institution subsidiaries of a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with portfolio companies that are held under the merchant banking authority in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act) to the same extent as such activities are currently permissible for portfolio companies held under the GLB ActÂ’s insurance company investment authority. The amendment also would allow the depository institution subsidiaries of a financial holding company to engage in cross-marketing activities with a portfolio company held under either the merchant banking or insurance company investment authority if the financial holding company does not control the portfolio company. 8. Allow insured banks to engage in interstate merger transactions with savings associations and trust companies The amendment would allow an insured bank to directly acquire, by merger, an insured savings association or uninsured trust company in a different home state without first converting the target savings association or trust company into an insured bank. As under current law, the insured bank would have to be the survivor of the merger. 9. Authorize member banks to use pass-through reserve accounts Amendment permits banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System to count as reserves the deposits in other banks that are Â“passed throughÂ” by those banks to the Federal Reserve as required reserve balances. Nonmember banks already are able to use such pass-through reserve accounts. 10. Shorten the post-approval waiting period for bank mergers and acquisitions where the relevant banking agency and the Attorney General agree the transaction will not have adverse competitive effects Amendment allows the responsible federal banking agency, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, to reduce the post-approval waiting periods under the Bank Merger Act and BHC Act from fifteen days to as few as five days. The amendment would not alter the time period that a private party has to challenge a banking agencyÂ’s approval of a transaction for reasons related to the Community Reinvestment Act. 11. Eliminate requirement that the reviewing agency request a competitive factors report from the other banking agencies in Bank Merger Act transactions Amendment would eliminate the requirement that the reviewing agency request a competitive factors report from the other banking agencies on Bank Merger Act transactions. The reviewing agency would, however, continue to be required to (i) conduct a competitive analysis of the proposed merger, and (ii) request a competitive factors report from the Attorney General and provide a copy of this request to the FDIC (when the FDIC is not the reviewing agency). 12. Streamline Bank Merger Act procedural requirements for transactions involving entities that are already under common control The amendment eliminates the need for the reviewing agency for a bank merger involving affiliated entities to request a report on the competitive factors associated with the transaction from the other banking agencies and the Attorney General. The amendment also would eliminate the post-approval waiting period for Bank Merger Act transactions involving affiliated entities. The merger of depository institutions that already are under common control typically does not have any impact on competition. 13. a. Restore BoardÂ’s authority to determine that new activities are "closely related to banking" and permissible for all bank holding companies Amendment would restore the BoardÂ’s ability to determine that nonbanking activities are "closely related to banking" under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act and, thus, permissible for all bank holding companies, including those that have not elected to become financial holding companies. Bank holding companies would still have to become a financial holding company to engage in the types of expanded activities authorized by the GLB Act--including full-scope securities underwriting, insurance underwriting, and merchant banking activities--as well as any new activities that the Board determines are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activities under the GLB Act. b. Allow bank holding companies to engage in insurance agency activities (Alternative to Item 13.a.) Alternative amendment would allow all bank holding companies, including those that have not elected to become financial holding companies, to act as agent in the sale of insurance. Currently, bank holding companies that do not become a financial holding company may engage only in very limited insurance sales activities (primarily involving credit-related insurance). However, most banks are permitted to sell any type of insurance, either directly or through a subsidiary. The amendment would rectify this imbalance by permitting all bank holding companies to act as agent in the sale of insurance. Insurance agency activities involve less risk than insurance underwriting and other principal activities. Bank holding companies would continue to be required to become a financial holding company to engage in insurance underwriting activities. 14. Repeal certain reporting requirements imposed on the insiders of insured depository institutions Amendment repeals the provisions of current law that require: (i) an executive officer of a bank to file a report with the bankÂ’s board of directors concerning the officerÂ’s indebtedness to other banks; (ii) a member bank to file a separate report each quarter concerning any loans made to its executive officers during the quarter; and (iii) executive officers and principal shareholders of a bank to report to the bankÂ’s board of directors any loans received from a correspondent bank. The Board has found that these reporting requirements do not contribute significantly to the monitoring of insider lending. These amendments would not alter the statutory limits or conditions imposed on loans by bank to their insiders. 15. Provide an adjustment for the small depository institutions exception under the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act (DIMIA) Currently, the DIMIA generally prohibits a management official of one institution from serving as a management official of any other non-affiliated depository institution or depository institution holding company if the institutions or an affiliate of such institutions have offices that are located in the same metropolitan statistical area. The statute provides an exception from this restriction for institutions that have less than $20 million in assets, but this dollar figure has not been updated since 1978. The amendment would increase this amount to $100 million. 16. Flood insurance amendments These amendments would: (a) Allow lenders to rely on information from licensed surveyors to determine whether a property is in a flood zone, if the flood map is more than ten years old; (b) Increase the "small loan" exception to the flood insurance requirements from $5,000 to $20,000 and adjust this amount periodically based on changes in the Consumer Price Index; (c) Reduce the forty-five-day waiting period required after policy expiration before a lender can "force place" flood insurance by fifteen days to coincide with the thirty-day grace period during which flood insurance coverage continues after policy expiration, which would better enable lenders to avoid gaps in coverage on the relevant collateral; and (d) Give the federal banking agencies discretion to impose civil money penalties on institutions found to have engaged in a pattern or practice of violating the flood insurance requirements. 17. Periodic interagency review of Call Reports Amendment requires that the federal banking agencies jointly review the Call Report forms at least once every five years to determine if some of the information required by the reports may be eliminated. The federal banking agencies would retain their current authority to determine what information must be included in the Call Reports filed by the institutions under their primary supervision. 18. Ensure protection of confidential information received from foreign supervisory authorities Amendment ensures that a federal banking agency may keep confidential information received from a foreign regulatory or supervisory authority if public disclosure of the information would violate the laws of the foreign country, and the banking agency obtained the information in connection with the administration and enforcement of federal banking laws or under a memorandum of understanding between the authority and the agency. The amendment would not authorize an agency to withhold information from Congress or in response to a court order in an action brought by the United States or the agency. 19. Restricting the ability of convicted individuals to participate in the affairs of a bank holding company or Edge Act or agreement corporation Amendment would prohibit a person convicted of a criminal offense involving dishonesty, breach of trust, or money laundering from participating in the affairs of a bank holding company (other than a foreign bank) or an Edge Act or agreement corporation without the consent of the Board. The amendment also would provide the Board with greater discretion to prevent convicted individuals from participating in the affairs of a nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding company. 20. Clarify application of section 8(i) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act Amendment clarifies that a federal banking agency may take enforcement action against a person for conduct that occurred during his or her affiliation with a banking organization even if the person resigns from the organization, regardless of whether the enforcement action is initiated through a notice or an order.
For immediate release The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced its approval of the proposal filed by Wells Fargo & Co., San Francisco, California, to acquire First Community Capital Corporation, Houston, and thereby indirectly acquire First Community Bank, National Association, Houston, and First Community Bank San Antonio, National Association, San Antonio, all in Texas. Attached is the Board's Order relating to this action.
Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan China Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate June 23, 2005 Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to be here today to offer my views on China's trade and exchange rate regime. I would emphasize that the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board. Some observers mistakenly believe that a marked increase in the exchange value of the Chinese renminbi (RMB) relative to the U.S. dollar would significantly increase manufacturing activity and jobs in the United States. I am aware of no credible evidence that supports such a conclusion. The enhanced integration of China into the world trading system is having a notable effect on Asia's trade with the rest of the world and on trade within Asia. After having risen rapidly through the 1990s, U.S. imports from Asia excluding China have flattened since 2000. This has occurred as production within Asia has evolved, with the final stages of assembly and exporting to the United States and elsewhere becoming increasingly concentrated in China. As a consequence, because exports by country are recorded on a gross basis rather than as value added, the widening of the United States' bilateral trade deficit with China, measured gross, has largely been in lieu of wider deficits with other Asian economies, including Japan. Measured by value added, our bilateral deficits with China would have been far less, and our bilateral deficits with other Asian exporters would have been far more. Accordingly, an increase in the exchange rate of the RMB, relative to the dollar, would likely redirect trade within Asia, reversing to some extent the patterns that have emerged during the past half decade. However, a revaluation of the RMB would have limited consequences for overall U.S. imports as well as for U.S. exports that compete with Chinese products in third markets. Such a revaluation would affect Chinese value added but not the dollar cost of intermediate goods imported into China from the rest of Asia, which represents a significant share of the gross value of Chinese exports to the United States and elsewhere. (To the extent that exporters to China revalued as well, of course, the impact on overall Asian exports would be somewhat greater.) The broad tariff on Chinese goods that has recently been proposed, should it be implemented, would significantly lower U.S. imports from China but would comparably raise U.S. imports from other low-cost sources of supply. At only slightly higher prices than prevail at present, U.S. imports of textiles, light manufactures, assembled computers, toys, and similar products would in part shift from China as the final assembler to other emerging-market economies in Asia and, perhaps, in Latin America as well. Few, if any, American jobs would be protected. More generally, any significant elevation of tariffs that substantially reduces our overall imports, by keeping out competitively priced goods, would materially lower our standard of living. A return to protectionism would threaten the continuation of much of the extraordinary growth in living standards worldwide, but especially in the United States, that is due importantly to the post-World War II opening of global markets. Such an initiative would send the adverse message to our trading partners that the United States, while accepting the benefits of broadened world trade, is not willing to absorb the structural adjustments that are often necessary. To maintain a rising standard of living, a dynamic economy such as ours requires a continual shifting of resources toward the most up-to-date technologies, financed not only by savings but also importantly by the depreciation of increasingly obsolescent facilities. This highly dynamic process is mirrored in our labor markets, where jobs are constantly being created and destroyed at a rapid pace. New hires in the United States currently average more than a million per week, half resulting from voluntary job change. At the same time, during a typical recent week, about 150,000 workers are temporarily laid off and another 225,000 are subject to permanent job loss. Any effect of trade with China on U.S. employment is likely to be very small relative to the scale of job creation and job loss in our economy. A policy to dismantle the global trading system in a misguided effort to protect jobs from competition would redound to the eventual detriment of all U.S. job seekers, as well as of millions of American consumers. Policy should aim to bolster the well-being of job losers through retraining and unemployment insurance, not to stave off job loss through counterproductive efforts to impede the process of income-enhancing international trade and globalization. *** While the presumption that a revaluation of the RMB will notably increase jobs in the United States by constraining imports or expanding exports is without statistical or analytical support, it is nonetheless the case that a more flexible RMB would be helpful to China's economic stability and, hence, to world and U.S. economic growth. Rapid accumulation of foreign, largely dollar, reserve holdings by the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, as a consequence of support for the RMB could boost the growth of the money stock, with the accompanying risk of triggering upward pressure on inflation and a general overheating of the Chinese economy. The Chinese central bank's issuance of liquidity management bonds to lessen potential increases in the money supply created by foreign asset accumulation has accelerated since regular issuance began in April 2003. Nonetheless, only about one-half of the increase in reserves over the past two years has been offset, with the remainder showing through as money growth. Because the Chinese financial system has considerable distance to go before achieving a satisfactory degree of soundness and flexibility, sterilization of continuing inflows of speculative funds will presumably become more difficult as the scale of these operations, already large, increases over time. In spite of its recent improvements, the financial system of China is still inordinately governed by administrative command and control. Market pricing of financial instruments is still accorded only a minor role. Financial markets, if left free to continuously reprice interest rates and asset values, will identify and respond to imbalances far sooner than a system based on administrative edict. In market-based financial pricing systems, automatic adjustments are inherent. But in a highly administered system, supervisors can identify emerging imbalances only when these imbalances become visibly large and are already troublesome. Adjustment in a system requiring human intervention is accordingly far less flexible than in a system based on the automaticity of markets. Given this vulnerability to emerging imbalances, the buildup of ever-larger holdings of bonds resulting from sterilization of foreign exchange purchases poses threats to China's financial stability. Hence, the sooner the Chinese, in their own self-interest, move to a more flexible currency regime, perhaps leading other Asian currencies to become more flexible as well, the better for all participants in the global trading system. *** In the decades ahead, it is in our interest and that of the global economy that China continue to progress toward becoming a more market-based, productive, and dynamic economy in which individual initiative, not government decisionmaking, is the fundamental strength behind economic activity. For our part, it is essential that we not put that outcome, or our future, at risk with a step back into protectionism.

Financial Services Policy Committee A Committee of the Conference of Presidents Federal Reserve System David Fettig FSPC Spokesman (612) 204-5274 Federal Reserve Banks Announce Changes to Cash Infrastructure Minneapolis, Minn., June 28, 2005--The Federal Reserve Banks today announced changes to cash services that are intended to improve operating effectiveness by providing cash services at some locations using different distribution methods. The Reserve Banks plan in the next six to twelve months to switch from branch-based cash services to cash depots in Birmingham, Ala.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; and Portland, Ore. These changes are part of a broader effort to update the Federal Reserve's infrastructure for processing currency. "We've looked at, and will continue to look at, major metropolitan markets where we do not have a Federal Reserve presence and at smaller markets where we do have a presence but where different service models might be more effective," said Gary Stern, chairman of the Reserve Banks' Financial Services Policy Committee and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. "We want to ensure that we're making the best use of resources while satisfying the need for cash services. We want to emphasize that the Federal Reserve will continue to make cash services available to depository institutions throughout the country, although in some cases we will do so with a different business model," he said. In 2004 and early 2005, the Federal Reserve discontinued cash services through branches in Little Rock, Ark.; Louisville, Ky.; and Buffalo, N.Y., and established cash depots in those cities. A cash depot is an alternative market presence for Federal Reserve cash services. With a cash depot, the Federal Reserve contracts with a third party-usually an armored carrier - that acts as a secure collection point for Federal Reserve currency deposits from the region's depository institutions. The depot also distributes currency orders that depository institutions have placed with the Reserve Bank. The work of counting deposits and preparing orders is done by a Federal Reserve office in another city. The Federal Reserve pays for the transportation between the Reserve Bank office and the depot operator. The operator follows strict procedures developed by the Federal Reserve. The Birmingham cash depot will be serviced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's head office, the Oklahoma City cash depot will be serviced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas' head office, and the Portland cash depot will be serviced by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco's Seattle office. Approximately 50 cash employees work at the Birmingham, Oklahoma City, and Portland branches combined, but the number that will be affected by these changes is undetermined at this time. The Reserve Banks will offer a variety of programs to staff that are affected by these decisions, including separation packages, extended medical coverage and career transition assistance. The Federal Reserve will continue its evaluation of cash services and plans to announce further changes as recommendations are approved, including the possibility of serving new markets. Cash remains a vital component of the nation's payment system. While studies show that the use of electronic payments is growing, cash use also continues to grow, and the dollar amount of U.S. currency in circulation worldwide has increased almost 88 percent since 1994 to $720 billion at the end of 2004. During the same period, the amount of deposits and orders processed through Reserve Banks has increased nearly 70 percent, to 75 billion banknotes, in 2004. "These changes and others that may come later in the review process will help the Federal Reserve provide cash services more effectively, both when transitioning out of our own cash processing facilities and when establishing a first-time presence in a market," Stern said. # # #

Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision Financial Crimes Enforcement Network For Immediate Release June 30, 2005 Agencies Release Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) today released the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual (FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual). The manual's release marks an important step forward in the effort to ensure the consistent application of the BSA to all banking organizations including commercial banks, savings associations, and credit unions. The FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual was developed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (collectively referred to as the federal banking agencies) in collaboration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the delegated administrator of the BSA. In addition, through the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the state banking agencies played a consultative role. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) collaborated on the development of core overview and examination procedures addressing compliance with regulations enforced by OFAC. The FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual emphasizes a banking organization's responsibility to establish and implement risk-based policies, procedures, and processes to comply with the BSA and safeguard its operations from money laundering and terrorist financing. The BSA/AML examination procedures will guide examiners through an evaluation of a banking organization's BSA/AML compliance program regardless of its size or business lines. The majority of the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual provides narrative guidance and resource materials rather than specific examination procedures. This includes an overview of the BSA requirements and the federal banking agencies' supervisory expectations in this area. The Board, FDIC, OCC, OTS, and FinCEN have planned a series of events to brief the banking industry and field examiners on the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual . These events include nationwide conference calls, regional outreach meetings, and a simulcast via the Internet. Banking organizations are encouraged to participate in these voluntary sessions. (More information on these events is attached in a fact sheet.) Registration details for the industry calls, regional outreach meetings, and the simulcast will be communicated shortly to the banking industry via separate notice.
