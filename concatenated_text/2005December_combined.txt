Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Budget policy To the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Policy Forum, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (videotaped remarks) December 2, 2005 The U.S. economy has delivered a solid performance thus far in 2005. And, despite the disruptions of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, economic activity appears to be expanding at a reasonably good pace as we head into 2006. However, the positive short-term economic outlook is playing out against a backdrop of concern about the prospects for the federal budget over the longer run. To be sure, the current pace of the ramp-up in spending on defense and homeland security is not expected to continue indefinitely. But, as the latest projections from the Administration and the Congressional Budget Office suggest, our budget position will substantially worsen in the coming years unless major deficit-reducing actions are taken. As I recently testified, the necessary choices will be especially difficult to implement without the restoration of procedural restraints on the budget-making process. For about a decade, the rules laid out in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 and in the later modifications and extensions of the act helped the Congress establish a better fiscal balance. However, the brief emergence of surpluses in the late 1990s eroded the will to adhere to these rules of restraint. The rules were aimed specifically at promoting deficit reduction rather than at the broader goal of setting out an agreed-upon standard for determining whether the nation was living within its fiscal means. By the end of the decade, many of the rules that helped constrain budgetary decisionmaking earlier in the 1990s--in particular, the limits on discretionary spending and the PAYGO requirements--were being violated with increasing frequency; finally, in 2002, they were allowed to expire. Reinstating a structure like the one formerly provided by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 would signal a renewed commitment to fiscal restraint and help restore discipline to the annual budgeting process. Such a step would be even more meaningful if it were coupled with the adoption of provisions for dealing with unanticipated budget outcomes. As you are well aware, budget outcomes have often deviated from projections--in some cases, significantly--and they will continue to do so. Accordingly, well-designed mechanisms that facilitate midcourse corrections would ease the task of bringing the budget back into line when it goes awry. In particular, the Congress might want to require that existing programs be assessed regularly to verify that they continue to meet their stated purposes and cost projections. Measures that automatically take effect when a particular spending program or tax provision exceeds a specified threshold may prove useful as well. The original design of the Budget Enforcement Act could also be enhanced by addressing how the strictures might evolve if and when reasonable fiscal balance came into view. I do not mean to suggest that the nation's budget problems will be solved simply by adopting a new set of budgeting rules. The fundamental fiscal issue is the need to make difficult choices among budget priorities, and this need is becoming ever more pressing in light of the unprecedented number of individuals approaching retirement age. For example, future Congresses and Presidents will have to weigh the benefits of continued access, on current terms, to advances in medical technology against other fiscal initiatives. Because the baby boomers have not yet started to retire in force, we have been in a demographic lull. But this period of relative stability will soon end. In 2008--just three years from now--the leading edge of the baby-boom generation will reach 62, the earliest age at which Social Security retirement benefits can be drawn. And in recent years, about half of those eligible to claim benefits at that age have been doing so. Just three years after that, in 2011, the oldest baby boomers will reach 65 and will thus be eligible for Medicare. Currently, 3-1/4 workers contribute to the Social Security system for each beneficiary. Under the intermediate assumptions of the program's trustees, the number of beneficiaries will have roughly doubled by 2030, and the ratio of covered workers to beneficiaries will be down to about 2. The pressures on the budget from this dramatic demographic change will be exacerbated by the anticipated steep upward trend in spending per Medicare beneficiary. The soaring cost of medical care for an aging population is certain to place enormous demands on our nation's resources and to exert pressure on the budget that economic growth alone is unlikely to eliminate. To be sure, favorable productivity developments would help to alleviate the impending budgetary strains. But unless productivity growth far outstrips that embodied in current budget forecasts, it is unlikely to represent more than part of the answer. Higher productivity does, of course, buoy revenues. But because initial Social Security benefits are heavily influenced by economywide wages, faster productivity growth will, with a lag, also raise benefits under current law. Moreover, because the long-range budget assumptions already make a reasonable allowance for future productivity growth, one cannot rule out the chance that productivity growth will fall short of projected future averages. In fiscal year 2005, federal outlays for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid totaled about 8 percent of gross domestic product. The long-run projections from the Office of Management and Budget suggest that the share will rise to 9-1/2 percent by 2015 and to about 13 percent by 2030. So long as health-care costs continue to grow faster than the economy as a whole, they will exert budget pressures that seem increasingly likely to make current fiscal policy unsustainable. The likelihood of growing deficits in the unified budget is of especially great concern because the deficits would drain a correspondingly growing volume of real resources from private capital formation and cast an ever-larger shadow over the growth of living standards. The broad contours of the challenges ahead are clear. But considerable uncertainty remains about the precise dimensions of the problem and about the extent to which future resources will fall short of our current statutory obligations to the coming generations of retirees. We already know a good deal about the size of the adult population in, say, 2030. Almost all who will be in that population have already been born. Thus, forecasting the number of Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries is fairly straightforward. So, too, is projecting future Social Security benefits, which are tied to the wage histories of retirees. However, the uncertainty about future medical spending is daunting. We know very little about how rapidly medical technology will continue to advance and how those innovations will translate into future spending. Consequently, the range of possible outcomes for spending per Medicare beneficiary expands dramatically as we move into the next decade and beyond. Technological innovations can greatly improve the quality of medical care and can, in some instances, reduce the costs of existing treatments. But because technology expands treatment possibilities, it also has the potential to add to overall spending--in some cases, by a great deal. Other sources of uncertainty--for example, the extent to which longer life expectancies among the elderly will affect medical spending--may also turn out to be important. As a result, the range of future possible outlays per recipient is extremely wide. The actuaries' projections of Medicare costs are, perforce, highly provisional. These uncertainties--especially our inability to identify the upper bound of future demands for medical care--suggest significant prudence when considering spending initiatives. New programs, whether spending or tax benefits, quickly develop constituencies who tend to fiercely resist any curtailment. As a consequence, our ability to rein in deficit-expanding initiatives, should they later prove to have been excessive or misguided, is quite limited. Programs can always be expanded in the future should the resources for them become available, but history has shown that they cannot be easily curtailed if resources later fall short of commitments. I fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later. We owe future retirees as much time as possible to adjust their plans for work, saving, and retirement spending. They need to ensure that their personal resources, along with what they expect to receive from the government, will be sufficient to meet their retirement goals. Addressing the government's own imbalances will require scrutiny of both spending and taxes. However, tax increases of sufficient dimension to deal with our looming fiscal problems arguably pose significant risks to economic growth and the revenue base. The exact magnitude of such risks is very difficult to estimate, but, in my judgment, they are sufficiently worrisome to warrant aiming, if at all possible, to close the fiscal gap primarily, if not wholly, from the outlay side. In the end, I suspect that, unless we attain unprecedented increases in productivity, we will have to make significant structural adjustments in the nation's major retirement and health programs. Our current, largely pay-as-you-go social insurance system worked well given the demographics of the second half of the twentieth century. But as I have argued previously, the system is ill-suited to address the unprecedented shift of population from the workforce to retirement that will start in 2008. Much attention has been focused on the forecasted exhaustion of the Social Security trust fund in 2041. But solving that problem will do little in itself to meet the imperative to boost our national saving. Raising national saving is an essential step if we are to build a capital stock that by, say, 2030 will be sufficiently large to produce goods and services adequate to meet the needs of retirees without unduly curbing the standard of living of our working-age population. Unfortunately, the current Social Security system has not proven a reliable vehicle for such saving. Indeed, although the trust funds have been running annual surpluses since the mid-1980s, one can credibly argue that they have served primarily to facilitate larger deficits in the rest of the budget and therefore have added little or nothing to national saving. The challenge of Medicare is far more problematic than that associated with Social Security, mainly because of the large variance of possible outcomes mentioned earlier and the inadequacy of the current medical information base. Some important efforts are under way to use information technology to improve the health-care system. If supported and promoted, these efforts could provide key insights into clinical best practices and substantially reduce administrative costs. And, with time, we should also gain valuable knowledge about the best approaches to restraining the growth of overall health-care spending. Crafting a budget strategy that meets the nation's longer-run needs will become more difficult the more we delay. The one certainty is that the resolution of the nation's unprecedented demographic challenge will require hard choices that will determine the future performance of the economy. No changes will be easy, as they all will involve setting priorities and, in the main, lowering claims on resources. It falls to our elected representatives to determine how best to address the competing claims on our limited resources. In doing so, they will need to consider not only the distributional effects of policy changes but also the broader economic effects on labor supply, retirement behavior, and private saving. In the end, the consequences for the U.S. economy of doing nothing could be severe. But the benefits of taking sound, timely action could extend many decades into the future.
Financial Services Policy Committee Federal Reserve System Pierce Nelson Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (404) 498-8748 Financial Services Policy Committee Announces Atlanta Office Will Retain New Orleans Zone Check Processing Volume Atlanta, Ga., December 5, 2005--The Federal Reserve Banksï¿½ Financial Services Policy Committee (FSPC) today announced that it will retain the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantaï¿½s New Orleans Branch check processing operation at the Atlanta Fedï¿½s head office. Since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in August, the Atlanta office has been processing checks on a contingency basis for the New Orleans zone. The Atlanta Fedï¿½s New Orleans Branch, which will have a staff of just over 100 employees after todayï¿½s announcement, will continue to perform a number of other important functions, including cash services, for the Federal Reserve. All New Orleans check employees, most of whom have been working and living in Atlanta since the disaster struck, will be offered check processing jobs in Atlanta. New Orleansï¿½ check staff members that plan to return to New Orleans will have the opportunity to apply for positions that may be available in functions remaining at the Branch. The FSPC is making this decision in support of the Reserve Banksï¿½ strategy in response to declining check volumes nationally. The date for the final consolidation of New Orleans checks into Atlanta is March 31, 2006. This decision is being announced today, which is outside of the Reserve Banksï¿½ annual check infrastructure review, to assist employees and the Atlanta Fed in moving forward with long-term plans. The Reserve Banks considered moving New Orleansï¿½ check processing to Atlanta this past spring as part of their annual check infrastructure review but decided to delay that move and re-evaluate that decision again in 2006. ï¿½As we looked ahead, we were certain that at some point in the near future we would be moving New Orleansï¿½ check processing volume to Atlanta. Thus, we did not want to ask staff to resettle in New Orleans only to be faced with a move back to Atlanta a short time later,ï¿½ said Patrick K. Barron, first vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and director of the Federal Reserveï¿½s Retail Payments Office. Over the past three years, the Reserve Banks have significantly reduced their total number of check processing locations as check volumes have declined and been replaced by electronic forms of payment, such as credit and debit cards and automated clearinghouse transactions. Today, the Reserve Banks process checks in 27 locations nationwide, down from 45 locations in 2003. An additional six locations, including locations previously announced as well as todayï¿½s announcement, will reduce that number to 21 by the end of 2007. Today, the New Orleans Branch has approximately 155 employees, including 50 check staff members. For Branch employees working at Reserve Bank locations outside of New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has been paying housing and some other living expenses. For check staff choosing to permanently relocate to Atlanta, the Atlanta Fed will pay some moving expenses. For staff not accepting a position in Atlanta or, as available, in New Orleans, the Atlanta Fed will provide various assistance to ease their separation, including severance pay between three months to one year, depending on tenure. The New Orleans Branch will remain open and continue to serve its zone, which covers the southern portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, and much of Floridaï¿½s panhandle. The Branch was closed for operations for one month after Hurricane Katrina before restarting its cash operations near the end of September. Going forward, the New Orleans Branch will continue to provide cash services to financial institutions in its zone and serve as the base of the Sixth Federal Reserve Districtï¿½s cash function office. Importantly, the New Orleans Branch will continue to have a local board of directors that will provide valuable economic intelligence from the Gulf Coast area. In addition, Branch staff will continue to conduct economic and financial education programs for Gulf Coast teachers and students and have a community affairs presence to encourage economic development in low and moderate-income areas. The Atlanta office will continue to fully support financial institutions processing checks in this zone, and institutions using the Reserve Banksï¿½ check services should not notice a significant difference as a result of moving processing from New Orleans to Atlanta. Based on todayï¿½s decision, the Reserve Banks will postpone the previously announced move of the Nashville Branchï¿½s check processing operation into Atlanta until 2007. From an operational perspective, this delay will provide ample time to fully consolidate New Orleans processing and to prepare for the additional volume from Nashville. Nashville was originally targeted to move its volume to Atlanta in early 2006. The Reserve Banksï¿½ long-term strategy to position their check processing infrastructure to match declining paper check volumes has helped the Banks better meet the expectations of the 1980 Monetary Control Act while maintaining high levels of service for financial institutions nationwide. The Monetary Control Act requires the Reserve Banks to set prices to recover, over the long run, their total operating costs of providing payments services to financial institutions, as well as the imputed costs they would have incurred and the profits they would have expected to earn had the services been provided by a private business firm. # # #
Remarks by Governor Mark W. Olson At a Rotary Club luncheon, Sioux Falls, South Dakota December 5, 2005 Economic Growth: Lessons from the Sioux Falls Experience Good afternoon. I am honored to have this opportunity to talk with you and to be with some old friends. In choosing a topic for this afternoon, I decided to begin with an examination of the factors that I think have helped make Sioux Falls a successful and vibrant community. This brief historical review will, I hope, be of interest to you as a retrospective as well as a tribute to your community for the things that it has done so well. I will then discuss the challenges I see for smaller metropolitan areas in the future. Finally, I will highlight the successes that your community has had in creating good jobs and maintaining a healthy economy. I believe that public policy makers--especially those at the national level--can learn much from your experiences. To set the broad demographic background, let's review the recent data on population and job growth in your region. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Census Bureau, both Minnehaha and Lincoln counties have grown rapidly in recent years compared with the rural counties of South Dakota and neighboring states. During the 1990s, the population of Minnehaha County grew about 20 percent, and that of Lincoln County grew more than 55 percent. In contrast, the population of the rural counties in South Dakota and Minnesota increased only about 3 percent, while the population of the rural counties in North Dakota dropped almost 8 percent. This disparity in population growth likely reflects the better job prospects and higher level of community services available in the Sioux Falls metro area and has continued in recent years: Lincoln and Minnehaha counties grew about 9-1/2 percent between 2000 and 2004, while rural counties in South Dakota saw population declines of about 1-1/2 percent. Rates of unemployment roughly parallel these population trends. In particular, the unemployment rates in the metropolitan areas of South Dakota have consistently been lower than in rural areas, and this relative abundance of job opportunities has tended to encourage migration to areas such as Sioux Falls. As of late summer 2005, the rate of unemployment was 3.0 percent in Minnehaha County and 2.4 percent in Lincoln County. In contrast, the rates of unemployment in the rural counties of South Dakota averaged about 5 percent; some of the highest county rates of unemployment reflect persistently high joblessness on Indian reservations. An important cause of the migration from rural areas to metropolitan areas has been the phenomenal growth in farm productivity in recent decades. Those of us with roots in rural America are well aware of the decline in the number of farm families in this country. Although we may lament the steady erosion of small family farms, we must recognize the extraordinary improvements that have been made in the production of agricultural products. According to data from the USDA, two farmers can now produce enough to feed 100 people, a labor requirement that is down by a factor of at least 10 from a few decades ago. In many rural areas, the resulting decline in the number of farmers meant a decline in population. One of the keys to the growth of Sioux Falls has been its ability to attract many of those who left the farm by providing good jobs and an attractive level of services. Indeed, employment growth in your locale compares favorably with comparably sized metropolitan areas in the rest of the country. Since 1990, the rate of job growth in Minnehaha and Lincoln counties has been more than twice that of other U.S. counties that include a metro area of similar size. And compared with similarly sized metropolitan counties in other upper Great Plains states, the rate of growth in jobs in your area since 1990 has been almost 50 percent faster. Economists offer several general hypotheses to explain why some cities prosper. I think that the success of Sioux Falls reflects two in particular. The first is what economists term the concentrated-market theory, which emphasizes the benefits to a business of having consumers that are near at hand. Transportation costs are a key component of this factor. In this context, some of Sioux Falls's economic success reflects its location along natural trade routes. Today, of course, the intersection of Interstate highways 29 and 90 makes Sioux Falls an obvious transportation hub. But even before the city was established, the falls of the Big Sioux River were a landmark that, in the early nineteenth century, provided a gathering place for Native Americans and fur buyers. Near the end of that century, the completion of railroads helped to make Sioux Falls an important trading hub in the region, even as agriculture and resource extraction remained the principal generators of wealth and income. Building upon their early successes in promoting growth, your business forebears here in Sioux Falls were finding innovative ways to create more jobs, even before the great exodus from the farm to the cities after World War I. A good example of this innovation is the John Morrell meat-packing plant that was established here in the early twentieth century. The plant processed and added value to agricultural products and lowered transportation costs by reducing the volume of meat to be shipped. The success of the facility helped to diversify an economy otherwise dominated by agriculture and primary extractive industries. The John Morrell enterprise also helped to create an employment anchor for the local economy, and it continues to provide jobs today. A second economic rationale that is often advanced for the development of cities and that seems applicable to the Sioux Falls experience is that of labor market pooling--the ability of an industry to take advantage of a labor force possessing a specific set of skills, thereby raising productivity compared with competing areas with a more dispersed set of skills. Perhaps the best example of this advantage in Sioux Falls is the extensive health care system, which not only delivers top-quality medical care throughout the region but also supplies a large number of good jobs. However, I submit that there is an additional factor underlying Sioux Falls's success in generating jobs and attracting people. This factor--which sometimes seems to be missing from local, state, and federal legislative and regulatory actions--is the willingness to remove competitive barriers to business at the local and state levels. A good example of this willingness is South Dakota's legislative changes to state usury laws in the early 1980s, which removed regulatory ceilings on rates of interest charged on credit card accounts. These changes helped to encourage Citibank and other credit card subsidiaries to locate their credit card operations in South Dakota, bringing many new jobs in financial industries. In addition, flexible labor laws, as well as South Dakota's reputation as a state with one of the lowest per capita tax rates in the nation (including the absence of corporate income taxes), also make South Dakota attractive to new businesses. These and similar types of policies have helped the local economy grow without the substantial public subsidies that are commonly used elsewhere to woo new businesses. To sum up my brief retrospective, since its founding, Sioux Falls, thanks to its advantageous location and the hard work and visionary leadership of its people, has prospered to a greater degree than the typical smaller metropolitan area in the United States. Sioux Falls has been quite successful in creating a vibrant and growing metropolitan area, but communities such as yours face many challenges in maintaining that vibrancy in an environment of economic change. One of the challenges reflects a new migration pattern that is diminishing some of the flow from rural to metro areas that has benefited Sioux Falls. The 1990s began a rebound in population for many rural areas of the United States. Throughout that decade, more people moved into nonmetro areas than moved out, although the population growth in metro areas still exceeded that in nonmetro areas. This turnaround in population trends was not uniform across all of rural America, as one in four rural counties lost population between 1990 and 2000. During that period, a number of factors became increasingly important in influencing decisions on where to reside. Among these growing influences were amenities such as mild weather and attractive natural resources. Lakes and oceans seem to be especially conducive to attracting population growth. Through its ability to change the competitive landscape, technological innovation is augmenting the nature-related attractiveness of certain rural areas. The Internet and other communications innovations are revolutionizing economies around the world, and many cities may see their competitive advantage erode. Advantages derived from transportation efficiencies seem especially susceptible to this type of erosion, particularly for competition among firms in service-oriented industries. In addition, changes in national policies, such as reduced trade restrictions or modified agricultural programs, can also restructure the competitive landscape dramatically. Finally, exogenous changes in economic conditions can rapidly alter the economic outlook--the recent run-ups in prices for energy and petroleum-intensive products come to mind. To maintain an advantage in the future, business and governmental leaders of Sioux Falls and similar communities must continue to promote economic flexibility and private-sector initiative. Finally, from my current position as a Governor of our nation's central bank, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the role of the Federal Reserve System in economic development. Certainly, a strong and active banking community is a tremendous contributor to an area's development. Experienced loan officers who are well acquainted with their markets can channel funds into the loans that are most likely to create wealth and growth in the local economy. With regard to the Federal Reserve's role in promoting the growth of rural communities, the Fed is charged with maintaining credit conditions that are conducive to our nation's progress. To be sure, our main tool, monetary policy, is a blunt instrument that cannot be targeted at individual industries or regions. However, the Federal Reserve can play a critical role in creating a credit climate that fosters rural progress in general, a climate in which the inherent advantages of individual communities can be realized. We can best promote a progressive credit climate by maintaining an environment of low inflation. An important reason for keeping inflation low is that entrepreneurs must be able to foresee substantial future benefits if they are to be willing to bear the long-term risks that are associated with creating new enterprises, and expected low inflation affords them a clearer view of projected benefits. We also strive to maintain strong banking organizations that can dependably offer the wide range of financial services that a growing community requires. And we promote sound lending practices among banking organizations so that solid enterprises have adequate access to credit and so that the accumulated capital of the community is not dissipated by lending for overly risky schemes. We continually search for ways to make our financial system more competitive and responsive to economic needs. For instance, the Federal Reserve currently has a proposal out for public comment that would reduce regulatory capital requirements for bank holding companies that have consolidated assets of less than $500 million. This proposal would give these smaller bank holding companies more flexibility in determining their desired capital structure, which should improve their competitive position relative to larger bank holding companies. Finally, the Federal Reserve Banks have initiated a variety of programs aimed at studying rural trends and promoting economic development in their regions. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, especially through its Community Affairs Department, has been involved in a number of programs that examine strategies for community development. A major finding of these programs is the deleterious effects of a strategy in which metropolitan areas offer tax subsidies to compete for jobs and economic growth, a strategy that is distinctly different from those approaches that I have advocated today and that have characterized the Sioux Falls experience. In addition, in 1999, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City established the Center for the Study of Rural America, which provides the Federal Reserve System and the nation with timely data and analyses of the progress of rural and smaller metropolitan areas. To conclude, Sioux Falls has been very successful in how it has played the community development game. However, a review of the past reminds us that the economy of any region is subject to change over time and, for a community to remain on top, its business and governmental leaders must continue to push ahead with new ideas for promoting growth in the region. In part, this is true because other, historically less successful communities likely have been borrowing from your playbook, but it is also true because technological innovation likely is changing the rules of the game. Footnotes 1. For convenience, I am designating as rural counties those in the last three categories on a USDA-devised population scale of 1 to 9. Counties in category 9 are the least populated; as of 2003, Minnehaha and Lincoln counties were in category 3.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Acceptance of honorary degree, New York University, New York, New York December 14, 2005 President Sexton, Provost McLaughlin, Chairman Lipton, faculty and students, it is for me a day of nostalgia to be back at New York University, especially having the opportunity to again visit with Bob Kavesh--my classmate of so long ago and partner in founding the classical music society at what is now the Stern School. I am most appreciative of the honorary degree you have chosen to bestow upon me, and especially honored to be sharing the platform this afternoon with my good friend Gordon Brown. The Chancellor, as you heard a short while ago, has achieved an exemplary record as steward of the economy of the United Kingdom and, indeed, is without peer among the worldï¿½s economic policy makers. Gordon, I would like to thank you in particular for your leadership of the Group of Seven this past year. It has been a challenging year, and your voice and vision have been indispensable to the G-7's efforts to maintain global stability and growth in the face of terrorism, further rises in global oil prices, and protectionist pressures. In the more than fifty-seven years since I received my first degree from this university, I have had a front-row seat in observing the exceptional growth in world living standards. With all that exposure, it was inevitable that I would gain some useful insights into the role of open and competitive markets in engendering the wealth of nations. But it is evident, especially in retrospect, that the thorough grounding in fundamentals that I received at this university was an essential preparation. The resilience of open and competitive markets was particularly in evidence in the aftermath of the terrorism of September 2001. Fears were widespread that a contraction of international commerce would halt the widening globalization of most of the previous half-century. And, for a short while, these fears were realized. Global trade faltered. Travel contracted. New projects were postponed. But the freeing of markets over the previous quarter-century had imparted a flexibility that enabled cross-border commerce to quickly stabilize and, by early 2002, to resume its expansion. Despite worrisome pockets of violence and destruction, commerce and wealth-building continues apace. On average, world standards of living are rising, in large part because of the widening embrace of competitive free markets, especially by populous and growing China and India. Since the autumn of 2001, global gross domestic product per capita has grown more than 8 percent. And growth in developing Asia, where so many of the worldï¿½s poor reside, has been considerably faster. Open and free markets are the antithesis of violence. They rest not only on voluntary exchange but also on a necessary condition of voluntary exchange: trust in the word of those with whom we do business. To be sure, all market economies require a rule of law to function--laws of contracts, protection of property rights, and a general protection of citizens from arbitrary actions of the state. Yet, if even a small fraction of legally binding transactions required adjudication, our court systems would be swamped and immobilized. In practice, in virtually all our transactions, whether with customers or with colleagues, we rely on the word of those with whom we do business. If we could not do so, goods and services could not be exchanged efficiently. The trillions of dollars of assets that are priced and traded daily in our financial markets before legal confirmation illustrates the critical role of trust. Even when the law is followed to the letter, appeals to legal authority guide only a few of the day-to-day decisions required of business and financial managers. The rest are governed by whatever personal code of values that market participants bring to the table. Commerce is inhibited if we cannot trust the reliability of counterparties' commitments. Indeed, the willingness to rely on the word of a stranger is integral to any sophisticated economy. This necessary condition for commerce was particularly evident in freewheeling nineteenth-century America, where reputation and trust became valued assets. Throughout much of that century, laissez-faire reigned in the United States as elsewhere, and caveat emptor was the prevailing prescription for guarding against wide-open trading practices. A reputation for honest dealing was thus particularly valued. Even those inclined to be less than scrupulous in their private dealings had to adhere to a more ethical standard in their market transactions, or they risked being driven out of business. To be sure, the history of world business is strewn with Fisks, Goulds, and numerous others treading on, or over, the edge of legality. But they were a distinct minority. If the situation had been otherwise, nineteenth-century market economies would never have achieved so high a standard of living. Over the past half-century, societies have embraced the protections of the myriad initiatives that have partially substituted government financial guarantees and implied certifications of integrity for business reputation. As a consequence, the value of trust so prominent in the nineteenth century seemed by the 1990s to be less necessary. Most analysts believe that the world is better off as a consequence of these governmental protections. But corporate scandals in the United States and elsewhere have clearly shown that the plethora of laws of the past century have not eliminated the less-savory side of human behavior. We should not be surprised, then, to see a reemergence in recent years of the value placed by markets on trust and personal reputation in business practice. After the recent revelations of corporate malfeasance, the market punished the stock prices of those corporations whose behavior had cast doubt on the reliability of their reputations. There may be no better antidote for business and financial transgression. Corporate scandals and evidence of fraud and malfeasance notwithstanding, the history of rising standards of living in a world fearful of violence is extraordinary testimony to the resilience of free peoples engaged in commerce. Our system works fundamentally on trust and individual fair dealing. We need only look around todayï¿½s world to appreciate the value of these traits and the consequences of their absence. While market economies have achieved much in this regard, more remains to be done. Prejudice of whatever stripe is unworthy of a society built on individual merit. A free-market capitalist system cannot operate effectively unless all participants in the economy have the opportunity to achieve their best. If we succeed in opening up opportunities to everyone, the affluence within our borders will almost surely become more equally distributed. Of even greater import, all people will come to recognize that they are part of a system that is fair and worthy of support. * * * Americaï¿½s founding fathers, whose thought had deep roots in the concepts of the British and Scottish enlightenments, bestowed upon us a system of government and a culture of enterprise that have propelled the United States to the greatest material prosperity the world has ever experienced. Todayï¿½s students, both here at NYU and throughout our country, are carrying forward those traditions. I know they will improve upon this inheritance of democratic government and free markets in ways that we have yet to imagine.

Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation National Credit Union Administration Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision For immediate release December 20, 2005 Federal Financial Regulatory Agencies Propose Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Products The federal financial regulatory agencies today issued for comment proposed guidance on residential mortgage products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and sometimes interest. These nontraditional mortgage products include "interest-only" mortgage loans where a borrower pays no principal for the first few years of the loan and "payment option" adjustable-rate mortgages where a borrower has flexible payment options, including the potential for negative amortization. Institutions are also increasingly combining these mortgages with other practices, such as making simultaneous second-lien mortgages and allowing reduced documentation in evaluating the applicant's creditworthiness. While innovations in mortgage lending can benefit some consumers, the agencies are concerned that these practices can present unique risks that institutions must appropriately manage. They are also concerned that these products and practices are being offered to a wider spectrum of borrowers, including subprime borrowers and others who may not otherwise qualify for more traditional mortgage loans or who may not fully understand the associated risks of nontraditional mortgages. The proposed guidance discusses the importance of carefully managing the potential heightened risk levels created by these loans. Toward that end, management should: Assess a borrower's ability to repay the loan, including any balances added through negative amortization, at the fully indexed rate that would apply after the introductory period. The agencies recognize that this requirement differs from underwriting standards at some institutions and are specifically requesting comment on this aspect of the guidance. Recognize that certain nontraditional mortgage loans are untested in a stressed environment and warrant strong risk management standards as well as appropriate capital and loan loss reserves. Ensure that borrowers have sufficient information to clearly understand loan terms and associated risks prior to making a product or payment choice. Comment is requested on all aspects of the guidance, particularly on the section regarding comprehensive debt service qualification standards. Comments are due sixty days after publication in the Federal Register . The guidance is attached.
