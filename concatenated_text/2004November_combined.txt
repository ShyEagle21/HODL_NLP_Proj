Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies At the Securities Industry Association Annual Meeting, Boca Raton, Florida November 5, 2004 Financial Supervision Issues I want to thank you for the invitation to speak at this annual meeting of the Securities Industry Association (SIA). The financial services industry continues to evolve to meet the challenges posed by mergers, new financial instruments, and changing regulatory frameworks. The Federal Reserve Board, as the umbrella supervisor of financial holding companies, has been working with other regulators and financial institutions to improve the effectiveness and relevance of regulation and supervision in this changing environment. Some of the issues that we have been dealing with recently are of mutual concern to both broker-dealers and commercial bankers--albeit they may represent different sides of the coin. Others involve reconciling the differing perspectives and regulatory environments of investment firms and commercial banks around similar financial products and activities in the wake of financial conglomeration. Today I would like to bring you up-to-date on three such issues, as well as highlight some aspects of the Federal Reserve's proposed anti-tying guidelines. In all of these areas, I encourage your participation as we work toward new regulatory guidance. Accounting for Securities The first supervisory issue I would like to discuss involves accounting for investment securities. The recent accounting guidance, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments , or EITF 03-1, has raised serious questions about accounting for investments that are held in available-for-sale portfolios. As many of you are aware, when the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) came to its consensus earlier this year, it was not intending to dramatically change accounting practices for debt securities. But in early August, the public accounting firms began interpreting the guidance very differently. Specifically, if a security was sold from the available-for-sale investment portfolio at a loss, the new interpretation called into question the facts and circumstances that should be used to determine if the remaining portfolio should be viewed as "other than temporarily impaired," and thereby marked down to the lower of cost or market through earnings (LOCOM). At the Federal Reserve, we were concerned about the interpretation since most banks use their available-for-sale portfolio to manage their net interest margin on longer-term, fixed-rate deposits and funding. A LOCOM accounting model applied to such instruments is not consistent with this important management function. For asset-liability management purposes, historical cost accounting better reflects the use of the available-for-sale portfolio to hedge this type of interest rate risk. We have always expected banks to regularly review the fair values of all their securities. But the concept of "tainting" due to realized losses from the available-for-sale portfolio had not been widely applied in such a narrow way. I commend FASB for listening to questions raised by preparers, auditors, and bank regulators and for agreeing to defer the effective date of the impairment guidance in this interpretation. FASB has also issued some implementation guidance, and its comment period ran until October 29. To be sure, the fixed-income research groups of a number of SIA members have played an important role in educating their commercial bank customers on the issues surrounding EITF 03-1 over the past few months. However, more work may be needed and I would encourage you to closely monitor FASB's deliberations. Pay particular attention to the facts and circumstances that should be considered. Note that the guidance allows sales of available-for-sale securities at a loss for the same reasons sales of held-to-maturity securities are permitted without tainting the remaining portfolio. For example, mergers or changes in regulatory capital justify untainted sales. The guidance also permits sales for unexpected and significant changes in liquidity needs or for increases in interest rates. In practice, EITF 03-1 should make all organizations that have available-for-sale securities review their procedures for identifying impairment. Clearly, investors should continue to monitor for credit downgrades and changes in prepayment speeds, especially for interest-only strips and mortgage-backed securities booked at a premium. But the trigger for recognizing impairments for changes in interest rates under EITF 03-1 would no longer be an intent to sell, but rather whether the investor no longer intends to hold the security until fair value recovers to its amortized cost. Also note that the disclosure aspects of EITF 03-1 do apply to third-quarter financial statements. The major change is separate disclosure of securities whose fair value is below carrying cost. Organizations must now disclose separately the amount of securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than one year, and in the narrative discuss why the loss has not yet been recognized. As dealers in investment securities for banks and other investors, your organizations should be aware of the importance of remaining informed about emerging accounting interpretations that deal with long-accepted practices--not only in the context of providing products and services to your customers, but also in your own bank-like entities that may be affected as investors. Regulatory Capital Issues Let me now move on to some accounting issues that relate broadly to the new capital framework for the largest U.S.-based financial institutions, including broker-dealers who wish to have consolidated supervision for purposes of meeting European Union requirements. In general, this entails broker-dealer implementation of Basel II capital requirements. As you know, the Basel II effort to revise bank risk-based capital standards is now in its final stages and moving toward implementation. Importantly, that effort has adopted an approach to credit risk for instruments held in the banking book that differs from the current capital rules applied to instruments held in the trading book under the 1996 Market Risk Amendment (MRA) to the Basel Accord. Clearly, the fair valuing or "marking to market" of commercial bank trading portfolios and the implied short-term holding periods of such positions factor into the different approaches. We must remember, however, that the MRA was adopted at a time when bank trading portfolios looked very different from today. Significant growth in structured transactions, collateralized debt obligations, and credit derivatives are just a few examples of the significant developments over the past several years. Moreover, the MRA was structured with commercial banks in mind and not broker-dealers who, as you know, mark most of their balance sheets to market. Also, both banking organizations and investment firms appear to be holding less-liquid instruments at fair value over longer time horizons than has been traditionally associated with the concept of a commercial bank trading account. Taken together, these industry and regulatory dynamics suggest that the time may have arrived for supervisors to begin to review the appropriateness of the 1996 MRA for commercial bank trading accounts and investment firm fair-valued holdings. In an initial effort to fully identify the types and characteristics of instruments that banks hold in their trading accounts, and that securities firms hold at fair value, a joint subgroup of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is surveying the industry. This survey seeks to gain a better perspective on the range of techniques financial institutions are developing to more robustly measure the risk these instruments entail. The information acquired in the survey is to be fully incorporated in supervisors' review of the current adequacy of the MRA. However, this effort to review the MRA is still in its early stages. As yet, it is uncertain whether the effort will result in minor revisions or significant changes to the current MRA. Challenges in Securities Accounting and Auditing Both of these securities-accounting issues that I have just discussed should also be viewed in light of broader issues that are challenging corporate management, independent accountants, and regulators. Fair value accounting for securities, whether in the income statement or in disclosures, relies on key assumptions, modeling techniques and judgment. For example, modeling techniques are commonly used in valuing mortgage-backed securities. The present value of the estimated future net cash flows attempts to anticipate prepayments of mortgages due to forecasted changes in interest rates. Changes in the assumptions used in the modeling approach for any instrument or product will affect the resulting values. For example, if property values are rising rather than falling, the resulting buildup of home equity can affect a borrower's desire to refinance the loan or use the equity to purchase a more expensive home. Thus, the auditing of model-based fair values for accounting purposes requires a high level of specialized knowledge. The auditor must fully understand how modeling or other sophisticated techniques are used to determine fair value, whether the assumptions used in the models are appropriate, and whether the data have integrity. Furthermore, "fair value" is not always clearly defined or easily determined for some products or instruments. The lack of observable market prices, differences in modeling assumptions, expectations of future events and market conditions, and customer behavior make the task of assigning appropriate valuations very difficult. Certainly, a noncomplex instrument that is highly liquid and that has an observable market price is easier to value with more precision than a highly complex, illiquid instrument. Given the myriad of complex financial instruments that currently exist and that are constantly being created, developing verifiable and auditable fair value estimates is a major concern. And because fair value models are forward looking, an auditor has an additional challenge: determining what is the normal variability in expectations that surrounds any forecast and what is earnings manipulation. To its credit, FASB has recently issued an exposure draft on fair value measurement. The proposal provides a framework for fair value measurement objectives, and it is just the initial phase of a long-term fair value project. The initial phase is generally intended to apply to financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are currently subject to fair value measurement and disclosure. It is not intended to expand the use of fair value measurements in financial statements at the present time. In my view, the proposal is a good first step in enhancing fair value measurement guidance, but I believe additional guidance is warranted. The proposal should address reliability issues more comprehensively. Most important, FASB should develop additional guidance and conduct more research and testing to enhance the reliability of fair value measurements before the use of fair value is significantly expanded in primary financial statements. Furthermore, FASB should work with other organizations including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), and accounting firms to enable the development of robust guidance that ensures fair value estimates can be verified and audited. Anti-Tying Restrictions on Banks Finally, I want to discuss the nature of anti-tying regulations for financial institutions, an issue that can be very confusing to nonbankers. As innovations create new financial instruments, services, and markets, and as banks expand the scope of the financial services they offer, the process banks use to make business decisions is similar to the process many of you apply in your own business. Financial institutions are trying to build customer loyalty by offering a broader menu of financial services to corporate customers. Some of these financial services are more profitable than others, and thus, add greater shareholder value. The concern addressed by anti-tying restrictions is that banks may force customers to take unwanted products in order to obtain needed services--primarily loan products. As a brief background, a special anti-tying statute applies to banks. The statute generally prohibits a bank from conditioning the availability or price of one product on a requirement that a customer also obtain another product that is not a traditional bank product from the bank or an affiliate of the bank. For example, a bank may not inform a customer that it will provide the customer with a loan only if the customer engages the bank's securities affiliate for an underwriting or obtains some other product or service that is not a traditional bank product from the bank or an affiliate. The words "that is not a traditional bank product" are important. Not all tying arrangements are illegal ties. The statute and the Federal Reserve Board's regulations expressly permit a bank to condition the availability or price of a product or service on a requirement that the customer also obtain one or more traditional bank products from the bank or an affiliate. For example, banks for many years required customers obtaining construction financing to maintain compensating balances. A traditional bank product generally is defined as any "loan, discount, deposit, or trust service," and the Board's proposed interpretation provides guidance on what types of products fall within the scope of these terms. In light of the complexities of the anti-tying restrictions, the Board has published and received public comment on both an interpretation of the anti-tying statute and on related supervisory guidance. The proposed interpretation was published to help banking organizations and corporate customers clarify permissible practices under this complex statute in today's financial services environment. Importantly, the interpretation proposes guidelines that a bank should follow when it seeks to engage in traditional "relationship banking," that is, serving its customers on the basis of the profitability of the overall customer relationship with the entire banking organization. The proposed supervisory guidance communicates our expectations as to the types of policies, procedures, internal controls, and training programs that should help banks comply with the anti-tying restrictions. The proposed guidance also emphasizes the importance of the compliance and internal audit functions in ensuring compliance with the law and regulations. Ensuring compliance can be an extremely difficult endeavor because there is no prohibition against cross selling products or aggressive marketing. The goal is to ensure that banks don't cross the line between offering choices and illegally tying products and services. The Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have long required that banking organizations establish and maintain policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the anti-tying restrictions, and the agencies monitor these policies and procedures through the supervisory process. Admittedly, at times it can be difficult to determine whether a violation of the anti-tying statute has occurred. As I mentioned, some forms of tying by banks are expressly permitted, and the statute does not apply to tying arrangements imposed by a bank's nonbank affiliates. Moreover, divining whether a bank imposed a prohibited tie often requires a close review of the facts and circumstances associated with a particular transaction. A prohibited tie, for example, may be conveyed orally and not memorialized in transaction documentation. Our supervisory reviews indicate that banks generally understand and have implemented systems to ensure compliance with the anti-tying provisions to which they are subject. In addition, although we have encouraged customers that believe they have been the subject of an illegal tie to come forward, we have received few complaints from bank customers. Moreover, few customers have sought to challenge their banks directly, although they are granted a private right of action under the statute and may obtain triple damages if successful. A 2003 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on bank tying practices found that the available evidence did not substantiate claims that banks were engaging in illegal tying, but the report did note that borrowers were reluctant to file formal complaints. The GAO recommended that the Board consider taking additional steps to enforce compliance with the anti-tying provisions. Our proposed interpretation and guidance are intended to help banks and the customers understand this rather complex compliance area. I should mention that we also received a comment letter on the proposed interpretation from the Department of Justice. This letter, which is available on the Department's web site, expresses concern that the bank anti-tying statute itself may suppress competition and harm consumers, especially as it is applied to large customers. The Justice Department recommends that the Board interpret the bank anti-tying statute in a manner similar to the federal antitrust laws. Under federal antitrust laws, which apply to independent broker-dealers, a showing of market power is essential to support a finding that a company has coerced its customer to purchase an unwanted product or service. In contrast, the courts historically have found that the special anti-tying statute that applies only to banks generally does not require a showing of market power to support a violation. Alternatively, the department recommends that the Board exercise its statutory authority to exempt large, corporate customers from the reach of the bank anti-tying statute. These are all issues the Board will have to carefully consider as it moves toward finalizing the anti-tying interpretation and guidance. Conclusion I know that the SIA and your financial firms have been devoting time to many of the regulatory issues that have made the headlines in the past several years. I hope that my comments today will also remind you that the evolution of the industry and financial products creates challenges that you are likely to encounter in the more normal course of business.

Remarks by Governor Mark W. Olson At the Fraser Institute Roundtable Luncheon, Toronto, Canada November 15, 2004 Recent Economic Experience and Outlook Thank you for inviting me to speak to you today about my assessment of current economic conditions in the United States and what is required to maintain an economic environment conducive to growth, job creation, and price stability. I should note that my remarks today reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or in the Federal Reserve System. Commentaries on the economy often focus too heavily on the latest weekly and daily data. To put today's economic performance in a broader context, I would like to step back briefly and touch on some recent economic history. As you know, the latter half of the 1990s was a time of remarkable economic performance, fueled importantly by an investment boom that contributed to rapid growth in labor productivity. However, by late 2000, that boom had come to an end, and businesses abruptly curtailed capital spending--particularly for high-tech equipment. The cutback in spending occurred as expectations about the potential profitability of new investment opportunities turned down, and many companies, such as those in the telecommunications sector, found that they had invested too much in equipment and office space during the boom. With the sudden drop-off in business demand, inventories began to pile up, and producers cut production of all types of goods in early 2001. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve reduced the target rate for the federal funds rate sharply over the course of 2001 to contain the weakness and head off a more serious deterioration following the terrorist attacks in September. This monetary policy stance, coupled with stimulative fiscal policy, was generally successful. In contrast to most U.S. recessions since World War II, consumer spending and residential investment were both relatively well maintained during this period. Even as firms cut employment and stock market losses eroded household wealth throughout 2001 and 2002, household spending was supported by tax cuts, low inflation, and low interest rates. Consumers took advantage of falling mortgage rates to buy new homes, to refinance their existing mortgage debt, and to tap into their increasing home equity to pay off more expensive debt or to finance spending on other things. As a result, the recession in 2001 turned out to be quite shallow, and activity in 2002 recovered modestly even though businesses continued to cut spending on capital and reduce employment throughout 2002. Despite the reduction in business investment, significant improvements in efficiency allowed firms to meet their sales and production goals without having to add workers. These improvements seem to have been the result both of organizational changes in business operations and of innovations in the use of existing technologies, perhaps the result of firms applying more effectively the new technologies they had acquired at a rapid pace in the late 1990s. In 2003, the recovery took hold: The pace of consumer expenditures stepped up, and housing activity boomed. These developments were supported by a pickup in personal income growth as job losses abated and hourly compensation moved up, as well as by rising stock market and housing wealth. In addition, the caution and uncertainty that had weighed on businesses began to dissipate, and investment turned up in the spring. A marked increase in capital spending in the second half of last year was spurred by significantly improving profits, low interest rates, and investment tax incentives. Nonetheless, the recovery remained "jobless" until the fall, when growth in private employment began to resume. Output in the first quarter of this year continued to expand at the robust pace of 2003, and employment gains picked up sharply. However, economic activity hit a soft patch in the late spring: The growth of real gross domestic product slowed to an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent in the second quarter after posting a 4-1/2 percent average pace in the first quarter of this year and over the four quarters of 2003. The second-quarter slowing was particularly evident in consumption, which was nearly unchanged on average between April and June. Furthermore, job gains in the private sector, which had averaged close to 300,000 per month between March and May of this year, slowed to about 100,000 per month on average during the summer. Economic developments this year have undoubtedly been influenced by the steep run-up in oil prices from about $30 per barrel for West Texas intermediate crude oil in December 2003 to a record level of $55 per barrel this past October. This rise in energy prices clearly has had a negative effect on the real purchasing power of households and has raised business costs. Nevertheless, the United States is probably less vulnerable to this year's oil price shock than it was to the shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s, both because energy represents a smaller share of household purchases and business input costs than in those earlier periods and because the higher oil prices reflect, in part, stronger growth in the rest of the world, which in turn provides an offset in the form of higher demand for U.S. exports. Indeed, the most recent data suggest that the U.S. economy has regained some vigor in the second half of this year. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP expanded at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the third quarter, and final sales grew at the fastest pace in a year. In particular, real consumer spending rebounded, as households responded to the aggressive incentives offered by motor vehicle companies by sharply increasing their purchases of new cars and trucks. In addition, low mortgage rates have helped sustain a high level of demand for new homes, and business investment in equipment and software posted another robust gain, led by a sharp increase in spending on non-high-tech equipment. Available indicators for the fourth quarter seem a little more mixed, but the general consensus of economic forecasters is that real GDP will expand in the fourth quarter at a pace similar to that in the third quarter. Although real incomes continue to be squeezed by significantly higher energy prices, recent spending indicators, including last Friday's retail sales report, suggest that consumption was well maintained in October. In addition, housing construction and home sales have been maintained at a robust pace in recent months, and recent declines in mortgage rates should continue to support demand. Business demand for high-tech equipment seems to have softened a little in recent months, judging both from the data on new orders and from industry commentary. However, business investment on non-high-tech equipment should be buoyed by strong fundamentals, including low interest rates and strong corporate balance sheets, as well as by the partial-expensing provisions of the current tax code, which encourage businesses to accelerate investment spending on longer-lived equipment to take advantage of the temporary tax incentive before it expires at the end of the year. Presumably reflecting these factors, bookings for non-high-tech capital goods have been on a steep uptrend in recent months. The latest reading on the labor market, which has been a source of uncertainty for some time, was particularly encouraging. After slowing this summer, employment on private nonfarm payrolls rose nearly 300,000 in October, about the same as the robust pace reported during the spring of this year. October's increase was boosted somewhat by a sizable increase in construction employment, which was partly related to rebuilding and cleanup activity following this summer's hurricanes. But even so, the pace of hiring picked up for a wide range of other industries as well. That said, recent surveys and the continued, low level of labor force participation suggest that households remain concerned about a lack of employment opportunities, and we will have to wait and see whether this faster pace of hiring can be sustained. As you know, Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, and hence trade provides an important link between our economies. Indeed, U.S. exports to Canada are rising briskly so far this year, albeit still not quite as fast as the rise in U.S. imports from Canada. More generally, a surge in Canadian exports has helped fuel the recovery in Canada this year despite an appreciation of the Canadian dollar. However, unlike the United States, Canada is a net exporter of oil and other commodities and thus has also benefited, on balance, from the sustained rise in oil and other commodity prices this year. Recent Canadian data are consistent with robust domestic demand growth in the third quarter, and employment gains have recently been strong. Over time, future improvements along these lines may also support higher demand for imports, which will in part come from the United States. Turning to the outlook for U.S. inflation, the rise in crude oil prices--coupled with rising margins for gasoline and higher prices for natural gas--contributed to a 25 percent annual rate of increase in consumer energy prices over the first half of the year. And, although energy prices turned down briefly during the summer as gasoline margins returned to more normal levels, the latest indicators are pointing to significant increases in energy prices again this quarter. As a result, headline consumer price inflation--as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index--rose at an annual rate of around 2-1/2 percent over the first three quarters of this year, up from 1-3/4 percent in each of the past three years. Despite the rise in oil prices, core consumer prices have risen at a moderate pace in recent months after picking up early this year from last year's very low rate. On average, core PCE prices have increased at a 1-1/2 percent annual rate over the first three quarters of this year, up only slightly from a 1-1/4 percent increase over the four quarters of 2003. As with the real economy, the absence of a more significant effect from oil prices on core inflation reflects, in part, the smaller share of energy in firms' production processes. But in addition, the Federal Reserve's commitment to low inflation seems to have limited the pass-through of higher energy prices to wages and inflation expectations. Indeed, despite some rapid increases in benefit costs--most notably for health insurance and defined benefit pension plans--overall hourly compensation has been rising at roughly a 4 percent annual rate this year, similar to last year's pace. Similarly, surveys of inflation expectations and implied inflation compensation from Treasury indexed security yields suggest that longer-term inflation expectations have been well anchored over this period, and short-term inflation expectations have actually eased on balance since midyear despite the rise in energy prices. Looking ahead, economic fundamentals are consistent with the U.S. economy posting solid growth over the next year. Indeed, most forecasters expect that output will continue to rise next year at a pace similar to this year's. For example, the most recent Blue Chip forecast sees output rising at a 3-1/2 percent rate in 2005, just a touch slower than their forecast for growth over the four quarters of this year. With regard to inflation, the Blue Chip participants see the rise in the consumer price index slowing from 3.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent over the four quarters of 2005. There are a number of reasons for this reasonably favorable outlook. First, monetary policy remains accommodative, even with the rise of 100 basis points in the federal funds rate since late June. The nominal federal funds rate is currently 2 percent, a level that, using standard measures of core consumer price inflation, implies a real funds rate that is just above zero--considerably lower than the long-run average of about 2-3/4 percent. Of course, this long-run average may differ from the level of the real federal funds rate that is currently consistent with moving economic activity into line with its potential and keeping inflation low and stable. But even taking into account possible factors that would tend to push down the equilibrium rate--for example, business pessimism, energy prices, and our net export position--the real funds rate still seems low. Second, financial conditions in general look to be supportive of continued solid economic expansion. In addition to benchmark real interest rates being low, risk spreads are quite narrow, and lenders appear very willing to provide credit to businesses and households. Moreover, many businesses, through their actions to repair their balance sheets in recent years, have built up large holdings of cash that can be tapped to finance investment outlays, and the substitution of long-term debt for short-term debt has reduced the exposure of many firms to rising interest rates. Third, robust growth in underlying productivity should continue to support income growth and economic activity. I suspect that productivity will eventually slow from the extraordinary pace of the past few years--indeed, the recent figures offer some evidence that some of the slowing has already occurred. Nonetheless, I am optimistic that part of the step-up in productivity will be sustained and that it will be reinforced by a robust pace of capital spending. Continued solid gains in productivity will be an important plus for our economy over the longer run because faster increases in productivity lead over time to higher profits, wages, and living standards. On the inflation front, the best news is that inflation is expected to be relatively low. With inflation expectations well anchored, the existing amount of slack and underlying strength in productivity should be offsetting pressures from indirect energy effects and other commodity price increases, which themselves should diminish as oil prices stabilize and then begin to decline. Nevertheless, and as always seems to be the case, there are considerable uncertainties surrounding the outlook for real activity and inflation. An obvious source of risk for the U.S. expansion continues to be the behavior of energy prices. As I noted, the steep run-up in crude oil prices this year has significantly restrained real activity and pushed up overall inflation. And, the outlook for oil prices remains uncertain. Higher oil prices have damped the consumption of oil in the United States, but growing concerns about long-term supply, along with large prospective increases in demand from the rapidly growing economies of China, India, and other emerging-market economies have fueled an increase in futures prices of oil. In recent weeks, spot prices have eased back from mid-October's record levels, and market participants in oil futures markets seem to expect spot prices to ease somewhat further over the next two years. But both the global demand for oil and the availability of new supplies are notoriously difficult to predict. Another uncertainty revolves around the effect of current tax policy on economic activity. Fiscal policy, which has been stimulative this year, is expected to shift to a fairly neutral stance in 2005, following the removal of the partial-expensing provision for various capital goods at the end of this year. Because the partial-expensing provision allows firms to subtract a large share of the cost of new capital equipment from profits right away, rather than depreciating the cost over time, it provides an incentive to firms to invest in new capital goods. However, estimates of the quantitative effect of this tax incentive on investment are highly uncertain. And anecdotal evidence that firms are responding to the partial-expensing provision is not clear-cut. As a result, the impact of its removal is equally unclear. Specifically, if partial expensing is having a very limited effect on firms' investment decisions, recent increases in business spending on equipment would be consistent with a stronger underlying pace of investment and faster GDP growth next year. Finally, the sustainability of expansion will depend importantly on the pace of improvement in the labor market. To be sure, October's payroll employment report was a positive sign. But as we saw earlier this year, one month of data does not make a trend. Robust job gains in the coming quarters would be a convincing sign that businesses have become more confident about the future course of the expansion and would provide households with the wherewithal to maintain a healthy pace of spending growth. Let me turn finally to a brief discussion of monetary policy. As I noted earlier, monetary policy has played an important role in providing support for the economy in recent years. But our work is not done. Now that the expansion seems to have taken hold, we face the challenge of making the transition to a policy stance more appropriate for sustained economic expansion. Our goal is to do so in a way that maximizes economic growth while sustaining the progress that we have made in achieving price stability. Keeping inflation low and stable will contribute importantly to sustaining financial conditions conducive for further gains in economic activity. Along these lines, the FOMC has raised the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of our last four meetings. As indicated in its most recent statement, the FOMC continues to support the assessment that removal of accommodation will likely proceed at a measured pace. However, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability, and it is those developments that will ultimately determine the level and term structure of interest rates.

Remarks by Governor Susan Schmidt Bies To the International Association of Credit Portfolio Managers General Meeting, New York, New York November 18, 2004 Fair Value Accounting Good morning. I appreciate the opportunity to participate in your Fall General Meeting. As my colleagues at the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) will agree, fair value accounting poses many challenges and has sparked significant industry debate. As you may be aware, the subject of fair value accounting has been discussed in the United States for well over a decade. Advocates of fair value accounting believe that fair value is the most relevant measure for financial reporting. Others, however, believe that historical cost provides a more useful measure because it more clearly represents the economics of business performance and because fair value estimates may not be reliable or verifiable. So, which is more appropriate--fair value or historical cost? Let me share with you the Federal Reserve's long-standing position on this issue. As a supervisor of the U.S. banking system, we want to ensure that financial institutions follow sound accounting policies and practices. We continue to support improved transparency and enhanced financial disclosures, which promote market discipline and provide useful information to decisionmakers. We also support fair value accounting for assets and liabilities used in the business of short-term trading for profit, such as the trading account for banks. And we support enhanced disclosures of fair-value-based information as part of broader descriptions of risk exposures and risk management. However, we believe that the accounting industry should be very careful before moving toward a more comprehensive fair value approach, where all financial assets and liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings, whether realized or not. As many of you know, FASB recently issued a proposed standard on fair value measurements that provides a general framework for valuing assets and liabilities that are currently measured or disclosed at fair value. At this time, it does not expand the use of fair values in the primary financial statements. Although my colleague here from FASB is much better suited than I to address the details of the proposal, I would like to summarize and share with you the Federal Reserve's views on the proposed standard, which were provided to FASB in a comment letter as part of the exposure process. We see the proposal as a good first step toward enhancing measurement guidance in this area. However, as I will discuss in a moment, a number of important issues warrant further consideration, especially before dramatic moves are made toward increased fair value accounting. But before discussing these specific issues, allow me to emphasize one important point. As a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve believes that innovations in risk management are very important to the continued improvement of our financial system. New methods and financial instruments allow banking organizations to improve their risk-management practices by selecting target levels of risk exposures and shedding or limiting unwanted positions. Whenever possible, the accounting framework should avoid providing a disincentive to better management of risk. Fair Value Measurement Issues That Warrant Further Consideration Reliability and Measurement If markets were liquid and transparent for all assets and liabilities, fair value accounting clearly would be reliable information useful in the decisionmaking process. However, because many assets and liabilities do not have an active market, the inputs and methods for estimating their fair value are more subjective and, therefore, the valuations less reliable. Research by Federal Reserve staff shows that fair value estimates for bank loans can vary greatly, depending on the valuation inputs and methodology used. For example, observed market rates for corporate bonds and syndicated loans within lower-rated categories have varied by as much as 200 to 500 basis points. Such wide ranges occur even in the case of senior bonds and loans when obligors are matched. The FASB statement on the proposed fair value standard suggests that reliability can be significantly enhanced if market inputs are used in valuation. However, because management uses significant judgment in selecting market inputs when market prices are not available, reliability will continue to be an issue. The proposal identifies three levels of estimates, with the lowest priority given to level-3 estimates. These estimates are not based on quoted prices in active markets for either identical or similar assets or liabilities, but rather on mark-to-model estimates. The proposal suggests that the use of multiple approaches, such as the market, income, and replacement-cost methods, will improve reliability of these estimates. However, the number of approaches adds little to reliability if all the methods are based on the same underlying information, as would often be the case for financial instruments. In our role as a bank supervisor, we have observed that minor changes in a number of assumptions in a pricing model can have a substantial effect. Generally, we are comfortable with the fair value measurement process for liquid trading instruments that financial institutions have had significant experience in valuing. However, we believe that for less-liquid assets and liabilities, reliability is a significant concern. Management Bias The fact that management uses significant judgment in the valuation process, particularly for level-3 estimates, adds to our concerns about reliability. Management bias, whether intentional or unintentional, may result in inappropriate fair value measurements and misstatements of earnings and equity capital. This was the case in the overvaluation of certain residual tranches in securitizations in recent years, when there was no active market for these assets. Significant write-downs of overstated asset valuations have resulted in the failure of a number of finance companies and depository institutions. Similar problems have occurred due to overvaluations in nonbank trading portfolios that resulted in overstatements of income and equity. As you are aware, the possibility for management bias exists today. We continue to see news stories about charges of earnings manipulation, even under the historical cost accounting framework. We believe that, without reliable fair value estimates, the potential for misstatements in financial statements prepared using fair value measurements will be even greater. Verification As the variety and complexity of financial instruments increases, so does the need for independent verification of fair value estimates. However, verification of valuations that are not based on observable market prices is very challenging. As I mentioned, many of the values will be based on inputs and methods selected by management. Estimates based on these judgments will likely be difficult to verify. Both auditors and users of financial statements, including credit portfolio managers, will need to place greater emphasis on understanding how assets and liabilities are measured and how reliable these valuations are when making decisions based on them. "Compound" Values and Revenue Recognition The value of a financial instrument may, in some cases, be coupled with an intangible value. For example, a servicing asset can be considered to reflect two values: a financial instrument that is similar to an interest-only strip and an intangible value reflecting the contractual right to perform services over time in exchange for a fee. The current accounting framework often requires different accounting and disclosure treatments for financial and nonfinancial components. However, the accounting literature offers little guidance on when these assets should be separated and how to determine the separate valuations. This lack of guidance may in some cases result in questionable or inappropriate practices, such as including projected income from cross-marketing activities in the valuation of financial instruments. Additional guidance to address these issues is warranted. Also, consideration must be given to revenue-recognition issues in a fair value regime. We must ensure that unearned revenue is not recognized up front, as it inappropriately was by certain high-tech companies not so long ago. Disclosures Fair values reflect point estimates and by themselves do not result in transparent financial statements. Additional disclosures are necessary to bring meaning to these fair value estimates. FASB's proposal takes a first step toward enhancing fair value disclosures related to the reliability of fair value estimates. I believe that additional types of disclosures should be considered to give users of financial statements a better understanding of the relative reliability of fair value estimates. These disclosures might include key drivers affecting valuations, fair-value-range estimates, and confidence levels. Another important disclosure consideration relates to changes in fair value amounts. For example, changes in fair values on securities can arise from movements in interest rates, foreign-currency rates, and credit quality, as well as purchases and sales from the portfolio. For users to understand fair value estimates, I believe that they must be given adequate disclosures about what factors caused the changes in fair value. Considerations for Credit Portfolio Management Fair value estimates affect the information you use as credit portfolio managers. Today's financial statements are based on a mixed-attribute accounting model. This means that an entity's balance sheet may include certain values reported at historical cost and certain values reported at fair value. You probably learned more about this in yesterday's break-out session about managing profit and loss volatility. Fair values may be used as an analytic tool in the lending process and are compared with historical cost values. This historical cost information, along with associated disclosures, contains reliable information that provides insights into a firm's expected cash flows. As the industry moves toward expanded use of fair value, I believe disclosure of certain historical cost information will remain essential. As I mentioned earlier, the reliability of the valuations and the transparency of the methods and inputs used to calculate the values are critically important. Clearly, fair valuations will have an impact on leverage ratios, capital ratios, and other ratios used in the lending and credit-management process. Credit portfolio managers will need to identify and understand the impact of changes in fair value estimates that result from changes in specific factors, economic conditions, management judgment, modeling techniques, and so forth. Accounting Treatment for Credit Derivatives Many of you may have seen earnings volatility resulting from the use of credit derivatives. I understand that credit derivatives were discussed in yesterday's session, so you probably have already heard some perspectives on this topic. Under U. S. generally accepted accounting principles, credit derivatives are generally required to be recognized as an asset or liability and measured at fair value, and the gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value must be recorded in earnings. Most credit derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, which would permit the gain or loss on the credit derivative to be reported in the same period as the gain or loss on the position being hedged, assuming the hedge is effective. Therefore, the use of credit derivatives can result in earnings volatility. Consider a credit derivative that hedges credit risk of a loan, for example. As the loan's credit quality deteriorates, the value of the credit derivative improves. Since the loan is recorded at historical cost, and the credit derivative is marked to fair value, a gain from the change in value of the derivative is recognized in earnings. Conversely, if the loan's credit quality improves, the value of the credit derivative declines, resulting in a reported loss. These gains and losses may be offset by the level of provisions that are established for estimated credit losses on the loan, but this would likely result in only a partial offset. As management attempts to reduce this earnings volatility, we may see changes in risk-management practices. Unfortunately, some managers might use fewer credit derivatives to reduce credit risk due to this potential earnings volatility. Accordingly, setters of accounting standards need to consider improvements to the accounting treatment that do not result in a disincentive to those who prudently use credit derivatives for risk-management purposes. You may be wondering if the answer to this volatility issue is fair value accounting. If the hedged asset were measured at fair value, the changes in values of the hedged item and the credit derivative may offset each other, reducing the volatility that arises when only the derivative is marked to market and not the hedged item. Of course, the degree of the earnings volatility under a full fair value accounting approach would depend on the effectiveness of the hedge. The IASB developed the new "fair value option" under International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39. Using this option, companies that use international accounting standards will be permitted to apply fair value accounting to certain financial instruments that they designate at the time of purchase or origination. Accordingly, firms using the fair value option could mark to market both the credit derivative and the hedged position and report changes in their fair values in current earnings. While at first glance the fair value option might be viewed as "the solution" to addressing the problems of the mixed-attribute model, it also raises a number of concerns. Many of these concerns, as well as recommendations to address them, were included in a comment letter to the IASB from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) issued on July 30. Let me first summarize some of the Basel Committee's concerns, many of which are similar to those I described earlier. Addressing reliability and verifiability issues, the committee suggested that, without observable market prices and sound valuation approaches, fair value measurements are difficult to determine, verify, and audit. It also suggested that reporting will become more complex and less comparable. The Basel Committee comment letter also discussed the "own credit risk" issue. If an entity's creditworthiness deteriorates, financial liabilities would be marked down to fair value and a gain would be recorded in the entity's profit and loss statement. In the most dramatic case, an insolvent entity might appear solvent as a result of marking to market its own deteriorated credit risk. To address these concerns, the Basel Committee recommended certain restrictions on the fair value option, such as disallowing the marking to market of credit risk of the institution's own outstanding debt and prohibiting the fair value option for illiquid financial instruments. It also suggested that the fair value option be limited to transactions that seek to economically hedge risk exposures and to situations in which accounting volatility associated with the mixed-attribute model can be reduced. Lastly, it recommended enhanced disclosures related to the fair value option. Representatives of the Basel Committee continue to work constructively with the IASB on these issues, and I believe this dialogue can lead to a more-balanced approach to the fair value option that supports transparent accounting and sound risk-management policies in a manner consistent with safe and sound banking practices. As banking organizations using IASB standards consider how to use the fair value option for their own financial reporting purposes, additional issues should be considered. For example, if loans are accounted for under the fair value option, what impact would that have on loan loss allowances, which under risk-based capital standards are a component of regulatory capital? Would changes in loan-loss provisioning practices due to the fair value option reduce regulatory capital, and, if so, how would this capital be replaced? How would the fair value option affect important asset-quality measures, such as nonperforming assets? From an earnings perspective, how would net interest margin be affected? As you can see, a number of important practical issues need to be addressed. Conclusion FASB's fair value measurement standard is a good first step toward developing enhanced guidance for the estimation of fair values. However, much more work needs to be done before fair value estimates are reliable, verifiable, and auditable. As credit portfolio managers, you need to be aware of these movements to fair value accounting and how they will affect your understanding of companies you evaluate. Credit derivatives can be a useful tool in managing credit risk. However, they raise thorny accounting issues. While IASB's fair value option is one possible approach to addressing these problems, further development of this alternative accounting method should move forward in a balanced fashion to ensure that it results in an actual improvement in accounting practices.
