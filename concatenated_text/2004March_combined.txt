Joint Press Release Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation For Immediate Release March 11, 2004 Interagency Guidance Issued on Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices by State-Chartered Banks The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation today issued guidance outlining standards they will apply to determine when acts or practices by state-chartered banks are unfair or deceptive. Such practices are illegal under section five of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act. In order to respond to questions raised by institutions under the agencies' supervision, the statement also provides guidance on steps that state-chartered banks can take to avoid engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The approach outlined in the statement is based on long-established standards used by the FTC to enforce section five of the FTC Act against non-bank entities. In 2002, the Board and the FDIC affirmed their authority to apply the prohibition against unfair or deceptive acts or practices to the activities of state-chartered banks. At that time, the agencies also announced their intention to issue further guidance for state-chartered banks with respect to the prohibition.

Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan Education Before the Committee on Education and the Workforce, U.S. House of Representatives March 11, 2004 The United States economy has long been characterized by a strong tradition of entrepreneurial spirit among our business people, a high level of skill among our workers, and an openness by firms and workers alike to intense competition within and beyond our borders. Those attributes have given us a standard of living unparalleled for so large a population--and one that has risen steadily over the history of our nation. But with that bounty have also come the inevitable stresses and anxieties that accompany economic advance. One concern that has persisted for some time is the fear that we are irreversibly losing manufacturing jobs because of businesses' efforts to extract rapid gains in production efficiencies and to cut labor costs by tapping the lower-wage economies of Asia and Latin America. More recently, similar concerns have arisen about the possibility that an increasing number of our better-paying white-collar jobs will be lost to outsourcing, especially to India and China. Many of these jobs are in the service sector, and they were previously perceived as secure and largely free from the international competition long faced in the manufacturing sector. There is a palpable unease that businesses and jobs are being drained from the United States, with potentially adverse long-run implications for employment and the standard of living of the average American. Job insecurity is understandably significant when nearly two million members of our workforce have been unemployed for more than six months. The issue is both important and sensitive, dealing as it does with the longer-term wealth of our nation and with the immediate welfare of so many individuals and communities. In the debate that has ensued, a large gulf is often perceived between the arguments of economists, who almost always point to the considerable benefits offered over the long term by exposure to free and open trade, and the obvious stress felt by those caught on the downside of turbulence created by that exposure. It is crucial that this gulf be bridged. As history clearly shows, our economy is best served by full and vigorous engagement in the global economy. Consequently, we need to increase our efforts to ensure that as many of our citizens as possible have the opportunity to capture the benefits that flow from that engagement. For reasons that I shall elucidate shortly, one critical element in creating that opportunity is the provision of rigorous education and ongoing training to all members of our society. This proposal is not novel; it is, in fact, the strategy that we have followed successfully for most of the past century and a strategy that we now should embrace with renewed commitment. Over the long sweep of American generations and waves of economic change, we simply have not experienced a net drain of jobs to advancing technology or to other nations. Since the end of World War II, for example, the unemployment rate in the United States has averaged less than 6 percent with no apparent trend; and as recently as 2000, it dipped below 4 percent. Moreover, real earnings of the average worker have continued to rise. Over the past century, per capita real income has risen at an average rate of more than 2 percent per year, declining notably only during the Great Depression of the 1930s and immediately following World War II. Incomes trended higher whether we had a trade deficit or a trade surplus and whether international outsourcing was large or small. More fundamental economic forces have apparently been at work. Research on wealth creation in both emerging and developed nations strongly suggests that it is the knowledge and the skill of our population interacting under our rule of law that determine our real incomes, irrespective of the specific jobs in which these incomes are earned and irrespective of the proportion of domestic consumption met by imports. These upward trends in the standard of living, however, mask the stress that significant parts of our workforce endure. Joseph Schumpeter, the renowned Harvard professor, called the process of progress "creative destruction," the continuous scrapping of old technologies to make way for the new. Standards of living rise because the cash flows of industries employing older, increasingly obsolescent, technologies are marshaled, along with new savings, to finance the production of capital assets that almost always embody cutting-edge technologies. Workers migrate with the capital. This is the process by which wealth is created, incremental step by incremental step. The process of creative destruction has been accompanied by an ever-growing conceptualization of economic output. Ideas rather than materials or physical brawn have been by far the greatest contributors during the past half-century to our average annual increase of 3-1/4 percent in real gross domestic product. Technological advance is continually altering the shape, nature, and complexity of our economic processes. To effectively manage this ever-increasing complexity, our labor force has had to become more and more technically oriented. Years of schooling, a rough proxy for skills, averaged nine and one-quarter years in 1950. A half-century later, schooling averaged more than twelve years. At the risk of some oversimplification, if the skill composition of our workforce meshed fully with the needs of our increasingly complex capital stock, wage-skill differentials would be stable, and percentage changes in wage rates would be the same for all job grades. This was largely the case through the 1960s when the addition of skilled college graduates to the labor force, in part the result of schooling financed by the GI Bill, was sufficient to hold wage increases among the highly skilled to average gains. Real wages of the lesser skilled also rose significantly, in part as a result of effective high-school educations and the many skills learned during the war. In the 1970s, the supply of skilled workers received another boost from the rapid expansion of our nation's community colleges. In short, technical proficiencies across all job grade levels appeared to rise about in line with the needs of our, even then, complex stock of capital. But for the past twenty years the real incomes of skilled, especially highly skilled, workers have risen more than the average of all workers, whereas real wage rate increases for lesser-skilled workers have been below average, indeed virtually nonexistent. This difference in wage trends suggests that, at least in relative terms, we have developed a shortage of highly skilled workers and a surplus of lesser-skilled workers. Although in recent years the proportion of our labor force made up of those with at least some college education has continued to grow, we appear, nonetheless, to be graduating too few skilled workers to address the apparent imbalance between the supply of such workers and the burgeoning demand for them. Perhaps the accelerated pace of high-tech equipment installations associated with the large increases in productivity growth in recent years is generating unachievable demands for skilled graduates over the short run. If the apparent acceleration in the demand for skilled workers to staff our high-tech capital stock is temporary, as many presume, the pressure on our schools would ease as would the upward pressure on high-skilled wages. More broadly, in considering the issue of expanding our skilled workforce, some have a gnawing sense that our problems may be more than temporary and that the roots of the problem may extend back through our education system. Many of our students languish at too low a level of skill, and the result is an apparent excess of supply relative to a declining demand. These changing balances are most evident in the failure of real wages at the lower end of our income distribution to rise during the past quarter-century. The hypothesis that we should be able to improve upon the knowledge that our students acquire as they move from kindergarten to twelfth grade gains some support from international comparisons. A study conducted in 1995 revealed that, although our fourth-grade students were above average in both math and science, by the time they reached their last year of high school they had fallen well below the international average. Accordingly, we apparently have quite a distance to go before we catch up. Early last century, technological advance required workers with a higher level of cognitive skills--for instance the ability to read manuals, to interpret blueprints, or to understand formulas. Youth were pulled from rural areas, where opportunities were limited, into more-productive occupations in business and an advancing manufacturing sector. Our educational system responded: In the 1920s and 1930s, high-school enrollment in this country expanded rapidly. It became the job of these institutions to prepare students for work life. In the context of the demands of the economy at that time, a high-school diploma represented the training needed to be successful in most aspects of American enterprise. The economic returns for having a high-school diploma rose and, as a result, high-school enrollment rates climbed. By the time that the United States entered World War II, the median level of education for a seventeen-year-old was a high-school diploma--an accomplishment that set us apart from other countries. I cannot dismiss the notion that we can learn something from that period and perhaps from other countries. Still, I realize that the world was different from today in many ways. Societal changes have been numerous and profound, and our schools are being asked to do a great deal more than they have in the past. We need to be forward-looking in order to adapt our educational system to the evolving needs of the economy and the realities of our changing society. One area in which educational investments appear to have paid off is our community colleges. These two-year institutions are playing a similar role in preparing our students for work life as did our early twentieth-century high schools in that less technically oriented era. But to an even greater extent, our population today is adjusting to an ever-faster turnover of jobs. We are also growing more aware that in the current intensely competitive economy, the pace of job creation and destruction implies that the average work life will span many jobs and even more than one profession. The desire of workers to learn skills that build on their previous work experiences or to acquire new skills is apparent. Currently almost one in three of the enrollees in community colleges and almost one of two part-time enrollees at four-year undergraduate schools are aged thirty or older, statistics that suggest that these individuals have had previous job experience. The increase in these enrollments over the past thirty years attests to the success of these institutions in imparting both general and practical job-related training. A rising proportion of the population is also taking advantage of work-related instruction. More broadly, our system of higher education bears an important responsibility for ensuring that our workforce is prepared for the demands of economic change. America's reputation as the world's leader in higher education is grounded in the ability of these versatile institutions to serve the practical needs of the economy by teaching and training and, more significantly, by unleashing the creative thinking that moves our economy forward. * * * I do not doubt that the vast majority of us would prefer to work in a less stressful, less competitive environment. Yet, in our roles as consumers, we seem to relentlessly seek the low product prices and high quality that are prominent features of our current frenetically competitive economic structure. Retailers who do not choose their suppliers, foreign or domestic, with price and quality uppermost in mind, risk losing their customers to retailers who do. Retailers are afforded little leeway in product sourcing. If consumers are stern taskmasters of their marketplace, business purchasers of capital equipment and production materials inputs have taken the competitive paradigm a step further and applied it on a global scale. Those who have lost jobs as a consequence of this process, I know, are not readily consoled by the fact that job insecurity concerns are not new. But keeping the current period in context is instructive. Jobs in the United States were perceived as migrating to low-wage Japan in the 1950s and 1960s, to low-wage Mexico in the 1990s, and most recently to low-wage China. Japan, of course, is no longer characterized by a low-wage workforce, and many in Mexico are now complaining of job losses to low-wage China. In response to these strains and the dislocations they cause, a new round of protectionist steps is being proposed. These alleged cures would make matters worse rather than better. They would do little to create jobs; and if foreigners were to retaliate, we would surely lose jobs. Besides enhancing education, we need to further open markets here and abroad to allow our workers to compete effectively in the global marketplace. * * * As our economy exhibits increasing signals of recovery, job loss continues to diminish. But new job creation is lagging badly--the ironic consequence of accelerated gains in productivity. In all likelihood, employment will begin to increase more quickly before long as output continues to expand. We have reason to be confident that new jobs will displace old ones as they always have, but America's job-turnover process will never be without pain for those caught on the downside of creative destruction. We do have a choice. We can erect walls to foreign trade and even discourage job-displacing innovation. The pace of competition would surely slow, and tensions might appear to ease. But only for a short while. Our standard of living would soon begin to stagnate and perhaps even decline as a consequence. Time and again through our history, we have discovered that attempting merely to preserve the comfortable features of the present, rather than reaching for new levels of prosperity, is a sure path to stagnation. In closing, I have emphasized the importance of redressing the apparent imbalances between the supply and demand for labor across the spectrum of skills. Those imbalances have the potential to hamper the adjustment flexibility of our economy overall. But these growing imbalances are also aggravating the inequality of incomes in this country. Historically, we have placed much greater emphasis on the need to provide equality of opportunity than on equality of outcomes. But equal opportunity requires equal access to knowledge. We cannot expect everyone to be equally skilled. But we need to pursue equal access to knowledge to ensure that our economic system works at maximum efficiency and is perceived as just in its distribution of rewards.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Education At the Boston College Finance Conference 2004, Boston, Massachusetts March 12, 2004 It was a distinct pleasure a short while ago to accept an honorary degree from this distinguished institution of higher learning. Father Leahy, Chairman Connors, please convey my thanks and appreciation to your Board of Trustees. I can think of no better place than Boston College and no better forum than this conference to address the central role education plays in our nation's economic prosperity. The United States economy has long been characterized by a strong tradition of entrepreneurial spirit among our business people, a high level of skill among our workers, and an openness by firms and workers alike to intense competition within and beyond our borders. Those attributes have given us a standard of living unparalleled for so large a population--and one that has risen steadily over the history of our nation. But with that bounty have also come the inevitable stresses and anxieties that accompany economic advance. One concern that has persisted for some time is the fear that we are irreversibly losing manufacturing jobs because of businesses' efforts to extract rapid gains in production efficiencies and to cut labor costs by tapping the lower-wage economies of Asia and Latin America. More recently, similar concerns have arisen about the possibility that an increasing number of our better-paying white-collar jobs will be lost to outsourcing, especially to India and China. Many of these jobs are in the service sector, and they were previously perceived as secure and largely free from the international competition long faced in the manufacturing sector. There is a palpable unease that businesses and jobs are being drained from the United States, with potentially adverse long-run implications for employment and the standard of living of the average American. Job insecurity is understandably significant when nearly two million members of our workforce have been unemployed for more than six months. The issue is both important and sensitive, dealing as it does with the longer-term wealth of our nation and with the immediate welfare of so many individuals and communities. In the debate that has ensued, a large gulf is often perceived between the arguments of economists, who almost always point to the considerable benefits offered over the long term by exposure to free and open trade, and the obvious stress felt by those caught on the downside of turbulence created by that exposure. It is crucial that this gulf be bridged. As history clearly shows, our economy is best served by full and vigorous engagement in the global economy. Consequently, we need to increase our efforts to ensure that as many of our citizens as possible have the opportunity to capture the benefits that flow from that engagement. For reasons that I shall elucidate shortly, one critical element in creating that opportunity is to provide rigorous education and ongoing training to all members of our society. This proposal is not novel; it is, in fact, the strategy that we have followed successfully for most of the past century and a strategy that we now should embrace with renewed commitment. Over the long sweep of American generations and waves of economic change, we simply have not experienced a net drain of jobs to advancing technology or to other nations. Since the end of World War II, for example, the unemployment rate in the United States has averaged less than 6 percent with no apparent trend; and as recently as 2000, it dipped below 4 percent. Moreover, real earnings of the average worker have continued to rise. Over the past century, per capita real income has risen at an average rate of more than 2 percent per year, declining notably only during the Great Depression of the 1930s and immediately following World War II. Incomes trended higher whether we had a trade deficit or a trade surplus and whether international outsourcing was large or small. More fundamental economic forces have apparently been at work. Research on wealth creation in both emerging and developed nations strongly suggests that it is the knowledge and the skill of our population interacting under our rule of law that determine our real incomes, irrespective of the specific jobs in which these incomes are earned and irrespective of the proportion of domestic consumption met by imports. These upward trends in the standard of living, however, mask the stress that significant parts of our workforce endure. Joseph Schumpeter, the renowned Harvard professor, called the process of progress "creative destruction," the continuous scrapping of old technologies to make way for the new. Standards of living rise because the cash flows of industries employing older, increasingly obsolescent, technologies are marshaled, along with new savings, to finance the production of capital assets that almost always embody cutting-edge technologies. Workers migrate with the capital. This is the process by which wealth is created, incremental step by incremental step. The process of creative destruction has been accompanied by an ever-growing conceptualization of economic output. Ideas rather than materials or physical brawn have been by far the greatest contributors during the past half-century to our average annual increase of 3-1/4 percent in real gross domestic product. Technological advance is continually altering the shape, nature, and complexity of our economic processes. To effectively manage this ever-increasing complexity, our labor force has had to become more and more technically oriented. Years of schooling, a rough proxy for skills, averaged nine and one-quarter years in 1950. A half-century later, schooling averaged more than twelve years. At the risk of some oversimplification, if the skill composition of our workforce meshed fully with the needs of our increasingly complex capital stock, wage-skill differentials would be stable, and percentage changes in wage rates would be the same for all job grades. This was largely the case through the 1960s when the addition of skilled college graduates to the labor force, in part the result of schooling financed by the GI Bill, was sufficient to hold wage increases among the highly skilled to average gains. Real wages of the lesser skilled also rose significantly, in part as a result of effective high-school educations and the many skills learned during the war. In the 1970s, the supply of skilled workers received another boost from the rapid expansion of our nation's community colleges. In short, technical proficiencies across all job grade levels appeared to rise about in line with the needs of our, even then, complex stock of capital. But for the past twenty years the real incomes of skilled, especially highly skilled, workers have risen more than the average of all workers, whereas real wage rate increases for lesser-skilled workers have been below average, indeed virtually nonexistent. This difference in wage trends suggests that, at least in relative terms, we have developed a shortage of highly skilled workers and a surplus of lesser-skilled workers. Although in recent years the proportion of our labor force made up of those with at least some college education has continued to grow, we appear, nonetheless, to be graduating too few skilled workers to address the apparent imbalance between the supply of such workers and the burgeoning demand for them. Perhaps the accelerated pace of high-tech equipment installations associated with the large increases in productivity growth in recent years is generating unachievable demands for skilled graduates over the short run. If the apparent acceleration in the demand for skilled workers to staff our high-tech capital stock is temporary, as many presume, the pressure on our schools would ease as would the upward pressure on high-skilled wages. More broadly, in considering the issue of expanding our skilled workforce, some have a gnawing sense that our problems may be more than temporary and that the roots of the problem may extend back through our education system. Many of our students languish at too low a level of skill, and the result is an apparent excess of supply relative to a declining demand. These changing balances are most evident in the failure of real wages at the lower end of our income distribution to rise during the past quarter-century. The hypothesis that we should be able to improve upon the knowledge that our students acquire as they move from kindergarten to twelfth grade gains some support from international comparisons. A study conducted in 1995 by the Lynch School of Education here at Boston College revealed that, although our fourth-grade students were above average in both math and science, by the time they reached their last year of high school they had fallen well below the international average. Accordingly, we apparently have quite a distance to go before we catch up. Early last century, technological advance required workers with a higher level of cognitive skills--for instance the ability to read manuals, to interpret blueprints, or to understand formulas. Youth were pulled from rural areas, where opportunities were limited, into more-productive occupations in business and an advancing manufacturing sector. Our educational system responded: In the 1920s and 1930s, high-school enrollment in this country expanded rapidly. It became the job of these institutions to prepare students for work life. In the context of the demands of the economy at that time, a high-school diploma represented the training needed to be successful in most aspects of American enterprise. The economic returns for having a high-school diploma rose and, as a result, high-school enrollment rates climbed. By the time that the United States entered World War II, the median level of education for a seventeen-year-old was a high-school diploma--an accomplishment that set us apart from other countries. I cannot dismiss the notion that we can learn something from that period and perhaps from other countries. Still, I realize that the world was different from today in many ways. Societal changes have been numerous and profound, and our schools are being asked to do a great deal more than they have in the past. We need to be forward-looking in order to adapt our educational system to the evolving needs of the economy and the realities of our changing society. One area in which educational investments appear to have paid off is our community colleges. These two-year institutions are playing a similar role in preparing our students for work life as did our early twentieth-century high schools in that less technically oriented era. But to an even greater extent, our population today is adjusting to an ever-faster turnover of jobs. We are also growing more aware that in the current intensely competitive economy, the pace of job creation and destruction implies that the average work life will span many jobs and even more than one profession. The desire of workers to learn skills that build on their previous work experiences or to acquire new skills is apparent. Currently almost one in three of the enrollees in community colleges and almost one of two part-time enrollees at four-year undergraduate schools are aged thirty or older, statistics that suggest that these individuals have had previous job experience. The increase in these enrollments over the past thirty years attests to the success of these institutions in imparting both general and practical job-related training. A rising proportion of the population is also taking advantage of work-related instruction. More broadly, our system of higher education bears an important responsibility for ensuring that our workforce is prepared for the demands of economic change. America's reputation as the world's leader in higher education is grounded in the ability of these versatile institutions to serve the practical needs of the economy by teaching and training and, more significantly, by unleashing the creative thinking that moves our economy forward. * * * I do not doubt that the vast majority of us would prefer to work in a less stressful, less competitive environment. Yet, in our roles as consumers, we seem to relentlessly seek the low product prices and high quality that are prominent features of our current frenetically competitive economic structure. Retailers who do not choose their suppliers, foreign or domestic, with price and quality uppermost in mind, risk losing their customers to retailers who do. Retailers are afforded little leeway in product sourcing. If consumers are stern taskmasters of their marketplace, business purchasers of capital equipment and production materials inputs have taken the competitive paradigm a step further and applied it on a global scale. Those who have lost jobs as a consequence of this process, I know, are not readily consoled by the fact that job insecurity concerns are not new. But keeping the current period in context is instructive. Jobs in the United States were perceived as migrating to low-wage Japan in the 1950s and 1960s, to low-wage Mexico in the 1990s, and most recently to low-wage China. Japan, of course, is no longer characterized by a low-wage workforce, and many in Mexico are now complaining of job losses to low-wage China. In response to these strains and the dislocations they cause, a new round of protectionist steps is being proposed. These alleged cures would make matters worse rather than better. They would do little to create jobs; and if foreigners were to retaliate, we would surely lose jobs. Besides enhancing education, we need to further open markets here and abroad to allow our workers to compete effectively in the global marketplace. * * * As our economy exhibits increasing signals of recovery, job loss continues to diminish. But new job creation is lagging badly--the ironic consequence of accelerated gains in productivity. In all likelihood, employment will begin to increase more quickly before long as output continues to expand. We have reason to be confident that new jobs will displace old ones as they always have, but America's job-turnover process will never be without pain for those caught on the downside of creative destruction. We do have a choice. We can erect walls to foreign trade and even discourage job-displacing innovation. The pace of competition would surely slow, and tensions might appear to ease. But only for a short while. Our standard of living would soon begin to stagnate and perhaps even decline as a consequence. Time and again through our history, we have discovered that attempting merely to preserve the comfortable features of the present, rather than reaching for new levels of prosperity, is a sure path to stagnation. In closing, I have emphasized the importance of redressing the apparent imbalances between the supply and demand for labor across the spectrum of skills. Those imbalances have the potential to hamper the adjustment flexibility of our economy overall. But these growing imbalances are also aggravating the inequality of incomes in this country. To be sure, a hallmark of our market-based economy has been that we have placed much greater emphasis on the need to provide equality of opportunity than on equality of outcomes. But equal opportunity requires equal access to knowledge. We cannot expect everyone to be equally skilled. But we need to pursue equal access to knowledge to ensure that our economic system works at maximum efficiency and is perceived as just in its distribution of rewards.

Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Banking Before the Independent Community Bankers of America Convention, San Diego, California (via satellite) March 17, 2004 It is a pleasure once again to participate in the annual meeting of the Independent Community Bankers Association. I particularly hoped to attend this meeting in person, but events made such a trip infeasible. I wanted to be at your meeting to join in honoring the contributions of Ken Guenther. As everyone knows who has ever received Ken's notes--known fondly to one and all as "Guenther-grams"--he thinks deeply and broadly about banking and financial matters. Having reflected on the kinds of issues that Ken has on his mind, I thought it would be fitting today if I shared with you some ideas about where the banking industry is today and about a few trends we see evolving. Asset Growth and Quality The weakness in credit quality that accompanied the recent recession has clearly been mild for the banking system as a whole, and the system remains strong and well positioned to meet customer needs for credit and other financial services. During the past three years or so, the industry extended its string of high and often record quarterly earnings, retained its historically high equity and risk-based capital ratios, and generally enjoyed robust asset growth. The industry and its supervisors had begun exceptionally early to address slippage in credit standards that accompanied the maturing of the last expansion, and their timely intervention was reflected in modest subsequent write-offs relative to earnings. Indeed, for each of the past several quarters the volume of problem assets at commercial banks has declined, and the size and the number of bank failures in recent years have been exceptionally small. Although the demand for business loans has remained weak, the banking industry has continued to benefit from strong demand for household credit, not least for residential mortgage products. The outlook for asset quality is also favorable. As economic activity continues to grow and businesses become more confident about their customers' demands, business loan demand should increase, and pressures on banking margins should begin to ease. During the period of weakness and recovery, quite a large amount of core deposits flowed back into banks of all sizes reflecting lower interest rates on alternative assets, the softness of the stock market, and the public's desire for safe assets. As a result, banks had ample liquidity and the resources to fund asset growth. More recently, with renewed interest in market securities and a slowing of mortgage re-financings--and their associated buildup in deposits--core deposits have weakened. History suggests that, as the economy strengthens further, deposit substitutes again will become more attractive to bank customers, requiring competitive responses in bank deposit offering rates and reliance on non-core sources. Community bankers in the last half of the nineties demonstrated their skill in competing successfully in such markets. Although their deposit patterns have been similar, community and larger banks have seen some interesting differences developing in their portfolios in the past two or three years that are worth noting. Banking commentary generally has emphasized the extent to which residential mortgage finance and consumer credit extensions have dominated the portfolio expansion of the banking industry. In fact, that growth, which dominates the aggregate statistics, has been mainly a large bank phenomenon. At community banks, the residential mortgage, credit card, and consumer installment loan portfolios have declined in each of the last three years. To be sure, this change may be a matter of choice. The data suggest, for example, that community banks have originated a significant volume of mortgage loans for securitization by others, continuing to acquire in the process a large amount of mortgage-backed securities. But some observers have noted that in the market for new originations of mortgages community banks are also under continued competitive pressure from mortgage bankers, nationwide mortgage lenders, and real estate agent relationships with out-of-market lenders, often through the Internet. The declining importance of traditional consumer credit business at community banks appears to stem from both sustained competition from captive finance companies and community banks' withdrawal from the credit card market, where significant scale is required to service the resultant portfolios. Community bankers, however, continue to have success with home equity loans as a substitute for more traditional consumer lending and have experienced growth in such loans comparable to that at larger institutions. Particularly noteworthy is the longer-term trend at community banks that seems to have accelerated in the past three years--the increasing share of asset growth accounted for by nonresidential real estate finance, particularly construction and land development loans and commercial and industrial real estate financing. Last year these categories accounted for more than 90 percent of the net asset growth of banks with less than $1 billion in assets; multifamily real estate and farmland finance would bring the total to more than 100 percent, offsetting the declines in other categories. Such credit exposures are a natural evolution of community banking and are quite profitable, helping to sustain both the earnings and growing equity capital of community banks. Moreover, the evidence suggests that community banks have avoided the underwriting mistakes that led to so many problems ten to fifteen years ago. Borrower equity is much higher and credit criteria are much stricter. In the last recession and during the early weak recovery, we saw very few delinquencies in these credits. Nonetheless, bankers need to be aware of the historical real estate cycle that, in the past, placed such exposures under severe stress. One hopes these improvements in underwriting standards are lasting. But the painful lessons of banking history underscore the ever-present need for vigilance in managing geographic and business line concentrations. Consolidation Mergers and acquisitions in banking continue, driven by technology, reduced barriers to entry, relaxation of interstate banking restrictions, and globalization. Although attention has been focused on the larger banks, roughly 90 percent of mergers over the past decade have involved a target with less than $1 billion; three-quarters have involved an acquiree with assets of less than $250 million. Largely as a consequence, the number of banking organizations with assets of less than $1 billion has fallen since the mid-1990s by more than one-fifth. Neither the aggregate decline in the number of banking organizations of all sizes nor the increase in aggregate concentration ratios tells us much about the competitive effects of consolidation. Competition in banking is fought on the battlefield of the local market, especially for households and small and medium-sized businesses. By that test, concentration in local markets has actually declined somewhat since the mid-1990s in both urban and rural local markets. The apparent contradiction between aggregate consolidation and the virtually unchanged local market structure reflects the fact that many of the mergers and acquisitions by all sizes of banks have been out-of-market, or geographic-expansion, mergers. In addition, when consolidation occurs, it often induces de novo entry to take advantage of the inefficiencies or transition difficulties of the newly consolidated enterprise. Over the past five years, for every four bank mergers that have been approved, three de novo bank charters have been granted. To be sure, expansion by large banks through acquisitions and branching has increased the number of local markets--urban and rural--in which a large institution is a rival. Last year, 99 percent of the urban markets and 54 percent of the rural markets had an office of a banking organization with deposits of $25 billion or more. Such an increase in the presence of large banking organizations at the local level has occurred while community banks continue to face competition from thrifts, credit unions, securities firms, and loan production offices from out-of-market lenders, not to mention the Internet. These trends are irreversible. Nonetheless, as evidenced by their performance, community banks have the competitive skill of innovation and the competitive edge of local market knowledge not just to survive against such competition but to continue to prosper. Basel II Every indication to date also suggests that the proposed application of Basel II in the United States to only large banks should not be a matter of concern to community bankers. Indeed, your comments on our proposal to revise the Basel Accord suggest that you are comfortable, to say the least, with not having to invest in the institutional infrastructure to be required of the largest banks. The agencies believe that the generally strong capital position and straightforward balance sheets of most of the other banks make a wider application of Basel II neither cost effective nor necessary on prudential grounds. Of course, supervisors will continue reviewing credit-granting and risk-management policies at banks of all sizes, and I suspect that, in the years ahead, market-driven spin-offs from the new procedures at larger banks will be adopted by community banks. Apparently another fear exists. The comments received from some of you indicated a concern that perhaps the lower regulatory capital that some large banks may incur under Basel II on some portfolios may distort the competitive balance between adopters and non-adopters of the proposed new accord. The banking agencies and the Congress take such risks seriously. Indeed, we have indicated that if we see evidence supporting competitive distortions, we will make the necessary modifications to blunt them by doing one of the following: changing Basel II rules in the United States, where national discretion is allowed; modifying the proposed U.S. bifurcated application; or changing the capital rules that apply to non-adopters. In short, if we have evidence of a potential competitive problem, we will not be precluded from proposing any measure that we believe is necessary to retain a more level playing field. Two weeks ago, the Federal Reserve published the first two of four empirical studies on this issue that our staff is conducting. One addresses the concern that regulatory capital reductions at adopters of Basel II might induce more mergers and acquisitions, with the adopters acquiring the non-adopters. That paper finds little empirical evidence that, in the past, excess regulatory capital at the acquirer had been a significant factor in boosting consolidation. The second paper evaluates the fear that the lower on average, risk-based capital charges on loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises by Basel II adopters would put non-adopters at a competitive disadvantage. This study concludes that the empirical evidence suggests that, indeed, a competitive issue in this market might arise between adopters and large bank non-adopters, both of which make the same types of loans in the same markets. This potential effect must be addressed. But the study also concludes that, on the basis of empirical review, the types of small business loans generally made by community banks--relationship-based loans, which community banks do so well--are so different from the types of loans made by larger banks, and so differently priced, that the competitive effects on community banks of Basel II application to large banks are likely to be insignificant. Two other studies, exploring the competitive effects in the residential mortgage and credit card markets will be available in the next few months. The results of all four studies will be reviewed when we conduct later this year another Quantitative Impact Study on the revised Basel II now being developed. And, again, if updates of the completed studies or the analyses in the new studies demonstrate competitive problems, we will modify the proposals to address them. Summary In summary, the banking system is in a strong and profitable position to finance the credit demands of the current expansion. As that expansion continues, both large and community banks will have to once again look beyond their core deposit base to fund those demands. The competitive environment for banks, especially community banks, will continue to intensify. Both history and current behavior suggest, however, that community banks can innovate and meet these competitive challenges. The merger trends of both large and small banks will undoubtedly continue, but both public policy and new entry will also continue to limit concentration in local markets. If evidence shows that a bifurcated application of Basel II would distort competitive markets in the United States, the agencies are pledged to make whatever modifications are necessary to either the proposal or the current capital rules. And, finally, once again: Ken, I wish you a productive and enjoyable retirement.

Remarks by Governor Edward M. Gramlich At the Federal Reserve Board Models and Monetary Policy Conference, Washington, D.C. March 26, 2004 The Board's Modeling Work in the 1960s I am delighted to be speaking at a conference honoring Dale Henderson, Dick Porter, and Peter Tinsley. I remember all of them from long ago. Peter and I joined the Board staff in September 1965, when Pat Hendershott and Bob Parry also joined. At least in terms of longevity, that was a pretty significant hiring month. I remember being on a panel with Dick at an academic conference in those days. He had not yet joined the Board, being an assistant professor at Ohio State. Being thoroughly a Michigan man now, I probably should not admit it, but I also met him, along with Dave Lindsey, when I interviewed for a job at Ohio State. The job interview didn't pan out, I think mainly on my side but perhaps on theirs too. I also knew Dale back then. He joined the Board shortly after I left, but I met him socially in the early 1970s. Frankly, I still remember one thing he said to me. When I mentioned that I used to be on the Board's staff, he said he knew--he had read some of my stuff. "Well," I said expectantly. "Oh, some of it's OK," he said. With his subsequent international exposure, Dale has gotten much more diplomatic over the years. All three principals have made great contributions to economic modeling at the Board. Peter started with optimal control techniques and distributed lags, and continued with rational expectations estimation procedures. Dick's work focused on money demand and monetary control techniques. Dale was instrumental in developing the Board's global model. All three have generally promoted research at the Board, helped younger scholars get established, sponsored working paper series, and fought for better computers and other support. As for the models themselves, the topic of the conference, I feel like Rip Van Winkle. In the very early days, 1965-70, I was here and indeed right in the middle of the producer side of the model work. Then I went off and did other things for twenty-seven years, returning in 1997 as a consumer of models. Things changed a lot in those twenty-seven years. Most of you are reasonably familiar with what the model looks like now. But apart from the real graybeards, the three principals and I, most of you were probably in grade school when this work actually started. Let me recall a few stories from the old days. The main motivator at the Board in those days was Frank de Leeuw. For all who knew Frank, he was one of the most "market undervalued" economists of all time. All the young people at the Fed then felt he walked on water. Frank formed a team of economists here--Tinsley, Hendershott, Al Tella, and me among others--and an academic team featuring the late Franco Modigliani from MIT and the late Albert Ando from Penn. Bob Rasche, now research director at the St. Louis Fed, and Harold Shapiro, later to be my university president at Michigan, were also junior professors at Penn and part of the team. Jerry Enzler, whom many of you remember fondly, as I do, was somewhere in transition, starting as a Penn graduate student and moving to the Board staff, where he too stayed many years. The model we put together in those days has been enshrined in publications and I won't describe it much. It probably had about the coverage of the present day FRBUS, and it had many of the then exotic channels of monetary policy. There was a consumption-wealth effect working through equity values and housing values, and both of those prices were endogenous. At one point, Franco got one of his graduate students, a lively kid named Larry Meyer, to do his thesis on this link. There was a foreign sector, but exchange rates were exogenous because we had pegged rates back then. There was also a credit-rationing channel based largely on the work of another Franco graduate student, Dwight Jaffee, who is now an authority on government-sponsored enterprises at Berkeley. What we didn't have in those days was forward-looking expectations behavior. In qualitative terms we all knew the difference between adaptive and rational expectations, but nobody knew how to estimate rational expectations equations. This is one area where technical work over the years has made a large difference, and I gather that several people in the room, especially Peter Tinsley, have been responsible. In more immediate terms, the aspect of the model that still recalls frustration was that whenever we ran dynamic full-model simulations, the simulations would blow up. I can't tell you how many hours Jerry Enzler and I spent feeding in our regression cards, and our simulation cards, to work on this issue. Yes, we fed in punch cards in those days. Nowadays when Board economists present the results of dynamic simulations in briefings, and the simulations look very reasonable, I think I am one of the few people in the room who is deeply impressed. Doctrinal historians will have fun with the naming of this model. Whenever Board people wrote about it, it was the Fed-MIT model, or perhaps the Fed-MIT-Penn model. When Ando wrote it became the MPS model--MIT-Penn-Social Science Research Council model. All the Social Science Research Council did was to give Ando a grant. And where was the Fed? We did do a lot of the early work on the model. A number of people have raised questions about monetary and fiscal policy itself in the 1960s--how could policy have been so misguided? First off, let me say that the modeling group was quite aware of the natural rate hypothesis then. We knew that an adaptive expectations Phillips Curve would explode if the lag coefficient was one--we just couldn't get its estimated value to be one. We had yet to apply Kalman filters or other split-sample techniques and were yet to realize the problems with the sum of the lagged coefficients test. But even apart from lag effects, as papers by Bill Poole (another Division of Research and Statistics staff member from those days), George de Menil (another Franco student), and Jerry Enzler show, our nonlinear Phillips Curves became very, very steep at low unemployment rates, implying that inflation would become uncontrollable at low unemployment rates. On the point Athanasios Orphanides raises about the value of the natural rate, we probably were wrong about that. I remember being stunned by a Bob Hall paper in the 1970s that placed the natural rate at about 5 percent. By the way, in the mid-1970s Franco began calling this rate NIRU, and later Jim Tobin, I think, switched it over to NAIRU. But the main problems with policy in those days were, um, with the policymakers. First off, presidential interference on discount rate policy got the discount rate set below the funds rate in 1965, a problem we never fixed until two years ago. I think this artificially low discount rate may have held down the funds rate, leading to the overly expansionary monetary policy amply documented by John Taylor. It was obvious to virtually all economists that the country needed a permanent budget shift as Vietnam spending increased, but what came out of that was a delayed temporary tax increase. Anything else would have made the war less popular, and by then the Vietnam War was pretty darn unpopular. Quite possibly, our intellectual understanding was not where it should have been in the late 1960s, but 90 percent of the policy problems were political, with the policymakers themselves. These days the Board staff makes a baseline forecast and grafts on FRBUS to get the results for alternative scenarios. We actually began to do these types of experiments once our model was put together in the late 1960s. I was dying to present the results to the Board, but never could get past Lyle Gramley, our sponsor but also our gatekeeper. He didn't trust the model enough when it was used as a pure forecasting device. Then, as I suppose now, we had the most trouble forecasting equipment investment--most of the other final demand sectors worked pretty well. The investment accelerator was also the reason our dynamic simulations ran off-track. When we would suspend the investment equation, things would work reasonably well. I have heard the modern day staff complain about estimating an accelerator effect for equipment and software and, believe me, I am sympathetic. Another place where the intervening years have made a real difference is the way in which the baseline forecast itself was put together. In our day it was totally anticipations data--leading indicators of this or that, for a quarter or two ahead at most. Today I hear Dave Stockton describe the baseline forecast in very model-oriented terms--this effect, that coefficient, and so forth. Nowadays the baseline forecast also runs out a few years, something the judgmental forecasters of earlier days would never have attempted, and it even has measures of forecast uncertainty. All of these are real improvements, far beyond what was done in the 1960s. For me, this work all came to an end in May 1970. At the time I felt we had brought the model as far as I thought we could bring it, at least for a while, and I really wanted to do some other kind of economics. Whether the external pastures were in fact greener I will never know--they just seemed greener at the time. So I left the Board staff, confident that I would never return either to the Board or to large-scale macro modeling. But sure enough, there were some other twists of fate and here I am, back, as a model consumer. And, I think, an ideal consumer because I realize how hard it is to do this kind of work.
Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke At the Federal Reserve Board Models and Monetary Policy Conference, Washington, D.C. March 27, 2004 Monetary Policy Modeling: Where Are We and Where Should We Be Going? Our honorees, Dale Henderson, Richard Porter, and Peter Tinsley, have already received much well-deserved praise. I will add only one brief observation. Although I am a relative newcomer to the Federal Reserve, I have already had numerous occasions to be impressed by the research staff here. The Board staff has what a management expert might call a terrific corporate culture. They understand that they make crucial contributions to the policymaking process, not only in the realm of monetary policy but in banking, payments, consumer affairs, and other areas, and they bring great pride and professionalism to their work. Moreover, they understand the value of sophisticated and subtle economic analysis, which they apply both to day-to-day questions of policy and to more fundamental research questions. A culture like that doesn't just happen; it requires senior people who lead by example. In their times at the Board, Dale Henderson, Dick Porter, and Peter Tinsley, each in his own way, have promoted a culture that combines the best in policy-oriented research with the intellectual rigor and curiosity needed to address questions that go beyond the immediate economic situation. That is an outstanding contribution, one that should be recognized in addition to the many intellectual contributions that each of these scholars has made to the economic literature. The theme of the panel is "Monetary Policy Modeling: Where Are We and Where Should We Be Going?" Forecasting the direction of successful research is inherently very difficult. There is a kind of efficient markets principle at work; if a promising direction for research were obvious, someone would have already pursued it. So I think the best I can do is highlight three general areas in which much good work has already been done, including research by Messrs. Henderson, Porter, and Tinsley, but in which further progress would be enormously helpful to monetary policymaking in practice. The first area is the characterization of good monetary policy in increasingly realistic and complex model environments. Henderson, Porter, and Tinsley have all made significant contributions to macroeconomic modeling at the Board. For specificity, I will focus on a piece of recent research that I like very much and which has already received much attention at this conference: Dale Henderson's paper with Christopher Erceg and Andrew Levin (2003). We have learned a great deal in recent years about the effects of monetary policy in dynamic, stochastic, sticky-price models, with Michael Woodford's recent book (Woodford, 2003) perhaps best representing the state of the art. This line of research is potentially of great importance to applied macro modelers, because it addresses areas in which some may feel that our current policy models need to be strengthened, notably the treatment of expectations, the specification of model dynamics, and the relationship of the economic structure to the form of the policy rule. However, naturally enough, the earliest models in this genre have tended to be highly simplified representations of the economy, only loosely matched to the data. Like the models themselves, the optimal policy rules derived in the models are often unrealistically simple. For example, in some of these models, strict inflation targeting--a policy of keeping inflation at zero at all times--is the optimal policy. To make these models relevant for applied policy analysis, the natural next step is to add new frictions and more complex dynamics to the benchmark models. The Erceg-Henderson-Levin (EHL) paper explores the implications for monetary policy of a plausible complication, the inclusion in the model of nominal wage stickiness as well as price stickiness. As was discussed yesterday, this relatively simple addition makes an important qualitative difference in the policy results. Specifically, in the EHL model, monetary policy can no longer achieve a fully optimal outcome but instead faces tradeoffs among its objectives. Because the optimal rule in their model is relatively complex and depends on model parameters and shocks, EHL use model simulations to examine the performance of some simple policy rules. Interestingly, they find that relatively simple policy strategies can achieve results close to the optimum. The contribution of the EHL paper goes beyond the specific findings; equally important is the direction that this work sets for the collective research program. Erceg, Henderson, and Levin have shown by example that incorporating additional, realistic frictions into the basic new-Keynesian model changes both the behavior of the model and the nature of the optimal policy rule in nontrivial ways. The papers at this conference by Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2004) and by Benigno and Woodford (2004) both take up the EHL challenge. For example, Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba consider further complications of the sticky-price, sticky-wage model, including capital investment and habit formation in consumption, while Benigno and Woodford explore the case in which the steady state of the model is not Pareto optimal, as assumed by EHL. This progressive analysis of the implications of alternative assumptions is part of what Thomas Kuhn called "normal science." The insights from these types of modeling efforts are already informing policy analysis at the Board, and their influence will only grow as they become more detailed and realistic. A second important area, one that will always be central to monetary policy, is macro forecasting. Because monetary policy works with a lag, the ability of policymakers to stabilize the economy depends critically on our ability to peer into our cloudy crystal balls and see something resembling the future. One of the key variables to be forecast is inflation. A variety of approaches to forecasting inflation are used at the Board, of course. One of Dick Porter's many contributions was to develop a monetary approach to forecasting inflation at medium-term horizons. Dick's so-called P-star approach, originally developed with Jeffrey Hallman and David Small (1991) and updated in a 2000 paper with Athanasios Orphanides, combines simplicity with insight. Porter's analysis begins with an equation so basic that, at one time at least, it appeared on the California license plate of Milton Friedman's personal automobile. That equation is of course the quantity equation, MV = PY, or money times velocity equals the price level times output. This equation can be used to define a link between money growth and inflation that depends on the evolution of the velocity of money. Hallman, Porter, and Small (1991) analyzed the predictive power of that relationship under the assumption that M2 velocity is a constant--an assumption that seemed reasonable at the time they wrote, but, as these things are wont to do, broke down soon after they did their initial work. Orphanides and Porter (2000) have developed a more sophisticated version of the P-star model, which employs information about the opportunity cost of holding M2 to track the evolution of equilibrium M2 velocity. This approach seems to work reasonably well at predicting inflation at medium-term horizons, and the forecasts of this model are reported routinely to the Board of Governors. Of course, something very similar to Porter's approach was used by the Bundesbank prior to the formation of the euro area and is used by the European Central Bank today. My own view is that a reliable macroeconomic forecast requires looking at many different types of economic data and considering a variety of forecasting models; any single model or approach is likely to go off the rails at one time or another. For this reason, I am personally attracted to factor models, which summarize large amounts of data (as in Bernanke and Boivin, 2003), and to model averaging, along with more structured analyses. Interesting alternative models, like Porter's P-star model, are useful because they give yet another perspective on the likely evolution of a critical macroeconomic variable and thus provide a check on other forecasts that one might have in hand. Because good forecasts are so crucial to good monetary policy, I hope and expect to see a great deal more work exploring the robustness of alternative forecasting methods. The third and final research area that I would like to highlight is the analysis of how the public forms its expectations, and of the effects of various expectations formation mechanisms on macroeconomic dynamics. For example, a rich recent literature on learning and macroeconomics has emphasized that actual inflation and inflation expectations may to some degree evolve independently, and that effective monetary policy stabilizes inflation expectations as well as inflation itself (Orphanides and Williams, 2003). Peter Tinsley, in a series of papers with Sharon Kozicki, has explored this theme in great detail. For example, Kozicki and Tinsley (2001) show that it is far easier to make sense of the term structure of Treasury yields if one assumes that expectations about long-run inflation adjust in a reasonable adaptive manner. In a paper presented at a recent conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Kozicki and Tinsley (2003) develop an empirical model of the economy under the assumptions that the Fed's implicit inflation target is subject to permanent shocks and that the public learns about the Fed's target over time. Although simple, their model allows for a much richer and realistic description of the evolution of monetary policy and the economy. For example, their approach gives empirical content to the idea of imperfect monetary policy credibility; in their model, monetary policy is credible when private expectations of long-run inflation tend to align closely with the central bank's true underlying inflation target. Their model also illustrates clearly the benefits of central bank credibility for macroeconomic stability. I think that further theoretical and empirical work on expectations formation mechanisms and their links to economic dynamics will prove highly fruitful. I will conclude by thanking the organizers for their hard work in putting together this conference. A research conference of the quality of this one is exactly the right way to honor the scholarly contributions of Dale, Dick, and Peter.

Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke At the Distinguished Speaker Series, Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina March 30, 2004 Trade and Jobs Economists are often accused of not being able to agree on anything. Although we are indeed a contentious bunch, one proposition commands almost unanimous assent within the economics community. That proposition is that free trade among nations promotes economic prosperity. The economist's argument for free trade is disarmingly simple. Trade is beneficial because it facilitates the division of labor, allowing each person to specialize in the type of production at which he or she is relatively most efficient. At the most basic level, a world in which each person produced everything that he or she consumed would be primitive indeed, as no single person or family in isolation could produce more than a few rudimentary goods and services. In contrast, if each person concentrates on just a few activities, economies of scale and the development of specialized skills allow production to become much more efficient. Thus, if each of us focuses our efforts on just a few types of production and then trades our output with others, we can enjoy a far more varied and abundant supply of goods and services than we could if each person remained an isolated economic unit. Moreover, specialization tends to encourage innovation and hence promotes dynamism and growth as well as efficiency. What applies to individuals would seem to apply to nations as well. Two centuries ago the economist David Ricardo famously observed that, if England specializes in making cloth while Portugal specializes in producing wine, international trade allows both countries to enjoy more of both goods than would be possible if each country produced only for domestic consumption and did not trade. A telling confirmation of Ricardo's insight is that, when nations go to war, the first order of business is often for each combatant to try to block the other's access to trade. The Union won the Civil War in large part because its blockade of Southern ports prevented the Confederacy from exporting its cotton, and the outcomes of both World War I and World War II turned on the fact that Great Britain and its allies were able to disrupt German trade more successfully than Germany's submarines could impede the flow of goods into and out of Great Britain. Despite what seems to economists to be a compelling case for trade, non-economists are far more skeptical. A perennial public concern, from the emergence of the "Rust Belt" in the 1980s, to the days of Ross Perot's "giant sucking sound," to the more recent debate about the effects of international outsourcing, is that the expansion of trade will cause production to move abroad, at the expense of domestic employment. Such worries become particularly acute at times like the present, when the labor market is weak and net job creation is depressed. From an economist's perspective, focusing on the impact of trade on jobs alone is unduly narrow, as many of the benefits of trade accrue to consumers, in the form of greater access to goods and services, rather than to producers. Nevertheless, employment is certainly an important issue, particularly given recent experience. In my remarks today I will explore the much-debated connection between trade and jobs. I will begin by asking whether trade in general destroys jobs, then consider the specific case of trade in business services, often referred to as outsourcing abroad or "offshoring." Broadly, I will argue that, although trade in general, and outsourcing abroad in particular, may bring with them structural change in the economy, they are not the principal reason for the current underperformance of the labor market. Rather, the sources of slow job creation are primarily domestic. I will conclude by discussing the role of government policies in addressing both the current weakness of the U.S. labor market and the plight of displaced workers. I should note before beginning that the views I express today are not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve. Does Trade Destroy Jobs? Does trade destroy jobs? Increases in trade or changes in trading patterns can indeed destroy some specific jobs. People here in North Carolina are all too aware that increased foreign competition has been a factor in the loss of jobs recently experienced in textiles, furniture, and other industries. These job losses can loom large in specific industries and geographic areas, creating hardships for affected workers, their families, and their communities. The appropriate social and political response to these undeniable job losses is a critical issue, one to which I will return. For now, however, I will point out that although trade does lead to the loss of jobs in some industries and locations, trade also creates jobs, both directly and indirectly. Directly, trade creates jobs in the United States by expanding the potential market for U.S. goods and services. To take one leading example, in 2003 the United States exported $47 billion in civilian aircraft, parts, and engines, while importing only $24 billion, for a trade surplus of $23 billion in that category. More relevant to North Carolina, U.S. agriculture sends much of its product abroad. For example, in the 2002-03 crop year, the United States exported 53 percent of its total wheat production, 69 percent of its output of cotton, 50 percent of its sorghum, 59 percent of rice production, 38 percent of the soybean crop, and 11 percent of its output of meat and poultry. Clearly, farmers benefit greatly from having access to international markets. Reflecting American creativity in the arts and in technology, in 2003 the United States ran a surplus of $28 billion in royalty payments and licensing fees. Trade also creates jobs indirectly, in a variety of ways. First, trade allows firms to obtain inputs to production that are cheaper, of higher quality, or both, than would be possible if all inputs were produced domestically. For example, imports of high-tech equipment have helped many U.S. firms, including large numbers of small businesses, to reduce costs and improve productivity, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in world markets. Obviously, firms that cannot compete in the world marketplace will not be able to provide jobs at home. Second, although imports may compete with domestic production, they also improve the lot of consumers by giving them better variety in and better prices for the goods and services they buy. Moreover, the savings that consumers enjoy because of the availability of lower-cost imports effectively increase household purchasing power, extra income that can be spent on other goods and services, including those produced domestically. Finally, openness to trade also means openness to international flows of capital. Foreign investments in the United States may be in a physical form (for example, BMW's factory in South Carolina) or in a financial form (for example, foreign purchases of the stock and bond offerings of U.S. companies). Either type of foreign investment supports business expansion and employment domestically. If trade both destroys jobs and creates jobs, what is the overall effect of an open trading system on domestic employment? Both economic theory and the available evidence strongly suggest that trade has little net effect on the economy's capacity to employ its workforce. In the long run, the workings of a competitive labor market, assisted perhaps by appropriate economic policies, ensure that jobs will be created that are commensurate with the size of the labor force and the available mix of worker skills. Thus, in the long run, factors such as population growth, education and training, labor force participation rates, and labor market institutions determine the level and composition of aggregate employment. In contrast, trade appears to have essentially no role in determining a country's long-run employment potential. To illustrate, between 1960 and 2003, the U.S. trade balance went from a small surplus (that is, an excess of exports over imports) to a large deficit, equal to about 4-1/2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). At the same time, the United States became a much more open economy; in dollar terms, imports (measured on a balance of payments basis) rose from just over 4 percent of GDP in 1960 to nearly 14 percent of GDP today. Yet the current unemployment rate of 5.6 percent is little changed from its level of 5.5 percent in 1960--a year in which, much like today, the economy was in the recovery phase from a recession. And of course, aggregate employment in the United States has grown greatly since 1960, by more than 60 million jobs. This increase in employment is significantly faster, by the way, than the growth of the population over the same period, in large part because of increased labor force participation by women. Evidently, increased exposure to trade notwithstanding, over the years the American economy has been able to generate the jobs needed to accommodate millions of new entrants to the labor force. Evidence from international comparisons also runs strongly counter to the view that trade depresses aggregate employment. Notably, despite its large trade deficit, the United States has experienced a significantly greater expansion in employment over the past decade than either Germany or Japan, both of which have enjoyed perennial trade surpluses. Although the labor force and labor-market institutions determine employment in the long run, short-run cyclical influences, such as transitory changes in spending or productivity, may cause employment to deviate from its long-run sustainable level. Even in the short run, however, there is no discernable link between aggregate employment and changes in trade volumes or the trade balance. For example, over the past two decades, even as U.S. trade has expanded rapidly, the quarter-to-quarter volatility of both output and employment has decreased noticeably, and recessions have become less frequent and milder than in earlier decades (Bernanke, 2004). In recent years, the sharpest deterioration in the U.S. trade balance occurred between 1997 and 2000, a time during which domestic employment was growing at a rapid pace. My focus thus far on the net effect of trade on jobs ignores the fact that those who lose jobs for trade-related reasons are not necessarily the same people who get the new jobs created by trade. Trade, like other factors resulting in structural change, can have noticeable effects on the mix of jobs across industries, skill levels, and locations. Those who lose jobs, whatever the cause of the dislocation, have real reason to be unhappy, because job loss often entails economic hardship--a point that I will shortly discuss in more detail. However, in our dynamic economy, jobs are created and destroyed in great numbers all the time. How important are trade-related factors in this ongoing process of job creation and destruction? To address the key area of public concern, I will focus here on the job-loss side of the equation. Estimates of the gross number of job losses associated with increased import penetration vary widely, but one representative calculation, by Lori Kletzer (2001), put the gross job loss due to imports at nearly 310,000 per year for the period from 1979 to 1999. I stress that Kletzer's estimate of gross job loss ignores any jobs created by trade, either directly or indirectly. The amount of "churn" in the U.S. labor market is enormous, a reflection of the continuous stream of entry, exit, and resizing of firms in our ever-changing economy. In order to get some perspective on Kletzer's estimate of trade-induced job loss, then, we should compare it to the number of workers who are displaced each year in the United States for all reasons, including firm or plant closings, corporate restructuring, automation, or the ending of fixed-term employment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), over the past ten years, gross job losses in the United States have averaged about 7.7 million jobs per quarter. Multiplying 7.7 million by four suggests that about 31 million U.S. jobs are eliminated each year. Research suggests, however, that because this number includes temporary layoffs, seasonal closings, and other job losses that are reversed within the year, it overstates longer-term job losses by about double (Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh, 1996). Hence, a reasonably conservative estimate is that, excluding seasonal and other short-term layoffs, about 15 million jobs are lost each year in the United States, equal to nearly 14 percent of the current level of nonfarm private employment. Of course, because net private-sector job creation in the United States over the past ten years has averaged more than 1.8 million per year, these losses were more than offset by the creation of about 17 million jobs per year during the same period. Truly, the U.S. labor market exhibits a phenomenal capacity for creative destruction. Comparing the 310,000 or so gross job losses per year that Kletzer (2001) attributes to increased imports to the 15 million total job losses, we find that only slightly more than 2 percent of gross job losses are the result of import competition. In other words, for the typical job loser during the past ten years, the chances are 98 percent that some factor other than competition from imports was the principal reason for displacement. Kletzer's calculations apply to the longer period since 1979. What about the current situation? Although U.S. employment stagnated for an extended period after the recovery got under way and has recently risen only slowly, there is little basis for blaming the recent poor employment performance on import competition. Indeed, as a share of GDP, imports to the United States have actually fallen since 2000, from 14.7 percent of GDP in 2000 to 13.7 percent in 2003. The worsening of the U.S. trade deficit as a share of GDP in recent years is entirely due to a fall in exports, from 10.9 percent of GDP in 2000 to 9.3 percent of GDP in 2003. Thus, to the extent that trade patterns are contributing at all to the current weakness in employment, the more relevant concern is that foreign economies are not growing as fast as our own and hence are not generating as much demand for our exports as we would like. Even if the overall level of employment is largely unaffected by trade, some have argued that trade adversely affects the composition of jobs, for example, by replacing relatively high-paid manufacturing jobs with lower-paid service-sector jobs. I will return shortly to the issue of why manufacturing employment has declined in the United States. I only note here that little evidence supports the view that trade has an adverse effect on wages or the mix of jobs in the economy as a whole. In particular, the often-expressed view that the ongoing shift of jobs from manufacturing to services has depressed earnings does not seem generally to be true. For example, during the 1990s, average earnings in manufacturing industries that showed net declines in employment (weighted by the number of job losses) were $10.63 per hour. During the same period, wages in expanding service-providing industries (weighted by the number of job gains) were $11.26 per hour, about 6 percent higher. What about Outsourcing Abroad? The debate about the effects of trade on employment has been intensified recently by an upsurge in trade in business services, popularly referred to as outsourcing abroad, or "offshoring." New interest by U.S. corporations in outsourcing white-collar activities has been driven by several factors, including improvements in international communications; the computerization and digitization of some business services; and the existence of educated, often English-speaking, workers abroad who will perform similar services for less pay. When feasible, offshoring has obvious attractions for business. Comparative wage data suggest why. Estimated average wages for software developers are $6 per hour in India, compared with $60 per hour in the United States (McKinsey Global Institute, 2003). Similarly, average wages for telephone operators are estimated to be less than $1 per hour in India and about $12.50 per hour in the United States (Bardhan and Kroll, 2003). (A portion, but certainly not all, of these wage differentials reflects differences in skills; for example, programmers in India generally perform simpler and more routine tasks than do those in the United States.) The increase in outsourcing abroad--particularly of activities previously considered immune to foreign competition--has led to dire predictions about a wholesale "export" of U.S. jobs in coming years. Although globalization will continue to be a force for economic change, the pace of change is likely to be slower than implied by such predictions. Outsourcing abroad has proved profitable primarily for jobs that can be routinized and sharply defined. For the foreseeable future, most high-value work will require creative interaction among employees, interaction that is facilitated by physical proximity, personal contact, and shared cultural experiences. Moreover, in many fields, closeness to customers and knowledge of local conditions are also of great importance. These observations suggest that, for some considerable time, outsourcing abroad will be uneconomical for many types of jobs, particularly high-value jobs. Fundamentally, the outsourcing of business services abroad is not a new phenomenon. In an increasingly interdependent world economy, trade in services, like trade in goods, is being harnessed to the goals of cutting costs and expanding production. That outsourcing abroad benefits the receivers as well as the providers of outsourced services has been shown by empirical studies. For example, Catherine Mann (2004) has estimated that outsourcing abroad has reduced prices of IT hardware 10 to 30 percent, boosting the diffusion of information technology throughout the U.S. economy and raising both productivity and growth by a very significant amount--0.3 percentage point per year. The McKinsey Global Institute (2003) finds that for every dollar of activity outsourced to India, the United States receives between $1.12 and $1.14 in economic benefits. As with trade in general, it is useful to ask how much outsourcing abroad contributes to gross job loss in the United States. Unfortunately, as with trade in general, measures of gross job loss associated with outsourcing abroad are scarce. An analysis by Goldman-Sachs (2003) estimated that U.S producers shifted between 300,000 and 500,000 jobs abroad during the past three years, an average of between 100,000 and 167,000 jobs per year since 2000. This estimate includes jobs both inside and outside manufacturing (that is, it includes both goods and services) and reflects increased imports from foreign affiliates of U.S. corporations. Based on this analysis, Goldman-Sachs argues that, over the next several years, offshoring of business services may rise to several hundred thousand jobs per year. Again, to gain perspective, we should compare these estimates with the overall rate of job displacement in the United States. Two hundred thousand jobs per year amount to a bit more than 1 percent of the 15 million or so jobs that are lost each year in the U.S. economy for all reasons. Quantitatively, outsourcing abroad simply cannot account for much of the recent weakness in the U.S. labor market and does not appear likely to be an important restraint to further recovery in employment. Moreover, a balanced discussion of outsourcing abroad should reflect the fact that, just as U.S. firms use the services of foreigners, foreign firms make considerable use of the services of U.S. residents. An underappreciated fact is that, in contrast to its trade deficit in goods, the United States runs a significant trade surplus in services. The official trade data do not have direct measures of outsourcing of services abroad, but much of what we would consider offshoring is likely included under the heading "Business, Professional, and Technical Services," a category of trade in services. In 2002, the latest year for which complete data are available, the United States exported nearly $29 billion in business services. Against these exports, U.S. imports of business services in 2002 totaled less than $11 billion (about 0.1 of 1 percent of U.S. GDP), for an overall surplus in business services trade of $18 billion. Moreover, U.S. exports of business services have increased $3.5 billion since 2000, a period during which imports of business services increased only $2 billion. An important reason for the U.S. trade surplus in business services is that this country provides many high-value services to users abroad, including financial, legal, engineering, architectural, and software development services, while many of the services imported by U.S. companies are less sophisticated and hence of lower cost. As discussions of the outsourcing of business services tend to ignore the large amount of "insourcing" of services to the United States from other countries, so do discussions of American firms moving jobs abroad ignore the fact that foreign firms also move jobs to the United States. Between 1997 and 2001 (the most recent data available), employment of U.S. residents by affiliates of foreign companies operating within the United States increased by about 1.2 million jobs. In 2001, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies accounted for nearly $500 billion in gross output (about half in manufacturing) and about $164 billion in exports. Globalization and outsourcing work both ways. So Why Is the Recovery Jobless? We have little evidence to show that trade in general, or outsourcing abroad in particular, is a major source of net job loss. Yet, two-and-a-half years into the economic recovery, the pace of job creation in the United States has been distressingly slow. Job losses in manufacturing have been particularly deep, with employment in that sector apparently only now beginning to stabilize after falling by almost 3 million jobs since 2000. Why has the recovery been largely jobless thus far? In a speech presented last November (Bernanke, 2003), I discussed a number of factors underlying the reluctance of U.S. firms to increase their workforces. I concluded then, and continue to believe, that the single most important factor explaining lagging job creation is the astonishing gains in labor productivity that have been achieved in the U.S. economy in the past few years. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased 4.3 percent in 2002 and 5.4 percent in 2003. For comparison, productivity advanced at an average rate of 2.5 percent per year from 1996 to 2000, a period that was viewed at the time to be one of exceptionally strong productivity growth. Most economists would agree that new information and communication technologies, together with organizational changes facilitated by those technologies, have been an important source of these impressive productivity gains. Note that, because the productivity figures are based on measures of domestically produced output and domestic employment, to a first approximation cost savings reflected by outsourcing abroad are not reflected in, and thus cannot explain, the recent surge in productivity. The gains in domestic labor productivity are great news for Americans in the long run, as they will promote higher wages, profits, and living standards in this country. In the short term, however, increased productivity has permitted the U.S. business sector to meet strong final demand for its output without having to hire significant numbers of new workers. The effect of productivity gains has been particularly marked in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Productivity gains of 3.8 percent in 2001, 6.4 percent in 2002, and 5.8 percent in 2003 (as reported by the BLS) have permitted U.S. manufacturers to reach levels of production only about two percent below the cyclical peak in mid-2000, despite the sharp decline in employment. The general trend toward higher productivity and decreased employment in manufacturing has been observed for decades in the United States, although the process has recently intensified. Other countries have had similar experiences. For example, while U.S. manufacturing employment has declined 18 percent since 1990, the comparable figure for Japan is nearly 22 percent and for the United Kingdom it is more than 27 percent. Developing countries have experienced a similar pattern. Even China, supposedly the destination of U.S. manufacturing jobs, has seen manufacturing employment shrink by more than 15 percent since its peak in 1995. The long-run trend in manufacturing in the United States and other industrialized countries is similar to what occurred earlier in agriculture. At one time a majority of the U.S. population lived on farms. However, agricultural productivity has improved so much over the years that, although farm workers make up only about 2-1/2 percent of the workforce, they are able both to feed the nation and (as noted earlier) export substantial quantities of food as well. When will the U.S. economy begin to create jobs in significant numbers? The recent rates of productivity growth are unprecedented, and hence likely unsustainable. Thus, if output growth continues at its current robust pace, job creation will surely follow. However, because we do not know exactly how either productivity or aggregate spending will evolve, predicting the timing of a jobs resurgence is difficult. Although, like many economists, I have been surprised by the unusually slow recovery of the labor market, I continue to believe that steady improvement in the labor market over the remainder of this year is the most likely outcome. What Can Policy Do? I have argued today that, in general, increased trade does not reduce employment and, more specifically, that trade bears little responsibility for the recent slow pace of job creation in the United States. Moreover, the economy taken as a whole clearly benefits from trade. Still, as I have noted, to say that the U.S. economy benefits from trade is not to say that every individual American worker or family benefits, or that the structural changes induced by trade are not disruptive. Clearly, some workers who have been displaced or have had a difficult time finding work during the past three years can accurately claim to have been made worse off by international competition. Job loss in particular causes significant hardships for affected workers. For example, an analysis by Henry Farber (2003), using BLS data on workers displaced for any reason, suggests that only about two-thirds of displaced workers found re-employment within three years, with some settling for part-time work. Even when successful in finding full-time work, displaced workers experience on average a decline in earnings on the new job of about 8 percent. Focusing on workers displaced by trade in particular, Kletzer (2001) found that job losers in industries facing high levels of import competition were slightly less likely to be re-employed and experienced greater earnings losses, at about 13 percent on average, than workers displaced from industries facing less import competition. What can be done to help workers who lose their jobs because of competition from imports? Attempts to restrict trade through the imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other trade barriers are not a good solution. Such actions may temporarily slow job loss in affected industries. But they do so by imposing on the overall economy costs that typically are many times greater than the benefits. In the short run, the costs of trade barriers include higher prices for consumers and higher costs (and thus reduced competitiveness) for U.S. firms. Trade barriers typically provoke retaliation from trading partners as well, with potentially large costs for exporters. And history shows that in the longer run, economic isolationism and retreat from international competition lead to bloated, inefficient industries, lower productivity, and lower living standards. The better policy approach is two-pronged. First, at the macro level, policy should be directed at helping to ensure that jobs become available for those who have been displaced. In particular, over time, appropriate monetary policies can help the economy achieve maximum employment with low inflation, irrespective of the trade situation. The nation's trade policies, rather than attempting to restrict trade, should be used to push for even more trade. By opening markets abroad, trade policy provides greater opportunities for U.S. firms and workers. The second piece of a constructive policy toward trade is to help displaced workers train for and find new work. Some steps in this direction have been taken. Currently, the government's principal program for helping workers displaced by trade is the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, or TAA. The Congress has recently extended the TAA through 2007, while adding a special TAA program for older workers and a separate TAA program for farmers. The TAA program offers up to two and a half years of job training, allowances for job search and relocation, and income support for eligible workers, the latter for up to 104 weeks after the initial 26 weeks of conventional unemployment insurance benefits have been exhausted. The recently passed legislation also provides for health insurance assistance for some eligible workers. The U.S. Department of Labor certified about 208,000 workers for trade adjustment assistance during fiscal year 2003, spending $551 million on the program. Finally, although current TAA legislation is generally interpreted to apply only to jobs displaced in manufacturing, bills to extend TAA to service-sector workers were introduced this month in both the House and Senate. TAA is certainly not a perfect program. A recent report by the General Accounting Office (2001) described the challenges of effectively retraining older, less-educated workers. It noted also that TAA does not address all the problems of communities that have suffered from plant closings and the like. More general criticisms can be raised about the program: First, in a complex and interdependent economy, identifying workers affected by trade is not always a straightforward matter. Second, one may well wonder why workers displaced by trade should be assisted but not workers displaced by other factors, such as restructuring or automation. Lately, a number of proposals have been advanced to help displaced workers more generally, including changes in law that increase the portability of pension and health benefits. Other proposals include a program of "wage insurance," which would help to cushion the wage loss that often occurs when job losers take new jobs (Kletzer and Litan, 2001) and tax credits for firms that invest in worker training (Mann, 2003, 2004). Time does not permit me to evaluate these and other alternative proposals today. Instead I will conclude by noting that helping displaced workers is good policy for at least three reasons. First, reducing the burdens borne by displaced workers is the right and fair thing to do. Second, helping workers who have lost jobs find new productive work is good for the economy as well as for the affected workers and their families. Finally, if workers are less fearful of change, less pressure will be exerted on politicians to erect trade barriers or to take other actions that would reduce the flexibility and dynamism of the U.S. economy. In the long run, avoiding economic isolationism and maintaining economic dynamism will pay big dividends for everybody. References Bardhan, Ashok, and Cynthia Kroll (2003).

Indeed, even if an individual is more efficient in every activity than other people, it will still be to his or her benefit to specialize in production and then to trade for other goods and services. Although they are not responsible for my conclusions, I am grateful to Board staff members for superb assistance in the preparation of this talk. Data are for the period 1992:Q3 to 2003:Q2 and are drawn from the BLS's Business Establishment Dynamics survey. The term outsourcing alone refers to the shift of activities outside the corporation, including the use of domestic as well as foreign suppliers. I will use the phrases outsourcing abroad or offshoring to denote outsourcing to foreign suppliers. The economic importance of physical proximity is the underlying reason that individuals and businesses are willing to pay high rents and other costs to live in or near major cities, where they can be near large numbers of other people and businesses that have related expertise and interests. Comparing data for 1999 and 2003 to eliminate the largest effects of the high-tech boom- and-bust cycle, Mann also shows that U.S. employment in several white-collar occupations related to IT or deemed vulnerable to IT-enabled outsourcing has in fact been stable or expanded modestly. Although my focus today is on the United States, we should not ignore the benefits of outsourcing to countries that provide these services. Software developers and telephone operators who provide offshore services from a country such as India are afforded a precious opportunity for economic advancement, and their country as a whole becomes richer, more competitive, and more integrated into the world trading system. Moreover, outsourced service jobs do not typically bring along collateral issues of potential environmental damage and poor working conditions that have concerned some critics of expanded trade. Some components of this category probably contain little outsourcing, for example, construction services, whereas some categories outside Business, Professional, and Technical Services, for example, telecommunications, may contain significant amounts of outsourced services. None of the conclusions drawn in the text is changed by considering the subcategories in greater detail. In the broader category of Other Private Services, of which Business, Technical, and Professional Services is a subset, in 2003 the United States had a trade surplus of $53.6 billion, up from $41.7 billion in 1997. The qualification to a first approximation is included because outsourcing will affect measured domestic labor productivity if it leads to a significant change in the skills and wage composition of domestic jobs. However, outsourcing abroad almost certainly explains little of the recent increase in labor productivity; indeed, if outsourcing results in the loss of high-skill, high-wage jobs in the United States, as many fear, its effect would be to lower rather than to raise domestic labor productivity. Production is measured here by the manufacturing component of the industrial production index. Data are from country sources and may not be precisely comparable. Latest data for China are for 2002. There are questions about the reliability of Chinese data, and part of the decline in Chinese manufacturing employment reflects the closure of state-owned enterprises. According to opinion polls, the public is far more willing to accept free trade policies if they are accompanied by assistance for workers and firms that may be damaged by trade (Kull, Ramsay, Subias, and Lewis, 2004).
